Cozymeal,1ds35q5l747ku803,4.0,"Cozymeal has provided a unique experience which has allowed me to work on my skills as a food photographer and the flexibility to determine my hours based on my own availability. So far, Cozymeal's pay has been fair but you do not receive pay until the following month on the 15th which is extremely inconvenient. I have not received more than two shoots per month so I wouldn't call this  a part time job.rt"
Cozymeal,1ef60psmr3dkl000,1.0,Don’t believe the 6000-8000/ month.  That probably represents a TINY fraction of their Chefs.  I worked for months and had excellent customer reviews yet made around minimum wage.  I have over 10 years Restaurant Chef Experience.  I could elaborate- but why bother.  This IS a good learning and growth experience for newer  Chefs- but don’t expect to make real $.  Traveling Chef pay is very low.  IF you can teach larger classes at your restaurant or home AND they actually book you could possibly rely on this scheme for reliable income.
Cozymeal,1e7ddcf23o24m800,1.0,This is great for home cooks but not for professional chefs or private chefs and should be illegal to conduct dinners like this without meeting health codes. You are playing with your life and career when working or hiring some home chef without any professional training. I’m sure myself and other trained chefs would agree that it’s insulting to us. It’s a disgrace when people wake up and decide “oh I like to cook let me become a “chef”. Can we wake up and call purselves doctors?
Cozymeal,1e3q5kskgp3po805,1.0,"Although a great idea, the company takes entirely too much and constantly asks for more.  You are required to host parties of two and for the time, effort and money you end up in the negative yet Cozymeal takes a nice chunk of change and is unwilling to negotiate commission.   Having been a private chef to high net worth individuals for many years the pay scale from Cozymeal is a no go for me."
Cozymeal,1dkbfa81jh40l802,4.0,"As a part-time position, I have the flexibility to work around my schedule. The assignments are fun and interesting. The management is very responsive and supportive. I enjoy the creativity of this job the most."
Cozymeal,1dh26c8d6h3pe800,5.0,I really do love and enjoy working for cozymeal. You're basically your own boss and cozymeal helps you with most of the work. As a chef Instructor I get to turn my passion into money as well as meet different people all the time. I would highly recommend anyone interested in working for cozymeal to apply.
Cozymeal,1dgvgrvl7h3hq801,5.0,"Becoming a Cozymeal chef is one of the smartest decisions I have ever made. It is the perfect blend between cooking and instructing. As a Cozymeal chef, I am 100% in control of my calendar. I work when I am able to. I am able to travel across the DFW area and meet new people who are interested in sharing an interactive cooking experience with a trained professional. My platform within Cozymeal is to provide the most tailored fit experience for the customer, so their expectations are far exceeded. I ensure my customers have a day filled with cooking and tidbits of information to help increase their daily cooking. Filling a person with confidence to cook at home is worth its weight in gold. I encourage rolling the dice and seeing what all Cozymeal could hold for you."
Cozymeal,1dgsk3a0e5nde800,5.0,"I have been leading cooking classes with Cozymeal since November 2019.  This has been overwhelmingly a positive experience. I design the menu, I host the event and they bring you the leads/diners.  Cheffing with Cozymeal is not a full-time commitment, as you allot a set number of days that you're available to teach cooking classes to guests. The staff have been very supportive and always reply promptly to my questions. If you have a flexible schedule (especially if you're available on weekend evenings/afternoons), Cozymeal is a great way to flex your creative menu-making skills while connecting with new potential private clients. I love meeting new people and the flexibility to teach when/where I want. This is not a full-time restaurant gig and chefs should understand that before applying."
Cozymeal,1dgrf8jvv52tu800,5.0,"I have been a Chef with Cozymeal in the San Diego area for over 3 years now. Since teaching my very first class. I have considered myself very lucky to be a part of such a great company. I love the flexibility of Cozymeal. Allowing the Chef to make there own menu, pricing, and schedule. Cozymeal is a amazing concept that is only going to grow. If you are on the fence about giving it a shot. I would highly recommend this low-risk, big reward opportunity."
Cozymeal,1dgquieqjh44v800,5.0,"Freedom to create menu. Flexible schedule. Sometimes too much work, sometimes very few work."
Cozymeal,1dd5ggqgmh3v8800,5.0,Cozymeal gives me the possibility to meet new people and taste great dishes prepared by the best chefs in the city I live. I really enjoy this job cause it's fun and I am constantly evaluating all the chefs I photoshoot and their food.
Cozymeal,1d5nvaj94aqgk800,2.0,Just like working uber or Lyft. You do all the work take all the risks and company does very little. You are a commodity not an employee.
Cozymeal,1cvp5bfol1fdv000,5.0,My time at Cozymeal not only allowed me to sharpen my writing skills but it also fostered a very supportive environment that allowed me to pursue to a great deal of creative freedom.
Cozymeal,1c8id6h7fbrfta2d,5.0,"Great support and positive work environment,  Good compensation and terrific marketing plan for Chefs.  Great exposure to community, and excellent platform for demonstrating your skills."
Cozymeal,1bs9jmkfvb83i9h7,5.0,"Cozymeal, as a freelance contractor, was a great place to work. I worked many hours with the CEO and found him very clever and hardworking. He's kind but very business minded."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f7mmtehqn59q800,5.0,"Embassy Suites is a great company to work for! Competitive rates, flexible schedules and many opportunities for advancement. Their Make A Difference and Make it Right culture has helped me to provide outstanding service to guests and continue to be a team player and help out where needed!!"
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f7gvhb63t3q7800,5.0,"On a typical day, I would check people in, help with luggage, troubleshoot issues that may arise, and make sure guests had everything needed for a comfortable stay. I like this company very much"
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f72dq8k1o1dh800,4.0,"Reception attendant as my first job, loved the team I worked with and the bosses were all kind. We even volunteered as a team a few times as well, would recommend"
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f6q5u83uhijp800,5.0,"Working at the front desk helped me grow thick skin abd become confident with talking to strangers. Very rewarding job. Responsibilites included making reservations over the phone, online, and in person. Respond to any conflicts from in house guest, and much much more. During slower times, I was able to sit and use my phone. Free embassy breakfast too! If I wasant relocating to another city, I would have stayed here for years."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f6oiitna3obs000,4.0,People are great to work with and plenty of opportunities for advancement if hospitality industry is where you want to be.  Work life balance can be hard.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f6o6c86ns9vq800,1.0,Very disappointed with how HEI handled their employees since COVID. I haven’t spoken with the new General Manager EVER. I’ve been “furloughed” for over a year with absolutely no communication from upper management.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f6fik1pm3ocs000,1.0,"There's a lot of ""this is the way we've always done it. There is a cast of hardstuck unmotivated managers that make working there difficult. The staff constantly takes advantage of this and it is hard to accomplish things."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f65s84s73ocs000,3.0,"Nice company to work for on a part time basis. Coworkers were family so working events and other shifts were fun. There’s always food and entertainment so it’s always interesting, even when you don’t know what you’ll be walking in to."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f5p7krqtsa39800,5.0,It is incredible company to work for in many ways and if you looking forward to have great benefits Embassy Suites by Hilton it is the best !
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f5j039enu2n1800,1.0,Room filters hadn’t been changed in over a year and a half. Mold inside of every toilet tank. If you peel the wallpaper off behind the TVs the drywall is covered in mold. Corporate does not pay vendors. The absolute worst company to work for
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f4vbqrjsu392800,5.0,Being very productive an having a positive attitude like working with people very dependable.Im very outgoing like working.Im very respectful i like to try new things.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f4f58efqt5m6800,5.0,Great leadership and pay along with discounts on hotels if you love to travel. Management works very hard and will not ask you to do something that they won’t do. Coworkers are easy to get along with as well.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f4166hvmu1vt800,5.0,"Overall it was nice working there. Most of the people were nice and they did their best to make the employees feel appreciated. When covid hit positions were lost but if I had an opportunity to work there again, I would."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f40fuhj6u1vt800,3.0,"low pay, not sure if ownership changed but the amount of stress was not worth my health, there was a high turnover with different staff and knew the reason why"
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f3m86noa3guf000,5.0,I loved working for Hilton. It was fun and every day was different. Guests were nice and the staff was like one big happy(mostly) family. I would definitely work there again.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f2s6ves7him2800,5.0,"This was my 2nd hospitality job and I learned so much. In just 18 months, I trained in almost every department and trained other people in my department. I was given space to take initiative and make suggestions for my manager and GM. I felt they were really invested in my success. Pay wasn’t great but the environment management created was enough for me to stay."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f2pm401ru1v3800,4.0,"Very fast paced environment, you learn quickly. Management is okay, they will overwork you just beware! And not enough pay either. And get the worst type of customers since it’s so affordable."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f2lg3q96him2800,1.0,No advancement for this job expected to work a lot for $11 maximum. You can only advance if you have a bachelors degree in hospitality in restaurant management.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f2l02fbuu1v3800,1.0,Very unorganized. No one knows anything. Management is not interested in listening to suggestions from their employees. Never worked for a company thst is so unorganized.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dcahlsphh3gh800,3.0,good i will work here for summer. Working hours are long
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f1is1880u40q800,1.0,The management is the worst I have ever worked for. Disorganized and unsupportive in all aspects. Unable to make any money there. This franchisee is having serious financial trouble. Stay away.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f1aoa299n53l800,3.0,"I applied on Indeed and was hired on the spot, and started a week later. Unfortunately I only lasted 5 days because the level of unprofessionalism in the Houskeeping department was almost appalling. I had no training whatsoever, the only employees there have no positive energy because of the environment provided for them. They have such a high turnover that the head of housekeeping has only been there for 4 months, and they have a hard time keeping employees as they keep pushing them out with their morning pep-talks of ""Leave if you can't do the job"""
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f0gmtlvtn54g800,4.0,"A decent place to work. The manager however was not very nice.who expected you to climb mount everest without oxygen then get mad when u pass out from lack of oxygen. Other than that, it was good."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f0g5raojo1hv800,1.0,They retaliate and are very childish upset them and your on their bad list they purposely ignore/avoid employees if they’re upset with you they promise you positions but nothing ever happens
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1f01tt1vcu4d4801,4.0,Dinner time rush was not to bad but when it came time to acctulay be busy you would be the only one in the entire kitchen. Many times I was there way past my out time since there was no dishwasher at times and I was forced to clean for banquets and the line while cooking and closing.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1evv636b5u1sg800,3.0,"Loved working in my department. But Higher management was horrible. Each department felt like they hated eachother. No room for advancement. Messed up paychecks, overworked"
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1ev0eeruvn55l800,5.0,I truly enjoy working here and they have a family environment what's a lot of employees having 10 plus years at the company.  Not a lot of room for advancement.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1euu0k0qen55l800,2.0,"It's unorganized, they don't tell you anything and they expect you to know information they keep to themselves. They don't care if they over work you and they expect you to help other departments but don't require other departments help you."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1eur2nc8gu1ib800,3.0,I spent more time defending myself and explaining that I am doing my job here than actually doing my job. Security management put a lot of energy toward proving that I was not doing a job that I was indeed doing. They also expect security to engage suspects in the middle of the night unarmed.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1eume91edu1ki800,5.0,Head house keeper it was nice to work for embassy suite it wasn't bad at all I had a good time at embassy suites but when I got hurt they gave me workman's comp that's why I went to another job but it was not bad at all
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1eueaob65u1ki800,1.0,"This place is very beautiful. But the people within aren’t as supportive. I’ve been there for two years and I’ve never worked at a place with no structure at all. I’m just there to be there, which I’ve never thought I would feel."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1eudsuv99u1ib800,5.0,I over all enjoyed my time there and would highly recommend it as a career. I happened to be there during the beginning of Covid and they closed completely or I would still be working at Embassy.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1eu4kihd4t48m800,3.0,"Pay was not great, but you get a chance for a small raise every six months. I did not collect health insurance benefits from this place personally, but my coworkers who did said the coverage was mediocre at best. Never enough staff to meet the demands of the job."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1etn8qk7bt48m800,5.0,Managers really focus on the growth and development of their teams. They are accommodating to personal needs really support you. Your department leaders are willing to work with you and know that if you are at your best you will work your best.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1etmsdflqu312800,4.0,I would say the workers stand out because everyone works diligently. For me it's the guests because i try to build a rapport with them and the majority of them are very nice.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1etmbddcht48m800,4.0,I love working there at first until a new person can along and didn't work as a team player but pointing fingers at others and always sit in office and didn't help
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1etijtshfu221800,3.0,"This was one of the first places I worked at, and it was a good starting point. Busy and I got to meet a lot of different people. Pay could’ve been better, but overall it wasn’t too bad. It was brand new at the time, so we were typically understaffed and management wasn’t too helpful."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1etadieplu1lf800,5.0,"Great company to work for. A family environment. Management cares about it's staff. Many people there have been affected by the pandemic, but before them, many had been with us for 20+ years."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1et31mjk4p113800,3.0,"It could get really busy and tough at times, but the staff is well train during my time there that we supported each no matter what. The employee's are what made the hotel run smoothly,"
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1et2bs56i3kkj000,4.0,"There a bunch of Chinese And women A lot of kids Ver Friendly , love the cook banquets plenty of money never have to worry another uniform even if your across the team"
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dcahlsphh3gh800,3.0,good i will work here for summer. Working hours are long
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1et05iql8u1n1800,2.0,All middle management is an immediate or extended relative of the General Manager so you'll never move up regardless of your superior job performance.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1esqi1c1vt4lr800,3.0,"It's a pretty cool place to work. I like most of the people. Pay isn't bad when we have events. Biggest complaint will obviously be people in power (GM of hotel, managers, etc.) They definitely have their favorites and they are not shy about showing it."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1esjgh9c5npic800,5.0,There is always work to be done. I can stay busy at work   I really enjoy staying busy and completing a project in a timely manner. All employees are wonderful to work with. Embassy Suites Atrium Hospitality treat their employees with respect
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1esggvsv5t4l7800,5.0,"As a former employee, when I worked there I loved the team.  Management was fair and understanding. Goals and targets were difficult but achievable.  The management company dictates the level of pressure and when I worked there it was manageable."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1esb24huhu418800,4.0,"I liked working here while going to school, fairly low stress. I only got one 20 cent raise in the two years that i worked there. Scheduling was always worked with."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1es1viac13ogl000,1.0,"- Keep in mind that this includes before the hotel opening, during, and after. -"
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1erjesl4ksa99800,4.0,Working here allows you to meet new people and annual regulars. A lot of conventions happen at this location so you get to have an on going relationship with customers that come every year to events.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1erc5dokqsa99800,5.0,Since covid 19 I have lost my job at the hotel I wish to go back i miss everyone and I loved doing my job I really miss the guest and everyone i worked with

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1eqc4hntfu35m800,4.0,The short amount of time that I did work for this organization everything was great. Learned new ways and how to do things that I didn't learn in school.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1eq9ih8qju49m800,2.0,I was hired as a pantry cook which I thought I would be on the line but I wasn’t. I was mostly in banquets which I didn’t mind but I wasn’t really doing the cooking. I had no idea that I would work in the concession stand which is not in the job description. We never got off on which made things difficult to send time with people. I was told to think of the schedule as a guide line. One of my coworkers went on my phone and turn off my music which I was forced to listen to there music.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1eq9c376nu49m800,5.0,I loved my time at Embassy. The team was great. We all got along and we’re supported but our manger and GM. It was a hotel so yeah dealing with guest could be stressful but I was supported by my mangers.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1eq92cmi1u49m800,5.0,Good pay and hours. Friendly competition workers and happy work place. It's fast paced. Very professional work environment. Very nice supervisor.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1epnqknd1u35m800,3.0,They try to work with you on scheduling.  Not sure now how they operate now.  Pay is lower then others on tower rd. I sho his of had s higher salary because I had over 30 yrs in the industry. Wasn't offered benefits because I was part time.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1epfhrocmu38g800,3.0,Was a great place to work until they decided to change all management. Then everything fell apart. Horrible management which resulted in a bunch of people leaving.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1ep5f61s52v69000,4.0,Just have long hours and no proper training they don’t communicate well at all  very high turnover rate  and  sometimes you have to stay late even if your done with your room
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1eoprbn15u1e3800,3.0,I spent several days in different departments. Overall the job is demanding and the industry needs updating in safety and job culture. Not well paid
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1eoiq8b91u1e3800,5.0,Great place to work. I meet many people from around the world and still keep in touch with some. I dropped groups and families off to local attractions and recommended things to them that family's would enjoy. The only downside would be when multiple phone calls would come at the same time for pickup.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1eofonnokocq7800,5.0,It is a really good company who cares about the worker. The management here could be better but overall it is working and working pretty well. Its a good place.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1enumsrnpo15h800,1.0,They really dont pay well and they over work you just so they dont have to hire more people. Drama is always going on and they dont value their employees.

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1enu3bba1u1tu800,1.0,Work-life balance
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1entn998bt44v800,1.0,Not a great place to work. You don't get the sense that you're cared for by management. In fact you get the attitude they could care less. If you work there beware.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1enq45tnqu1tu800,4.0,"It was a fun place to work. The people i worked with were mostly awesome. Somedays could get a little hectic depending on what was going on in the hotel. Everybody helped out from front desk, floor attendants, managers the gm. It was like a circle of friends who all wanted the best for every department."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1enp6r92ut44v800,5.0,"Honestly, I have nothing negative to say about my time with Embassy Suites. Upper management communicated with lower management, the team members were amazing, and the compensation for my time was appreciated. I would say though that some of the clientele were not ideal. When so much is included in their stay, free breakfast and evening reception, a lot of them are very picky in regards to what is offered for free."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1enhliv4oo15h800,1.0,That entire building needs to be reworked. They need to review their staff. Worst experience of my life working there and absolutely no one is following the states COVID regulations in that building.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1engj6dpot44v800,1.0,"Management is terrible, alot of micromanaging from the gm and a front end manager who thinks shes the gm. Theres hardly any flexibility in the schedule, they frown upon it when you wanna take vacation time. And the pay is awful. The people that work at this location are very two faced, they will be best friends face to face, but when you step out they try to throw you under the bus. The hotel itself is old and falling apart, the guests are disrespectful and absolute slobs. Also another thing is theres a virus going on out there and this place does not enforce the mask rule there are many guests that dont wear anything on there face.  I would not recommend this place to anyone unless your really in desperate need of a job."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1enc8gtqonpgg800,5.0,"great company to work for, really depends on management at each property as far as the environment, you're never working alone which is nice since its a full service property so lots of support for any issues or complains that arise"
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1ena4522iu1av800,4.0,busy     hotel      with     a     fun      staff      working       hard.        free lunch      was     a    nice     benefit     as       well.  the hotel has a lot of tour busses that use the facility so it goes from really quiet to kinda crazy real quick.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1emupst37o22b800,4.0,I remember being a young man and coming to orientation here. I still have friends that I made from this job today and we still talk. This job helped defined who we are nowadays. I really miss those days sometimes. I know they will never be back

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1emeivhuku1ac800,4.0,"I only work the for a year in a have as paid intern, it a fun and good place to work, especially  if you in the banquet department. We have a really nice executive chef/f and b director/ it personnel his very helpful to the staff"
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1emciuknls7e8800,5.0,"I loved every minute of working here.  Everyone was friendly and would help you in any way possible.  Management deeply cares about the employees and will jump in to help if needed -- this includes cleaning rooms, inspecting rooms, transporting laundry, etc. The property is a little dated and there are plans to remodel.  If it were not for coronavirus, I would still be there."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1emb5tl51s7du800,3.0,"Working as a server, you get paid a $2.30 paycheck most places with the the exception of tips. Here, you got paid $9.50, plus tips. The location attracted all walks of life and the interacting/socializing with guests was always the awesome. I became pregnant during my time there and respectful told my superiors. They immediate shift in respect was very noticeable and I also began to be the only person scheduled on the floor almost every shift and for almost big event. The work started to make me ill, which resulted in me having to cut my schedule down, even though I was eager to work, they were working me to death. They then fired me for wanting to be part time."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1elvddhgou2u5800,4.0,It is a great job I  have learned different objectives while working here.   The co workers are very nice and some are helpful when needed.  We have to be open to new ideas.  Salary should be a little more than what they r.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1els7d4aos7e8800,5.0,"Hilton has great standards for their branded hotels. Each day presents it's own challenges and no two days are the same. Hilton empowers all associates to try and resolve a guest's issues however they see fit, which I think is fantastic. Benefits usually aren't great, but wages are fair, and advancement opportunity is there if you want it."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1elc60j31s7ic800,3.0,Good benefits but if you work at a franchise then you’re pretty much on your own . Otherwise you great discounts on rooms and free food . Coworkers are nice .

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1ejeeda9nnptn800,2.0,"It's a good jumping off place. Because this hotel brand caters to people of all classes, you will need to learn how to work with people such as your best service wasn't good enough, and the guest who pays the minimum and demands for the maximum."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1eibm95k5sqbl800,5.0,Loved my job until I was laid off in March 2020 due to COVID19.  Now I am looking for a new job because this job will probably not be available for at least a year.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1ei745cm1rfvu800,2.0,No advancement room at the Montgomery locale. No one cares about helping you to go further in the company. Going the extra mile is unnoticed. HR is in the business that doesn't pay her. She needs to handle HR duties and stop stirring workplace drama.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1ehsp8dflrfvu800,5.0,Fun place to work. Great travel benefits and offers health insurance. Company is adapting well to current COVID-19 crisis. Fast paced environment with great support from management and coworkers.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1ehqk890tro7r800,1.0,"Very hostile work environment for Minorities. Management racists and very inexperienced. If you are looking for a place of growth and positive environment, DO NOT WORK HERE. Worst job experience in the history of my Hotel Career"

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1ehlrkjqf377s000,5.0,The GM and the DOS are wonderful to work with.  Their expectations are clear and questions that arise while completing a project are welcome. The front office team and the housekeeping teams are dedicated and hard working. The food and beverage team are engaging and professional.  The sales team is a fun supportive collection of talented individuals.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1ehdfg462r78q800,4.0,"Alot of work, corporate  did not support the hotel.. people are friendly. inhouse management was wonderful. everything in the hotel is in bad shape and the department was under staff."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1eh3k6vpvoh9o800,5.0,"Honestly, this being my first job, I could not have had a better experience. I stayed for 2 years with the company and would have stayed longer had I not moved. I left the company with excellent customer service skills, thanks to the management staff. Our weekly team building meeting is what made our customer service so impeccable. Management always encouraged leadership from there team. They gave us the autonomy, to be the hero in every situation. Embassy Suites played a part in shaping my work behavioral style."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1eh0rr2furd28800,2.0,I’ve had 3 general managers since working here. They haven’t done anything about housekeeping not cleaning room’s properly or that front desk is being blamed and everything is being thrown on front desk.

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1egjhcchmqh1c800,5.0,Its a stable well rounded job with many things to learn and do each day. Hospitality is a both hands on and hands off approach to customer service that I enjoy.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1egcp88k3r3bb800,1.0,"I currently work here. I am going on my second month and I had to go to HR in my third week of working. The duties are for two to three people but assigned to one person. The housekeepers and supervisors are very demanding and super unhelpful. Promises made in my initial interview were not kept and there’s no flexibility or potential growth at all. I am probably not going to be working here after tomorrow due the housekeepers and supervisor literally giving me an anxiety attack because of a consistent onslaught of demands outside of my job description. When I went to HR I was told that although they are aware some housekeepers are bullies I should just deal and not take it to heart. It’s mind boggling, the experience I’m having here is just really something out of a nightmare. I seriously would not recommend working in the environmental services department. As for the other departments I cannot say but they seem to functioning well with a friendly and understanding atmosphere."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1eg975e4h0jdh000,4.0,Staff are very friendly and helpful. Just as any business it had it's troubles amongst some employees with their minor irritations. Felt at moments could and should have been dealt with immediately with certain staff. But that's my opinion. But it definitely was a work load for someone. Lot's to keep up with and no time to just sit around a do nothing. Very busy. But overall I like the place. It kept me going. The guests' were great and it was fun to be there.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1eg8qps7kre2b800,4.0,"Good place to work for, it does have the good and bad. Mostly good, managers are nice and understand your needs. The hotel is located by the John Wayne Airport."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1eg20imle3gjp000,5.0,I lost my job due to COVID and they have no reasoning for bringing me back at this point in time due to current circumstances.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1efvin58g3chj000,1.0,"Overall, management doesn’t care. GM walks right besides you and will not smile or greet you. Sometimes., a “hey” but with a dry tone. The cafeteria food sucks, seriously. The GM would say it’s great food but we will never see him eat it, how ironic. They don’t want union and pretty much advise you not to talk to union in every meeting. If you do, they fire you. HR is never there. If they are, they just sit in their office and are not productive or helpful. It was a busy hotel, before COVID. After COVID, management never reached out to check on our well-being. Yes, we got a meeting like 2 months after via zoom. They laid-off everyone and called the junior employees. They did not call senior employees who have been loyal to their company for years. According to them, they called employees who have more experience in different departments which makes no sense. Most of the junior employees were trained by senior employees and junior employees who were called didn’t work in different departments. Overall, I believe they are attempting to use the low occupancy excuse to get rid of the old staff. It’s a shame that a hotel brand like this treats employees like this. I wouldn’t recommend working here. In all honesty, if you do decide to work here, please don’t work hard. They won’t appreciate you! They make one holiday party (after the holidays) and have prizes. In this holiday party, almost half the prizes go to managers. Managers have their own holiday party so I don’t know why they even participate in these prizes, I believe it’s selfish. Also, prizes are distributed between employees"
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1efsse2o5bfgm800,5.0,1.i like this company.they seem nice people
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1efnoipe3q31i800,1.0,"I worked for the Embassy for a year and a half and the only redeeming quality they offer to employees is benefits. You get PTO, 401k, and discounts on all Hilton properties. Other than that, the money was poor. I worked in their restaurant and would rarely make over $20 a shift. The management was EXTREMELY unprofessional. One manager was having an affair with a server and that server would never have to work, but still get paid. They would be gone together for hours at a time, leaving the rest of the staff to do all the work...and we shared tips. When staff brought the problem up to HR, they said nothing could be done without proof. Another staff member recorded a video of them kissing in the parking lot during work hours, showed it to HR and still nothing was done. The bartenders get drunk on the job and get angry with each other. You also have to work 365 days a year, that includes Thanksgiving and Christmas."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1efmujqh8bfgm800,2.0,Successful hotel with very poor local leadership and support. Staff is fantastic as well as corporate support but continuous roadblocks through GM and AGM.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1efkensivol7u800,4.0,"Overall my experience as a server in the dining establishment within the hotel was enjoyable. There were times where management really had a hands off approach with us that caused stress between employees - however, it was overall a good environment."

Desperate to fill those roles as soon as possible, they hired a grip of inexperienced people for their position. Out of every business I have worked for in my career, this management team is by far the worst I have worked for. The restaurant manager gets stressed very easily and takes out her frustration by yelling at her staff and micro-managing her servers. One time while I was taking a customer's order, the restaurant manager (2nd week on her job) came up to my table furiously and raised her voice at me to hurry up and get another table's food out. Any time there was a customer concern about the food or a mess-up, bringing this up to the Head Chef meant you would be subject to the Chef's wrath as she gets offended by any sort of customer complaint or criticism. Just absolutely inept management. Management is very cliquey. Dreaded going into work by my second year. Great job if you need flexibility for school, but for other looking for a steady serving or bartending job, you are better off anywhere else. Bartenders also make nearly 3x the amount of money that servers here make."

He was inexperienced with a big hotel, but we gave him a chance and as time went on, the hotel began to change and not for the good. Lunch breaks were nonexistent for some employees and when i asked the head of HR the legalities of it, I was told that it is suggested, but we are not entitled to a break. The shift consisted of working minimum 8.5 hours if not more depending on the capacity the hotel was in. Going to the restroom was stressful as it is a one man position and the lack of cross training did not help to relieve of us of our position so we had to hold it in a lot. Once again, going to HR was useless as she would laugh and act shocked, but even with being informed, she did nothing to talk to management to try and help us out a bit more. She would see how hungry we would be or doing the dance because we had to go to the restroom yet she would grab her coffee and go back to her office."

There was always a clearly defined goals for the shift and the work was spread out evenly between the department employees. Unfortunately, during the period I was employed our department manager was clearly unhappy with his job and was incredibly rude to customers and other employees. I worked in the banquet department and since the customers had already paid for their banquet hall, their food and the service before we were ever to encounter them, I guess the manager felt like it was unnecessary to listen to special requests or questions coming from the customers the day of their event or after the event had started."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1ds8vp003brcl803,1.0,This place was a joke. To begin with no one knew how to do anything. The controller of the hotel had never worked in a hotel before and only got the job because of a family member. Then HR was at the favor of management not anyone else. This is a terrible franchised property. A lot of of very suspicious things happened here. They retaliate if you decide to give two weeks. Corporate is a joke .

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1ds0edgp8h3kh802,1.0,I strongly advice not to work at Embassy suites Rosemont. The management is terrible. Favoritsm is always an issue and at this place there is no such thing as open door policy. Every employee is treated as disposable and will cover the real reason as to why an employee decided to seek a job elsewhere. The general manager has no back bone and will not help instead give anything to guest especially when they are in the wrong to avoid low scores
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1drp1dsit24e9003,5.0,very great place to work.you really get the feeling that managment cares about you and your well being along with the work that you are asked to do. they would never ask you to do something they would not do themselves.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1drnl86ik24e9003,2.0,"I worked here for about a year maybe and it was probably the worst place I’ve ever worked at. Some events, they’ll have bars depending if it was paid to have one or not. And because of that, when there is a bar set up, you will find supervisors/captains just drinking on the job. No matter how many times you report it to hr or how many PEOPLE report it, not one thing is ever done about it. It is a very negative environment. Of course you’ll have your good days with coworkers, but for the most part, no one cares and this department will drain you physically, mentally, and emotionally. I only stayed because money was very needed in life at the moment."

Most are operated by small or mid-sized hotel management companies who often make unrealistic promises to owners re: profitability.  These same management companies offer very little in the way of competitive benefits, especially healthcare and 401K.  The work environment can be quite unstable, and in some cases even volatile.  The only real advantage to working in a franchised property would be to gain skills and experience that could be leveraged to gain a position in a hotel that is owned and/or managed by Hilton."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dpa46m63h3ho802,4.0,"When the hotel changed sales managers to hourly, we were required to work a longer work week to get the same pay as when we were salaried.  It hurt morale. Management was very nice and not demanding."

In my 4 to 5 months there I started as a sous chef only making $14 an hour. Then put me in charge when they fired the other guy but never paid me more then $14. After 3 months of doing it for that price. They hired someone else behind my back.

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dou8rtfdh45i802,3.0,"When i first began, it was a good job until the general manager was replaced. He was inexperienced with a big hotel, but we gave him a chance and as time went on, the hotel began to change and not for the good. Lunch breaks were nonexistent for some employees and when i asked the head of HR the legalities of it, I was told that it is suggested, but we are not entitled to a break. The shift consisted of working minimum 8.5 hours if not more depending on the capacity the hotel was in. Going to the restroom was stressful as it is a one man position and the lack of cross training did not help to relieve of us of our position so we had to hold it in a lot. Once again, going to HR was useless as she would laugh and act shocked, but even with being informed, she did nothing to talk to management to try and help us out a bit more. She would see how hungry we would be or doing the dance because we had to go to the restroom yet she would grab her coffee and go back to her office."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dmpgc4pgb85r806,1.0,The reason this property has a high turnover is because of management. Meaning The GM and the Front desk Manager .They don’t care about the employees. The job is easy. You are not properly trained. You will learn everything on your own and from your own mistakes you make. Morale is horrible. The GM talks through the Front desk manager. The FD Manager is worst to deal with.

As in any hotel there are always staff changes for various reasons.  Over the years General Managers have worked their way through the system, yet the hotel with its Loyal staff have remained and made the Embassy a great place for folks to stay.  A couple months ago, a new General Manager came onboard.  The saying it’s her way or the highway starting going around the hotel. You as an employee now were not allowed to converse with fellow employees.  You may be talking about the GM.  Long story short, the firing started, and the loyals starting leaving.  Folks as myself, that have been there for close to 6 years, put our two weeks notices in."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dkaopqrn24fq000,1.0,"... It's the staff as well. Never have I worked in a place with such quick turn around. During my tenure, there were a total of 6 housemen hired/fired/rehired. Mainly due to their pay rate being the lowest in town by far. If you applied anywhere in the hotel's sister buildings you'd minimum be earning a dollar more an hour. You are subject to the management never syncing up (because they're also quitting left and right). The hotel is famous for pulling in massive revenue but they have to be reminded that tenured employees deserve a share in the success via a pay rate increase of even 25 cents annually would suffice, but that does not happen here. There is no incentive to perform well because no one is ever held accountable for their actions. Multiple times paychecks are not given on time, on a few occasions I've had to *demand* my check in order to pay my bills on time as they'd have you wait until they're good and ready to pay you. They do not promote from within, so do not approach the business thinking you're advancing your career in any way. Lastly, the staff is subject to dirty work conditions and regular complaints about the cleanliness of the establishment have done nothing to change any practices so there are fruit flies among others commonly present as a result."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dk9b4p39b85o800,5.0,"It has been an honor to work with so many great people. I have been given an opportunity to advance and grow in my hotel career, and all of my managers have been supportive and eager for my advancement."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dk3hb1u5h3og802,1.0,Terrible workplace . The manager is so bad person she don’t care any problem . All employees are unhappy and also the housekeeping cleaning most 35 room or more . Extremely overwork and anybody can don’t more that 8 hours. If you do 15 minutes o 20 minutes more. The housekeeper manager clear the hours and she fix them that ilegal . Nobody say nothing because most don’t have legal documents to work .
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dk32dsti5j63802,4.0,"Days come and go there and it an easy job to master. Cleaning here and there, assisting the guests and all. The workers there are your family who takes time out of their day to help all that are open to receiving help and or advice. Being here I've learned quite a lot about the best customer experience and how to achieve giving outstanding services to everyone walking through those doors. Being there and seeing the smiles I bring to people, the workers as well, always motivates me to throw the best I have at everyone."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dk189ghc24fq002,1.0,I dreaded going into work everyday. Everyone in there hates life. Management is basically non exhistant. I personally wouldn't recommend this place for anybody to work at.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dju6u74m24es000,3.0,Management needs to be tweaked other then that loved working there. Management has their favorites and they will work u to death if ur a good worker they will utilize u to there benefit.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1djrv5j7nh3hn801,3.0,Work is stressful.. no training for most positions. Overall management was terrible. Guests are always held to a higher standard than any employee. When Atrium management took over people lost hours and got double the work load. Bad morale all around.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1djqi0u1o24gj000,5.0,It was a good place to work. Fast paced very busy property the Galleria in Houston. The property stays sold out most of the time with a lot of business Travelers during the week and families on the weekend.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1djpnpg5d5j5v802,1.0,"The worse management I have ever experienced in my life. They don't hire people and expect you to work by yourself on rush hours in a business area. I rarely ever took my breaks because I would be by myself or with a new employee that did not know how to do things, because there was no one to train them properly. No to mention that I had a harassment situation and HR clearly did nothing about it because the man kept freaking me out during my shift. Also they will fire you for no good reason, and make it look like it was your fault. It happened to 3 employees in less than 4 month."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dj7bo43th3n0800,1.0,"To start off you're playing every role as a front desk agent and you're not getting paid to do so. When everyone leaves you have to do their jobs housekeeping, laundry, maintenance, and management, you must do all of these job descriptions under the agreement of getting paid 10.50 an hour. There is no work life balance while working here. You can work 7 days straight and no one cares, as long as your Front desk manager does not have to come in. Their training is horrible and the manager does not know what hes doing. To sum it all up the job and its extra stress is not worth the pay. Also the pay is not negotiable and your standing on your feet for an entire 8 hour shift with only a 30 minute break, they do not allow 15 minute breaks."

Not having the support within the role was very stressful. Upper management is clueless to the operations of the Louisville Downtown Embassy property. Hilton itself is a great company to work for. Amazing perks, and good people who care. You DO not get a Sous chef in the Executive chef position here. The restaurant doesn’t see much business in the local market. Be prepared to DO IT ALL ALONE in this role!! Even asking for help you DO NOT get it!!  You would think the F&B manager would know the BOH Operations etc. they do not.

Most days you are still trying to complete rooms at 7 or 8 p.m.I also spent many hours lugging 60 gallon garbage bags of linens I had to go fetch myself up 9 or 10 floors. The service elevator will also eat up a big chunk of your day. The G.M. only seems to be concerned with rubbing elbows with important guests, other guests and employees don't count. This place needsnew management and a major upgrade"
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dgq1hdq2h44v800,1.0,"Company culture at Embassy suites in Naperville is to reward bad behavior.  The ownership is truly concerned about customer service but they place the recruiting and hiring in the hands of the Director of corporate sales. This leads to a very high turnover of general managers. Due to the lack of structure and stability unsatisfied and disengaged employees provide worse customer service which has a ripple effect on your reputation and customer loyalty. The overall guests experience at Embassy is one that is lacking in communication and professionalism. This hotel is a beautiful, newer hotel in a wonderful area. Take some time to examine and investigate into a more efficient hiring process. A typical day is witnessing department managers point the finger at each other rather than find a solution."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dfgijpu70mch000,3.0,"I liked my job as a food server but after the boss saw that I was quick. she decided to make me assistant in the kitchen, I cooked part of the breakfast. it was buffet so when I took out the food to the restaurant and filled out everything, I had to help at the tables and fill everything out side too. but then she started to giving me more work, preparing the bread, cooking cookies, preparing desserts, salads, decorating dishes. She also told me that the other women did not want to help her to take the coffee to the meetings room. On the other hand, i had  to set up the tables for the meetings rooms,  lifting very heavy chairs and tables, doing banquet. also, l had to fix the delivery in the refrigerator,  frizzer and the dry room. when the time of breakfast was over for the guest. my co- workers were sitting taking their breakfast but i was scare to take mine because she always was mad if i try to take a break. in addition, before i could go home i had to  clean the restaurant and refill everything  too for the next day. for 9 dollars an hour. one day I got sick of a very strong pain in my feet, I went to the hospital, they gave me three days of rest because I had muscle spasm . even thougth i called my boss to let her know about my  situation and i had doctor's paper,she gave me a warning when i showed up. if they give me one more opportunity to work there, i try again, becuase that person is not working there any more. thanks God"

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1df9086ehh423800,4.0,Embassy Suites has been a good place to work. I enjoy the team that I work with in Lincoln. The hours can be unpredictable since banquets relies on events hosted at the hotel. I have had good experience working with management when needing to request days off. Banquet servers get to eat food during most of the events that we help with. The hotel employee discount is also a nice feature.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1df8g1qqob832800,1.0,I was promised full-time but given part-time that was borderline full-time JUST so they wouldn't have to provide benefits for me.

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1de5nqjtn52u8800,5.0,"Everyone is all smiles for themselves and the guests. Any toxic behavior is removed. I like how relaxed and laid back everyone is.

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1ddvm1upih3kl800,1.0,"These people could care less about you. Never give any raises, deduct time employess worked from checks so they dont have to pay us as much and can put that money in their own pockets. They will have you lying to your guests and basically stealing money from them. The rooms are trashy and dirty. . Looks like the 80s."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1ddtvhal5b88o800,1.0,This place is disgusting... I had to leave early due to me being sick. Tired calling serval times to let them know what was going on and no one answered... then I get a text! Asking for the uniform shirt back... not even to see if I was ok what happened nothing. I told them it’s convenient to ask for a shirt back and text but when I was trying to call someone to tell them what’s going on no answer... I think you do too much for little pay not even 40 hours a week.. make you rush with everything... there was cockroach in the rooms... and the guest drinking cups never washed just rinse and put back... definitely wouldn’t recommend
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1ddrmdt425nde800,5.0,Loved every part of the hotel and conference center business. People were great to work with. Projects were always collaborative as needed. Tons of opportunities to work in other departments to grow your career goals.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1ddp91flo24f4000,2.0,"Not a good place to work if your looking for a career or benefits, definitely a job for college students or part time work. Constant overturn of employees and management, very stressful place to work with little support from management."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1ddl6cgge5n8h800,3.0,The jobs was good just management have no respect for the employee and talk down to them. I enjoyed the job not the way it was being managed. I enjoyed meeting the customers.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1ddjoolct24e0002,1.0,"I've worked here for a while, and it was terrible! If i was sick, i couldn't leave. I had to stay and keep in mind, i worked with food. Manager was super passive agressive, many baristas were left alone to either open or close the store, it was not good. Also, had to pay for food, and the food provided was lackluster. Most of the time, I had to go through an 8 hour shift with NO BREAKS?! The manager was not helpful. The shift supervisor, she was great."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1ddh3lafmh438800,4.0,"Great company to work for especially if you see yourself in moving up in the business. You are able to work with an great team that tends to work together, and provide great service for guest both old and new."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1ddagkcb0h438800,1.0,Management is horrible and the housekeeping director is unprofessional and does not know her job. She is also intimidated by new hire Supervisors and will try to sabotage you until you quit and the  housekeeping department is operated poorly and you end up working long 12 hr days due to the hotel not having a service elevator for employees. Supervisors start shift at 11am and don’t leave until 9pm because staff never have supplies to start their work.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dd850mosb854800,4.0,Working at embassy suites was fun. My only down fall was the hours. Not enough hours for at the time of a single mother.... Supervisors and head bosses were easy to get a hold of.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dd3lmdm9b878800,3.0,"Working at Embassy suites is okay. Work life dominates the majority of my time. Being a large scale corporation owed by hilton, working in the front office as a guest service agent, promotions and sales techniques are constantly forced upon us to push to guests checking into the hotel. There seems to be a large disconnect between management and floor workers. False sense of enthusiasm is often demonstrated when management is trying to push promotions to generate any extra revenue possible, I guess it is not always the most genuine enthusiasm. I often requested to work morning shifts 7-3:30pm (Strictly scheduled night shifts 3-11:30pm) but in my 8 months in working this job only was scheduled a handful on morning/day shifts. This was especially disappointing because I had worked 4 different jobs at this same location (including current job) over three years and still felt like I was not valued as an employee and could not simply request to work a few morning a week. This especially effected my personal life not being able to see family and friends due to being scheduled only nights the large majority of my time at this company."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dcvjfn38h3lt800,2.0,"Many language barriers that made it hard to communicate with the kitchen, housekeeping, and guest services, many many times payroll was behind on checks and my hours were incorrect almost every pay period, it would take two weeks to straighten out one check for a new one to arrive and its incorrect as well, high stress because the goal was to make the guest happy but not being able to communicate with your team made it very hard"
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dcsd4einh3ts800,5.0,Always updating and striving to be the best. You feel valued as an employee there. On going training to provide the best customer service. Flexible on hours and great employee benefits.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dcrunuqoh3q4800,3.0,Mixed demographic capture being an airport property. Sister property was across the street and ran as an efficient hotel while Embassy Suites was more of an after thought to GM's and owners.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dcnlqr5gh3hu802,3.0,Not a bad place to work for temp employment. Pretty easy job but the hours are not that good in the off season. In the summer hours are better but the job gets 2 times as hectic and stressfull.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dcn3rmep5nea800,4.0,"Cost constraints and archaic management styles make work sometimes challenging but the people are amazing and make it worth it.

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dckjuvugh3q1800,1.0,Some of the people who worked there were very rude. Couldn’t get time off due to a new policy but would give others what they requested. Don’t really recommend working with them.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dci1auneh3lq800,3.0,"It's alright. Need to be there late a lot. It's mostly manual labor. Some good managers and some that aren't so good. They, for the most part, are very fair though. It's a decent part-time job if you need some extra cash. The sales team does not book many rooms in the summer. They do a lot during the fall through spring time, so get a different job or pick up a second job in the summer no matter what they tell you."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dcghdelih3q1800,5.0,during my time at this hotel I got to learn to master my abilitys in the kitchen and got to meet some amazing people. the only downside was that there can me some miss communication between the staff and right before I left there was even more people leaving after me

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dbt1pl1l0mcn000,3.0,"The work was hard, fast paced, and demanding. You were expected to do all jobs, the schedule wasn't set, shift time varied from a 3 hour shift to 14+ hours, and the work was almost seasonal. During busy times you could work for weeks without days off, during slow times you could go weeks without being scheduled. People frequently worked while injured or sick because PTO was scarce and it was expected for you to forgo breaks and meals. Management as a whole was alright, and I will say they were willing to work with me on school related things, but other than that it was garbage. This kind of work destroys your body, your sleep schedule, and your soul."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dbqch4q924fp000,4.0,"I absolutely loved working at Embassy, until I was moved to a different department. I applied for a job that I really wanted, but was told I wasn't qualified enough to work in that position. I was then offered a position for a job that is even more complex then the position that I had originally applied for. I was thrown into tis position not knowing much, I was just given things to do instead of being trained on what things to do. If, I would have been given more guidance and been in a positive environment I would not have chosen to leave the hotel. I hope that they update the way that they mange the employees below them or else they wont be able to keep any one long term."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1dbl5cttk24f9000,4.0,I was in the Sales Department. Great team of sales managers that work together and communicate often. Management cares! Healthy work environment.

Employees/associates are great, easy to work with but management? Unbearable, unorganized, unprofessional and lack of providing help or training on Front Desk system; meaning they don’t know what they’re doing most of the time when checking in and out guests, more works for us and mistakes are made. They don’t respect your days off, or your availability hours."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1db8i16ha5ne2800,4.0,This job was good in the beginning and then it turned bad when we started to lose or leadership as well as hire lazy people. It made it harder for the people who worked hard because that person would just get more work.

I felt like some of the work I did was unfair, and no matter how hard I tried, it still wasn’t good enough. I felt like I only got hired so it can look like they have diversity in their department. The Hotel is a disgrace and is very raggedy, not to mention the housekeepers have really bad body odor, and they don’t change the top blankets and that’s very disgusting. Once I was finally gone my boss kept texting my phone and I felt like I was being harassed. I would NOT recommend this position to anyone. Theirs way better maintenance jobs out there.

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1d7vr13a524f5000,5.0,"A typical day at Embassy Suites consist of a big turn over with two hundred checking in and/ or out. Guest are expecting upon arrival for accommodations with his or her suite to be given prior to departure time of the existing guest. The presidency of an effective plan on recommendation what the guest can do in the meantime with the exception of early room availability is crucial. Moments that are conundrum are with guest that simply are never satisfied. One of the highlights of the workplace is over time a support team is formulated. It makes working for Embassy Suites a force to reckon with. One key that is taken from the experience would be leadership (management) take pride in assisting colleagues, effectively. To survive hospitality takes reading body language, projecting a smile in your verbiage as well as showing a physical smile and showing sincerity. Working with colleagues from all walks of life is an eye opener. Their point of view because of their culture can be misunderstood, but with patience and attempts to educate yourself you have compassion and see how much more beautiful the workplace is with diversity."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1d4jegfddbrct800,2.0,I was in Housekeeping and it was ridiculous. You get paid by how many rooms you clean. You are also expected to clean the room all by yourself which is harder than it sounds. I was pregnant at the time and when I had to clean the rooms it was ridiculous.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1d4jc3rhrakd3800,3.0,"Is a good company to work but the management is not supporting very well when you need support in your needs. Also, the location for me was difficult because I live in Berwyn and Deerfield is far away from my residence."

Everyone there had already gotten comfortable with their job. And management just let thing happen because they also have been there along time. People come in and leave at the same time each day no matter how busy the hotel was functioning. Hotel really needed alot of cleaning attention, Engineers came and went during the time I was employeed there."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1d2q5noqp1d06000,2.0,"Many nice/good people work here, that would be the best I can share. Hilton Hotel quality, no. Before applying read the Yelp reviews and take notice of how often they are looking to hire many different positions. You will hear constant upset /negative feedback from guest on room conditions, lack of service, so many things not working, and the big issue of not being able to control the temp. in rooms, as the hotel decides if heater is on or air conditioning, both are not able to be run at same time. Perk of ""free lunch"" is sometimes acceptable food served to day shift, evening very limited choices and not able to order during busy kitchen times. And, you bring or buy your own soda or drink, not provided during meal or breaks."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1d2og3pnp0mt6000,3.0,"Hotel maintenance workers are well-rounded helpers who offer preventative maintenance and repairs to all areas of the hotel, including its exterior, heating and cooling systems, plumbing, electrical systems, floors, walls and furniture. They have the skills to use a variety of equipment and the ability to work a physically demanding role that can demand on-call work to handle emergencies. Since this career requires a wide repair and maintenance background with varied duties each day, working in hotel maintenance can be a good fit if you are a jack-of-all-trades and like doing different tasks each day on the job."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1d2066485ak5h800,1.0,"The management at my location was by far one of the worst I've ever encountered. This hotel had a change in ownership, but the staff didn't change. Month to month, their scores were well below a 50%, and never seemed to care what people were saying. This place either needs to get taken over by Hilton, or needs to shut down. It's a gorgeous hotel, that's why it's called ""The Castle"", but they expect someone who had only been there a week to change every single problem they've had. Since I've left, the GM, DOS, and several hourly employees have left their positions, the GM having just walked out to never be seen again. Most staff didn't seem to have any sense of urgency or care for customer service."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1d1n9db1pas17800,3.0,Overall Embassy is an above average brand with great amenities provided to their guests and should be commended for giving great value. They balance this great guest experience with an overall good working atmosphere where an individual is allowed to express themselves to an extent and work together with others toward a like-minded goal: great customer service.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1d1hes6ad5n94800,4.0,This company has a relaxed policy and is focused on customers experience. While employed there my manager at the time was very flexible and helpful when it came to me and my family.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1d1hanf0aak57801,2.0,It would have been a great place to work at if it wasn't for management.. The rumors are horrible they play favouritism and people were quitting left and right.. They always promise more help for the employess but that was always a lie.. The hours were never steady and everyone else's work fell on you that you never get credit for.. Breaks were not given sometimes and managers were barely there unless there was a problem..
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1d1gvg5k3akd3800,4.0,The people are very nice and amazing to work with. But it is very hard to advance at this hotel unless you have worked there for 10 + years it seems like. If you are looking for a place to grow this may not be the job for you.

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1d16p12llb85f800,3.0,Embassy Suites is good place to work. I'm was anticipating a higher volume of guests on average. The hardest part of the job was getting off and not being able to eat on a daily basis because no discount was offered to employees.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1d0uu1pclbrdb800,5.0,"These ratings are for PHM Management and not Embassy Suites Arcadia.  PHM Management has a great team and is a pleasure to work with.

I  related the work to like being in High School.  I was very busy in High school. (  Football, Swim Team,  Varsity Club,  Marching Band, helped Student Council when I could, )   So Like that you wear many Hats at the Hotel.  I  was at Embassy Suites for 14 years."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1d0n22jpl0mcv000,4.0,"When I had to do my internship to graduate, I chose this place and to say that it was good is an understatement. The team that works here work very synchronized and help you clear the doubts that you might need for a task, which makes you feel like you're kind of part of the family. The management of the kitchen is really good, everyone has a part to do to make the day at work run smooth. The hardest part of the job is then a customer or party group cancels or changes  something at the very last minute and we have to think of a way to use or make whatever it is that the customer wants or didn't want. The most enjoyable part of work is when you finish a very important or big ask as a group and everything is a success."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1d0ijhtgrb80h800,3.0,"It was a very busy bar.  The Hotel was understaffed which made the job a lot more difficult than necessary.

I learned how to deal with people, make quick decisions, follow through with requests, work through the OnQ system, and perform refunds and financial transactions. The management was fair and had an open door policy. The culture was very fast paced and stressful. The hardest part was dealing with complaints while the property was under construction and the low staff. The most enjoyable part was being able to solve problems and assist the guests through the most difficult work days."

I had proof and I still didn’t get my money back. Rumors were spread, the management was poor... good work is overlooked. Never got breaks, management didn’t care. People were fired for stupid reasons but when someone breaks the code of conduct it’s just a slap on the wrist. Embassy suites are a great hotel but this actual location is terrible."

The hotel is falling apart. The hotel is filthy.  The hotel smells. The hotel is dated. The managers on property could care less about how poorly the hotel runs as long as they can get by. The managers think that they can keep bankers hours.  Every single manager on that property needs to be terminated.

I enjoyed most bout the job is the co-workers and the amazing team they have."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1cu0rhqrnaqj8800,4.0,"I've been working here for a couple months now. The work can be fast paced some days, and extremely slow other days.

I learned that no matter how much you work hard to advanced it does not matter because if you have kids that will for sure keep you from getting that promotion. The hardest part of the job is having a manager who doesn't know his job but continues to leave his team hanging. My co-workers are who and why I continue to go back every day without them I would have quit a long time ago.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1ctdqqnvo1d0l000,2.0,Lot of issues with property paying bills yet they spend thousands of dollars for a pointless fence around the property.

As far as advancement went, it was largely political and based upon your relationship with management, less to do with work ethic. On the positive side due to the size of the property ideas and initiatives were typically easy to implement, and individuals have more autonomy to make and carry out decisions."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1cfb3g050brdicg8,2.0,As stated in my title this place was a very dysfunctional environment. There was never a set crew. People quit the front desk constantly because of poor management and their lack of organization and just basic common sense. There was a lot of friends of mangers being hired as supervisors and other positions with zero skills or awareness of people in general. No one could advance because they only chose to hire outside the company instead of promoting the hard workers who actually chose to stick it out with the company.

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1cccspomaak8rd7l,1.0,"I worked at Embassy suites for about 8 months and got nothing but a near minimum wage and a lot of disrespect. Front desk and upper management bully the housekeeping department and have unrealistic expectations. Many employees have a grudge with each other and the atmosphere was toxic, if management didn't like you they would find a way to get rid of you. Everything was on a personal level and the lobby attendants do all the work without extra pay. HR did not help when employees tried to pick fights with me and people ended up getting framed. They put the guests second and money first which causes conflicts with their expectations within the workplace. It's the worst job I've ever had in my life and you can take that coming from a former construction worker."

And when all the guests leave you get free breakfeast. And while the tips are nice, they’re inconsistent; combined with minimum wage, it’s just not enough. And when you start working with temps, you have to stay longer than you should to pick up their slack. The head chef berates you about things that are not in your control. It’s gotten to the point where I’m afraid of asking for so much as a pay check without him chewing me out. It should not be this way. Recently I’ve been accused of not finishing my work before I leave when I know for a fact that I did. My indirect supervisor should be telling me what I need to get done that not part of the norm, but she’s not. So now I’ve taken the blame for my supervisor not telling me what needs to be done.

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1bsj81t0vakel82v,5.0,"Often management will compliment and thank you for a job well done. Very understanding as well. This is the best job I have had before. Your day to day in this position is mostly the same most of the time. You will have the same responsibilities each day but sometimes have extra work to complete. You are responsible to bring guests whatever they request in a timely manner. The days where you get a lot of calls are the only days where the job gets somewhat stressful, otherwise, it is mainly stress-free."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1bsahrm33akaudiu,4.0,"Some days can be fairly laid back where we only have to worry about set up while others can be a bit more high stress where we have set up and banquet services. Management can be easy to work with and get along great with the employees. The most difficult aspect of the job can be when we have to do set up and dinner service. I do enjoy when we have slower, laid back days where we can just listen to music and do our job without feeling rushed to prepare for a dinner serice."

My GM and DM, however, left A LOT to be desired (however, keep in mind, this was 2009/2010) so management has probably changed since then.  The property was/is gorgeous and has a lot of opportunity for profit.  I even helped set up the rooms which gave all of us a chance to get to know each other (from housekeeping/engineering/front desk and management offices).  It was a unique opportunity for me but with my husband returning from a tour overseas and my own challenges with management, it was a short lived employment.

They insist that you only get one weekend off each month. They put you on a flex schedule with 3 days notice of schedule and then call you and tell you to stay home that morning before you come in. Or they will call you in on your day off and then switch days with you.  The workers work very hard to please the customers and get little praise from their hard work from the company. Customers will leave notes  saying thank you.

Pay no attention to any other department except your own. Come in ready to work, take pride in your job. Everyone has worked for someone, or came from another property or is someones family member, one way or the other. If you are consistent and reliable, then you will get the hours. Maintain professionalism at all times, be willing to go the extra mile, check in with your bosses daily and before you leave. In the long run you will be rewarded.

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1bkv9s27v52t4dco,1.0,A typical work shift started at 8:30 through the week and on the weekends it was the same or luckily 9:00. You started by loading your carts and getting your boards to clean for the day. You would have about 10-15 checkouts and maybe 3 stayovers. The hardest part of the job was the management.  It's a buddy buddy system and they try to big brain you. You receive your pay late and the lack of communication about is not stagnant. The Asst. GM thinks she is Queen B and barely there to discuss anything.  And as far as teamwork (sighs)... the girls wanted to help but management would not allow it at all.. It's alot of strenuous work and you get a fifteen min break and just maaayybeeee a lunch. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone but I understand the struggle so you sometimes you have to do what u gotta do to feed the family.

I learned how to treat every guest with respect and to cater to their needs. I've gained a surplus amount of customer service skills during my time at Embassy Suites. Work environment went from being a team to split sides that always had tension.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1bcqtm4a3b85o94k,5.0,I enjoyed working here. My co-workers were amazing. My management team were great. But when Human resources fired me over someone stalking me that was the last straw for me..

Very hard to run a hotel while undergoing management change and renovations. Was told there would be good tip money, sadly mistaken. Little pay and hard work by the pool. And never even got a uniform. Was told by many hotel guests that the quality of the hotel was going downward every year.  Would not recommend to most."
Embassy Suites by Hilton,1bcnr1uhqak5b90h,1.0,No opportunity for advancement. Constant disorganization which causes hostility. Teamwork is non existant. Was promised advancement that is yet to happen.

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1bbpij18haqgn926,4.0,It's probably no better or worse than any other similar job. The only difference being that the dramas of the work place shift from location to location. The job is by no means difficult and you can make a pretty decent amount of cash if you are a tip worker. They have regular customers that come through that either own or work for big companies hosting large groups and you get to know them as regulars and it makes the job less random. It's good to know what a guest likes and how to provide for them as opposed to having to guess the new trend every day.

The employees are extremely hardworking and shows how loyal they are to the hotel and the brand, each day. However, due to issues with the hotel itself a typical work day, is very hard and stressful. You do have more lows than highs. Staff is greatly unappreciated by management.  Management is awful, unqualified for their positions, and treats staff poorly. With that being said about management, you'll quickly learn how to step up to any challenge, learn how to take initiative, and develop management skills; due to the lack of management actually doing their jobs.  Also the pay isn't great. The lowest paid hotel in the area."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1b5c1j0vhb8aibd1,4.0,"During my employment at this location, I experience many great moments. Schedule was flexible, we were always busy, the company has some great benefits, but the only down side was the management part. During my stay we went through many managers, each new one came in with its own ideas and working style. By the time we were getting used to some new ideas and concepts, a new manager would come along. Not being consistent was reflecting on bad reviews from customers."

They only take the word of the manager without doing a thorough investigation.  This job has its favorites, no matter how much of a good worker you are.  The employees work well with each other (we were like family).  This company including upper management used to be so caring: they went from sweet to sour with the change of upper managers."

Front desk staff, the first line of encounter, is a world class team, without exception, as are the catering staff. There is nothing fake or contrived about their hospitality, they are genuinely good people who didn't learn hospitality from training films or manuals. Do yourself a favor and go work there, you will be a better person for the experience. I can't say enough good things about this hotel."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1aqv6fk5takaoe5k,2.0,"The Embassy Suites in Montgomery is not a good place to work at. Most of the people who work there don't stay long. They can't get nobody to stay either they quit or they are fired. Embassy Suites in Montgomery is quick to fire you (I didn't get fired). The management is horrible. You shouldn't have to keep telling the management multiple times that you are being mistreated and nothing gets done about it. It's not just HR's responsibility. It's how they do stuff which isn't right. There's certain people there they mess up one time and they get fired and others they mess up plenty of times and it takes forever to fire them. Some of the management including supervisors don't know how to treat people (ex: telling lies). The breakfast setup is disorganized it makes no sense to have only 3 or 4 people and the hotel is full house. Guests and other people were complaining They hire people but they won't stay, they walk out and never return. 2 people are needed on the breakfast line to cook the omelets. The dishwashing situation is not good. If it's very busy you need at least 2 or 3 dishwashers to help get things done faster. They can't expect 1 dishwasher to be in 3 areas all at once. Supplies run out quickly during the busy times. It's very disorganized. If somebody would've warned me about how the Embassy Suites in Montgomery was I would've never took a job working there. I learned I need to communicate and not put up with nobody b.s. I liked the hotel guest but the worst part of the job was how the Embassy Suites does things and then they wonder why they can't get nobody to stay."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1ag3kas1t5ncne0o,4.0,"Embassy Suites is a great work place. The only thing is they have employees here that don't make enough to make ends meet for all the work they give their workers. Working 6 nights a week on 7.75 is not good for the body or peoples Job Work/Life Balance. Management here honestly only cares about the department they are in and don't address all things with their employees to make the employees better at making a difference in the hotel. Overall it is a great work place, just too much to deal with when it comes down to a life balance and having bills to pay with no rest from a low paying job."

One day, I decided to make a change. Embassy Suites gave me the opportunity to grow more as an individual, as I'd been stuck in a rut for what seemed like a long time. A mere few months has gone by since I started.  I'm more relaxed and more financially stable than I have been in a long time.  Working and staying here, you're surrounded by wonderful people who will always go out of their way to make sure everything is running smoothly for you. Whether a fellow employee, or a Guest, they will have your back!"

My one con of the experience would have to be that once I conquered the challenge of adjusting to the working life, there was no real mountain to climb. My day to day was mostly the same, with a handful of bored, monotonous hours to fill. The management team was great though, and made a point of coming out of the offices to include the clerks in their conversations and ask our opinions on things. I felt useful and valued. Hilton has high standards for service, and I feel fortunate that my first work experience was with a company of such high standards. My personal standards have been very much informed by my experiences with them."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1a59r4i3bas179um,4.0,I like working alone so the job itself was a great fit for me. However the only downfall is the people in the back of the house are typically non-English speaking individuals. So that being said trying to communicate and ask questions was very challenging. I find myself having to repeat things five times before the message is understood. Also the training period isn't the greatest at all. They give you only four days to learn everything! Also my trainer was very rude and overbearing. Hovering over me while I clean and just overall being a pest.

I'm saying it as someone who knows what it really feels like to put in so much work & not gain anything from it. I don't like the fact that they only give us 30 mins to complete a room.

I myself work there for many, many years and during those years worked with hundreds of employees, some better than the best, but most of all, a great experience in the people business and the servicing of others. In my position I got a chance, to change people lives for the better, with the help of the other managers and team members alike and yes, the GM too. You will never find a better group of co-workers, who go out of their way to take care of the guest and support the staff, their fellow team members. I learned a lot working at the Embassy Suites, earned lot's of life time friends, learned a lot about myself, learned how to be a better person, to myself and others. There were some difficult time and some challenging times to work through, but we succeeded in the end. Though we are one, of a many great hotels in the new and ever improving Nashville, we stand out because of our dedication to service. For me, the stand-out team members are the hard working Housekeeping  and the Guest Services departments, they are the front line troops, also you will never find a nicer group of guys than those in Engineering, I can call them all my friends. Food and Beverage and the Kitchen staff come in everyday with the intention of getting it right for each and every guest they serve. I could not have worked for a better group of people.

Embassy Suites by Hilton,18f61lvcc5ncg8ne,4.0,"I worked at Embassy suites full-time and part-time for a little over 8 years in all areas of the Food and Beverage Department. I started in 2005 in the Coffee/Gift Shop and then advanced to the restaurant where I was a hostess and a server. When I turned 21, I began training behind the bar and quickly became one of the fastest and hard working bartender there. Even though we went through managers roughly two times every year, the management was decent. I absolutely adored my co-workers and still communicate with most of them to this day! With the economy falling year by year, the hotel narrowed the amount of employees constantly. The last six months that I was an employee at the hotel, there were seven of us who ran the main bar, complimentary bar, restaurant, and room service seven days a week. I enjoyed all aspects of the job which is why I remained there for 8 years, however the last year when I was part-time, needing a day off for school or anything was unacceptable."

I learned how to greet and deal with guests in an enjoyable manner.  Sometimes, there was uncertainty among the valets about how management wanted us to accomplish certain tasks.  For instance, if we ran out of spots to park guest's cars, some valets would not know what to do next.

She was truly one of my idols and I looked up to her with the utmost respect. I started out as a Room Attendant and within 1 year was supervising the public space attendants on second shift. I also inspected rooms and oversaw the laundry functions. This employer really cares about their employees and their families. The senior management (especially the GM) was the best, most supportive team I've ever worked for. I would recommend this company to anyone that likes to work at an amazingly fun, upscale hotel and spa."

Although my co-workers and I were overwhelmed with the work load, we had a great time finishing our work together strong.

Embassy Suites by Hilton,18b6f7j09ak4gbda,2.0,No two days are a like at work. Guest change and the turnover rate at work is high so the employees change almost as much as the guest. The only thing that remains constant is the daily checklist that all employees are mandated to complete. My co- workers often look to me for help and guidance. What I learned from my management is how to stick together. With new management coming in and out of the company it is up to the employees to unite to get the daily task done and teach new employees. The hardest part of my job is dealing with lack of communication between departments and unorganization. The most enjoyable part of my job is pleasing the guest.
Embassy Suites by Hilton,18b2o41aoak4g8l5,3.0,"I beieve that the Embassy would have been a greater place to work if the management believed and trusted in their employees.Their true concern was that of the guest and not with their employees,as with any hotel you have to please your staff ,unhappy employees make unhappy guest for guest can see through fake employees."

Embassy Suites by Hilton,18a3dfs98ak4gap2,3.0,"The people that I met and worked with were amazing. The property itself is old, dated and ownership is doing whatever they can to not spend any money. We tried to make the best of it and I truly believe people kept coming back for the people. Upper management is unrealistic in their expectation that a four hour customer service class will fix deep underlying issues with the building. My direct superior was a complete micro manager that does not know how to coach people and basically just threathens their jobs. I truly feel sorry for the people left behind under him because even other department heads were wondering why he still has a job. I would probably recommend the company to other people but I would caution them about upper management. I personally got dumped because I would not conform to his way of running things even though I clearly showed him it was not working."

Management was very trusting towards me.  A different serving experience for me.  I miss this restaurant and wish to find employment so enjoyable again.  My co-workers were great, as well.  I was treated with respect and we never had a bad day, that was great.  I know the hardest part was simply looking back.

The one thing that doesnt change is my drive to make sure all of my guests are taken care of.  Both hotels have taught me so much about customer service and about people in general.  I would have never learned learned these skills if I didn't get to expieience them first hand and have the guidence of management to improve upon my skills.  The best part of hospitality job in the hotel business is that anyone person that works at the hotel has the ability to make a difference for our guests!

Since most customers pay to the room, dealing with money is not typical. Since the payment is cut out, the environment is more fast paced. The customers order and you give them the food and receipt. There are times when checking on them is necessary but the general feeling of the place is quick and with little conversation. The other half of the restaurant was typical, where people order drinks/appetizers and then food. Conversation is a large part of the restaurant. Management was great, kind and consistent."

The hardest part about the job was the job itself, it was never an easy job but as long as you stayed focused and apply what you learned, then you'll do fine"
Embassy Suites by Hilton,18042p7jf5n8gfni,1.0,"This is the WORST hotel!!  If you like stress, I would encourage you to apply here!  The management staff is the worst I've seen in my sixteen years in the hotel industry.  Problems are not resolved, the building is run down and it leaks inside the hotel whenever it rains.  Guests should expect to be able to enter their rooms at least 1-2 hours after check in time.  There is no organization and the lack of communication between departments is very evident.  If you have problems or concerns. please do not expect any help from the HR department or any other manager for that matter.  And when you complain about mistreatment, expect to find another job because they will find the least little excuse to terminate your employment.  The entry level staff members, on the other hand, are some of the best in the business!  They go out of their way to make sure the guests are satisfied, all this even with the conditions of this hotel and the small wages that are paid.  The one thing I will definitely miss about this hotel are the wonderful staff members I got to work with everyday.  I will also miss some of the frequent guests of this hotel.  They made coming to work a little bit more pleasurable!"

I stand the the front desk, greeting each guest that enters the hotel, I answer the phone, along with transfer calls. I make reservations, check guest in and out of the hotel, I inform them of the amenities that we have to offer and let them know that if they need anything, they can ask me and always give them my name, i do so with every guest. The best part about it, I get the opportunity to meet with guest from all over the world and here a bit about where they are from. I love making conversations with the guest and hearing about their travels. The hardest part would be that we are responsible for the phones and all the guest, sometimes we have 100 guest checking in and the phones won't stop ringing, with only two people working, we can't always pay attention to the phone, since the guest in our presence is more important. I do love my job along with all my co-workers, it is a great work environment, however, I feel it is time for me to explore my options."

The managers work close with the suitekeepers to get rooms turned over properly and quickly. The job itself isn't hard at all. The most enjoyable part of the day is when we are all seting up our carts congregating and laughing about of off days and nights  before. We even laugh and joke with our managerial staff.

Embassy Suites by Hilton,1776kmbj45dsgc81,3.0,A normal work week for me is Sunday thru Thursday. I was hired to work during our corporate guest stays. I learn a lot of their food orders and preferences in order to make them feel comfortable during their stay. Many of them return quite often throughout the year and I find it easy to get to know them on a personal level. I work with only a few other co-workers during the evening shift. We all have our own roles and help each other out if needed. There is normally one manager at night to oversee the operations of the entire hotel. The hardest part of my job is getting off at 11pm because I am a single mother and I pick my daughter up from the sitter that late.

I feel looking back on it, our management team, we could have advertised in the downtown area a little better than we did, which to me was a harder challenge than I anticipated to attract new patrons into becoming regular customers. An enjoyment that I received was the challenge of using the delegation that was bestowed upon me and allowing the team to be apart of the decision making process.

Overall, the company will let you be mediocre because the business structure doesn't demand excellence. You get what you put into your work, getting the experience that you want really depends on which team you happen to be placed in. Once you are in a team, it is almost impossible to move unless it is something serious like personal/team conflicts, harassment...etc. Compensation is below the market. Turnover is quite high because the people, who are actually want to be great and work hard, don't get the guidance to grow or the opportunities or compensations, therefore, we don't want to stay."

IHS Markit,1f0mg84q9n54g800,3.0,This is an extremely large company that has good opportunities for advancement but transparency from upper management is not good. Work life balance is decent but pay raises are minimal. Get what you can going in.
IHS Markit,1ev2lqpmtn55l800,5.0,"My experience at IHS Markit was incredible.  From day 1 they made me feel welcome, appreciated and valued.

IHS Markit,1eutf16c2npjs800,1.0,"IHS Markit has been managed as not much more than a balance sheet for some time now. Frequent layoffs. If you are looking at product or sales roles, just make sure they are within a business that is performing well."
IHS Markit,1eu476pnbo1fo800,4.0,"IHS Markit is a good entry-level job that will provide experience on your resume. However, you will have to learn any additional industry skills on your personal time, as their training is only on their proprietary software."

IHS Markit,1ep69jti0u32a800,3.0,"International company, nice to work with colleagues from all over the globe. Good work/life/balance with good effort to engage people in fundraising for charities and luncheon and happy hour events for employees to stay connected to each other. Most people have been there for a long time, more than 10 years. Many budget cuts and ownership turnovers prevent employees from feeling good about their longevity at the company."
IHS Markit,1em64hudvu1nm800,4.0,"IHS Markit is a great organization to be part of.  Most of the leadership cares and is in tune with the needs of their employees.  It is also important to know that this is a publicly traded company and is very large so all of the common good/bad factors are present.  There will be layoffs, hiring freezes, and bureaucracy.  However the pay and benefits are good and they do invest in their employees."

IHS Markit,1elccerlcnpcn800,2.0,"I hated every announcement by corporate management and the toadies below them. I don’t know of anyone that believed them. I liked the people I worked with, but we pretty much had the same negative view about the company in general. Our division was purchased by IHSM; previously, it had been a really good place to work. But IHSM ruined it. I’m glad I could get out; everyone was happy for me and envious at the same time. Almost all were looking for another job outside the company."
IHS Markit,1ejvlnvhhs7ds800,4.0,"Good culture very fair, transparent and went out of their way to be very inclusive and diverse long before that was a corporate trend. However, I was not a fan of the ""hot desking"" situation in their NYC office, but other than that it was a very nice modern office in a great location."
IHS Markit,1ejgbr294sa3p800,2.0,Not much room for growth and development due to management being ineffective in implementing a system which promotes career progression. Each team is siloed making it hard to learn anything outside your team operations.
IHS Markit,1ejd574mcu3pf800,4.0,Depending on what group you're in the work can be engaging and interesting however promotions are scarce and pay can be much better. Some management is great and others are a little sketchy and play favorites. Health benefits are decent but better at other employers and compensation should be more with the amount of work and responsibilities given in some cases. But work/life balance is pretty good and flexibility to work remotely is a plus.

IHS Markit,1e06e3h98307n002,1.0,"IHS is set up with Directors that act as owners of a company.   They rule completely.   The technical directors are judged on how well they make sure the work is completed that make customers happy.  The product people who deal with the customer call the shots.   The environment is one like a consultant firm.   There's not much you can do to improve things technically unless the customer  is paying for it, which they don't.   You'll work with many systems written in the early 2000's with no hope of modernizing them."
IHS Markit,1e063cq9g307m002,4.0,IHS Markit has a portfolio of over 100 technology solutions and data sets. This provides employees with an opportunity to sell both internal and external channels. There is also a lot of opportunity from lateral movement among various teams.

Its not a youthful energetic group of people. There is no sense of team work or fulfillment. If you are ok with sitting at a desk all day with nothing but 2-3 tasks, then this is the place for you. If you aren't interested in growing and learning and are ok with covering reception when receptionist don't feel like it, then this is the place for you."
IHS Markit,1dtmtuca433nc004,3.0,"Very relaxed company as long as you're not in an operational role.  They have such low salaries that they make up for it with the year-end bonuses, so if you're considering leaving it's in your benefit to stay until the bonus is paid out.

Company organizes lot of training classes for professional and personal development. IHS Markit gives access to Linkedin Learning and Get Abstract, 2 great tools I truly enjoyed having access to. Talking to colleagues and customers was the most enjoyable part of my job. Lot of flexibility to work remote or flex your hours. There is a healthy work life balance. Health insurance provided was very good !"
IHS Markit,1dntjlfn0h3h3804,2.0,"Working at IHS was a good experience overall. Free meals were a great benefit as well. I was not very happy with the management handled the project I was working on. He gave a lot of workload and told me that the work had to be completed in a few days. When me and my other coworkers stayed overtime, he only thanked 2 other people.  He also claimed to address him if there are any questions and then he would have a ""I'm better than you"" kind of attitude when he answered it. He mostly  helped those who he considered favorites to him. He also held meetings for the people he considered his favorites and taught them more training. I was really dissatisfied by this because even though we all had the same position, some were given more training and respect. If you are thinking of working for this company, please double check and make sure that you would be a good fit before you accept it."
IHS Markit,1dmp3bf4mh3gu802,4.0,Started out great with room to grow. Later job security became a problem. The lack of communication was bad.  Alot of micro managing.  Alot of layoffs.
IHS Markit,1dm6gfvq252tr804,1.0,"If a manager throws out an idea, the minions snap to without anyone questioning does this make sense? Worth the time?

IHS Markit,1dio32u25h46t800,4.0,"Great for work life balance and benefits. The nature of the business keeps one engaged especially in a support role where you may support several lines of business that afford an opportunity to learn different industries. In most situations there is a level of autonomy which for me was what I needed. This is good for individuals like myself but in some cases made it challenging as not everyone is self directed and when you relied on someone that wasn't self directed project work and completion suffered.  Ambiguty is constant and things change frequently so If you like a constant state of consistency and normalcy, this company isn't necessarily for you. (I personally love change). Learning the business and the matrix environment can feel a little overwhelming at first but once it starts to click it is really an interesting and rewarding dynamic of the organization. I would recommend this company to driven, flexible, and curious individuals who love to learn and grow."
IHS Markit,1dff55d5r24e1002,3.0,The location I work at has a good atmosphere. You are not really trained you learn as you go.  The is little or no room for advancement and need to be self-motivated.
IHS Markit,1dfekp2q00mch000,2.0,Hire the right people with experience rather than trying to low-ball everyone. Management training is a joke. Stop lying to candidates just to get them in the door. Hire some helpful HR employees. Stop trying to spread the HQ between offices.
IHS Markit,1df6vmhc5h41u800,4.0,Enjoyable place to work. I left due to there not being an adequate pay raise for the increase of my responsibilities. Also they hired a manager above me that had no experience in the role and was somewhat ineffective in their management style.

Once you are in a team, it is almost impossible to move unless it is something serious like personal/team conflicts, harassment...etc. Compensation is below the market. Turnover is quite high because the people, who are actually want to be great and work hard, don't get the guidance to grow or the opportunities or compensations, therefore, we don't want to stay."

IHS Markit,1d21chs65akdd800,3.0,"IHS Markit was a good job, lots of changes due to the merger with Markit.  IHS Markit gave me many opportunities to grow and learn in a positive environment."
IHS Markit,1d1uuuvhhakd7800,2.0,i worked here for almost 2 years and it was the WORST JOB
IHS Markit,1d1kk0p9cakh1800,3.0,I did not enjoy working here that much. I found that the work was repetitive and that much of the work was not of much value to the clients on the GMI side of things.
IHS Markit,1d17jus8eakgr800,3.0,"Busy, not enough resources, no advancement, empty promises, good maternity leave, manager was flexible could work from home, leadership team didnt fight for promotions for employees"
IHS Markit,1d0r1ruodb89b800,4.0,"Driven by acquisitions and internal innovation, the company is breaking grounds to serve clients across industries and exhibit as a technology leader. Fresh grads can find tons of opportunities to grow at the company. However, the firm doesn't seem to have a good process to retain talents in the long run."
IHS Markit,1d02qc0tr0mtf000,3.0,"IHS Markit gave me the opportunity to advance my career, develop my skill set in product management and sales, and build my global network. Great culture and work-life balance"
IHS Markit,1cvf72ge11ahe000,1.0,There are some legitimately good people at the company. They are actively attempting to improve the culture of the company.
IHS Markit,1cvconhjdb80h800,4.0,"Each team worked great within themselves. The trouble was communicating with the other teams, and especially remote folks."
IHS Markit,1cv1de5na0mcm000,4.0,"Coming into work, you start your day reviewing emails sent from the day before and analyze the deals that need adjustments for the day.  You will also be spending the morning contacting certain parties if adjustment to your deals are needed.  The rest of the day is spent taking on new trades, analyzing rates, and closing trades for clients."
IHS Markit,1cu4gmaq20mtn000,3.0,Love the fellow co-workers and the direct bosses but the higher ups only seem to care about the stock price and how to make themselves look better in the eyes of the board.
IHS Markit,1ctbpctnjakip800,3.0,Good Place to work. No Growth within the organization.
IHS Markit,1csh7f9hvak7k800,3.0,"There are many 20 year old legacy systems being maintained, but there are also efforts to migrate into cloud/container deployments and continuous delivery pipelines, with build, test, and deployment automation. A large Change Advisory Board monitors all deployments, so there are no daily/hourly pushes to production."
IHS Markit,1cs4glpekaqil800,5.0,IHS Markit was a great place to be  part of for as long as I was due to a very smart and intelligent culture that helped you learn everyday.  Management was always encouraging and allowed senior level team members the authority to make decisions and trusted us with our workload.  I truly enjoyed the aspect of using data in almost every decision I had to make and how successful we were at making changes because of it.
IHS Markit,1cq3taa80ak6j800,4.0,"My day to day tasks would change multiple times in the month. While at the company I learned multiple skills and softwares to help my career. I was able to learn Adobe Acrobat, Excel Marcos and formulas, Photoshop and Kodak software as well as how to maintain  an inventory database. In the time that I worked there I basically had a new manager every year. Either the manger was let go for various reasons or they left for a better opportunity. This made growth in the company very difficult. They always had a change in staff which made the day to day work very difficult. Constantly having to train new people or train them on new tasks for the day. I did enjoy the ability to work for various contractors. The benefit to changing tasks constantly was that I was able to learn a lot of different skills that helped me in other business opportunities."
IHS Markit,1cq1sv6sraqhs800,5.0,Working at IHS is great. Most everyone there has been there for a quite some time. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Competitive pay with great benefits.

IHS Markit,1coohj1aqakha800,3.0,A typical day would start with responding to the client's request for data for specific wells or areas.  Would continue with cataloging the new data and refiling of data that had been returned by the client.
IHS Markit,1cnrmj8r4akh2cun,4.0,"Relaxed atmosphere in the Dallas office allows you to be able to have an enjoyable place to work.  I enjoy the work/life balance and the transparency from our executive management.  The biggest thing I wish was difference is to have more challenging projects available to work and promotion opportunities.  Also, I wish our management in the Dallas office was more open and transparent.  I feel that my biggest concern could be mitigated if I knew more about upcoming projects."
IHS Markit,1e22h9qd7hcau802,3.0,"It is a laid back place, people are nice but there is no pressure to be better. Mobility between teams is virtually nonexistent, a ton of legacy/in house products. Managers are useless, all talk no actions, left-hand doesn't know what right-hand doing so ended up being really inefficient in many departments.

IHS Markit,1clfpo5l21ahs15p,5.0,"I worked in an area of delivery that dealt with the oil and gas industry, the Healthcare Industry, the shipping industry, technology, economics, information about aircraft industry, and on and on."
IHS Markit,1clff9h67ak8rfrv,2.0,"No movement for advancement. Little managerial guidance, no directional guidance, low communication, workplace culture difficult, good benefits, not a good fit"
IHS Markit,1ckgdb0vk5ncj8us,4.0,"Great place to develop out of college. Great leadership, management, and culture at the company. Fast-paced, challenging environment that provides all the tools to advance your career. Gives amazing exposure to C-level management at some of the biggest companies in the world."
IHS Markit,1cj487hdhakgu9uf,3.0,Lays off long time employees and replaces them with Temp workers at a very low pay scale.  Most employees I know have never been promoted or given a raise in the last 4 years.
IHS Markit,1cikpv46paqgpa4n,5.0,"Have to have your numbers up everyday . Which means you have to scan at least a 1,000 pages or more a day but it’s pretty cool and relaxed working there"
IHS Markit,1cid45olcas0savs,3.0,"I worked independently.  My day would consume pooling research lead tickets, revoiew the information requested by the cliets, and getting back to the client in a resanable time period."
IHS Markit,1ci3g4v8dakcnd9o,3.0,My work at this place for very short term. But within that short term period i enjoyed learning new things and working on it collectively with a team.
IHS Markit,1cgfo9fjb1d0i3h9,4.0,"I worked at IHS before the merged with Markit. The job itself was ok it was mostly dealing with phone calls and directing tickets to the correct response teams to fix end user issues. But the management was kicked around a few times before it settled and the vision was lost. I think the biggest factor was that we were promised more bodies in the head office but they shipped the positions overseas, which lead being difficult to take any real time off, or being able to take a lunch without worrying about something breaking and being the only one to watch the alerts. Overall the experience was good and I learned a lot in the time I was there."
IHS Markit,1cgf680b10mcj2fm,4.0,I loved my job and the people I worked with.  It was a changing culture following the merger but I believe most people rose above the challenges and continued to work hard.
IHS Markit,1cg5t4p0fak8kc07,5.0,Work-life Balance is good at IHS.
IHS Markit,1cfv6cv10b84lcj2,3.0,Large data company still trying to adjust to their broad expanse of locations throughout the world.
IHS Markit,1cfnvlqel1ahi6sg,2.0,"A recent integration with another company has lead to many challenges but management and employees remain committed to working towards mutually beneficial resolutions that promote a team environment and a legacy of customer delight. The culture is relaxed and friendly but with a high degree of professionalism and a philosophy of being transparent in its communications to the customers, employees, the financial markets, the media and the public at large."
IHS Markit,1cf7tgsbdas1ccd2,4.0,"Stress free working environment. Work and family life balance is great. Salary is mid range, and not that attractive. The company needs to invest in the career growth of younger employees-as they are the future of the company."
IHS Markit,1ce4mnfe5b80pcaj,3.0,"I was hired right out of college, great first job as an operations analyst. I loved the high paced work environment. I was promoted to a specialized team to work with highly sensitive clients. However, even though it meant more, high level work, there was no pay raise even at the year end review. They need to pay workers for their quality. Otherwise, turnover will continue to be high."
IHS Markit,1cdv74steas0pbfi,2.0,"It's a stable job, which is about the best thing going for it."
IHS Markit,1cdj7rqvqb84j8cu,5.0,no review offered.  I don't want to say anything positive or negative  that will reflect on my future prospects for advancement with IHS or any other company.
IHS Markit,1cd5sliph1agu34q,3.0,good to advance your career but doesnt invest in employee growth or retention.
IHS Markit,1ccluv9mj5n908ru,4.0,A solid place to begin working at to grow your resume and within some teams have a long and prosperous career. Benefits are about average that you would find in the marketplace and salary is competitive to average depending on role.
IHS Markit,1cc4f6hpeakgp8vd,1.0,"Hours are ok but no career path.  It's hectic and toxic and non-appreciative.  I'd say no one is safe but lets be fair - those chosen few are very safe even if they do nothing but ask others for updates and them submit up as if they actually did something, the rest are expendable. Management is reactive, culture is toxic"

IHS Markit,1cburs9rmakgn8hd,1.0,"Overall the work environment seemed to be good.  However, depending on the team/desk you are part of, it can and will be disastrous.  For instance, one previous evaluator left the firm prior to my start because team leader was horrible.  I was told the previous evaluator made it very clear that the team leader was ineffective managing the team.  From my own experience, that same team leader had assigned various tasks to senior members and then re-assigned it to me.  The team leader makes it very clear that he plays favoritism, was horrible at relaying directions and would change evaluating and pricing methodologies during our team meetings, while making it clear to us not to speak of the change outside the group nor to the sales team.  The entire team was very clear of their dislike of the team leader when he was not around, including the senior members. Senior members have also told me their dislike for the team leader due to his lack of promoting even though they have been part of the team for over 5 years."
IHS Markit,1cbpq2c9c5n8q9pq,4.0,"Laid back usually, either very busy or not at all. Management is good. Supposedly the benefits are good if you are full time, but as a contract worker, I can't be sure."
IHS Markit,1cb3mkvr8ak4jc08,5.0,"I loved the challenges that I was allowed to accomplish. The management allowed me to grow in my styles and knowledge, knowing that whatever was asked would be accomplished."
IHS Markit,1cao49c0k1agv1jc,3.0,The company is not as bad but compensation is not great. Job culture is alright. The management still need more training about because people quit very easily.
IHS Markit,1cahkvu0kb890bl4,3.0,"Good culture, opportunities to learn, good team structure, not the most transparent, growth opportunities, relatively decent compensation, average work life balance"
IHS Markit,1ca3ihl4v1agt0u9,3.0,"Despite the repetitiveness of the job, the culture allowed you to explore other things. The business always seemed to be up for sale and made the future a little cloudy. The co-workers made the experience worth the sacrifice."
IHS Markit,1c9p6250p5j7qcbr,3.0,Great place to learn and acquire knowledge which you can take with you throughout your career.  Teams work great together and some of management can be very helpful when asking questions.
IHS Markit,1c9huv7lr0mt51h7,3.0,"Low pay, low opportunity for advancement. Very relaxed work environment. Nice people. Learned some really cool things that you wouldn't learn in any other job due to the uniqueness of the role. Overall, Nashville is expensive and you will not be getting paid much."
IHS Markit,1c9g5tbnjakjpc7l,3.0,"IHS Markit is a great place to work, but has its shortcomings. Remote work is available in some circumstances and management is understanding of external life. Career advancement is not well-defined, which is likely due to restructuring after the recent merger. Promotions and salary increases are heavily dependent on department success as opposed to being based mainly on personal merit."
IHS Markit,1c8iotnrf1ah60pt,2.0,Are you looking for an employer that doesn't care about you? How about low wages and no hope for advancement? Then IHS Markit is for you! They will treat you like the peasant you are while they ensure the shareholder are kept happy.
IHS Markit,1c8c692n4brfpfsl,3.0,As the years went by the company has gotten worse. It is not a fun place to work anymore. The management has gotten worse. To much favortism. The workload has gotten overwhelming
IHS Markit,1c83hlup952vob3k,3.0,"Overall, I would recommend Ipreo to anyone looking for a job in the Financial Services Sector. Ipreo also offered one of the most amazing benefits package I had ever seen. The company is broken up into different teams that offer different services or products. Unfortuantley for me, I got stuck with a bad team. I experienced disrespectful managing practices and an extremely stressful and toxic work environment."
IHS Markit,1c81v2e0lak7ofrd,2.0,"The one saving grace about working at IHS markit is the fact that you have a semi-flexible start time. Sometime between 8:30 and 9:15 or so. Workplace culture is pretty bad and getting worse due to incompetent managers, lack of compensation increases, taking away of benefits, raises that don't even cover the healthcare cost increases."
IHS Markit,1c7hlf5n0aqja8u8,4.0,"The culture at the Dallas office is very relaxed but with that comes the responsibility of being a self starter in some areas of job duties. Management is approachable and open to discussions and in most areas, colleagues are collaborative to complete tasks."

IHS Markit,1c6obctfnakiuahe,3.0,Great work life balance and laid back. It's a nice plac e to work at if you arent looking for cutting technology and a laid back environment. The people are cool and a good culture
IHS Markit,1c6j6m099akerd71,2.0,"If you enjoy being constantly reorganized, fearing lay-offs on a bimonthly basis, and disagreeing with most upper management decisions, IHS Markit is the company for you.   Terrible health benefits to boot.   People are generally nice, at least."
IHS Markit,1c6g0kercakbcdmn,2.0,My particular group did not have a great culture.  Very high attrition over the 6+ years I have been there.  Most other groups appear to have much lower attrition and more enjoyable culture and work environment.

IHS Markit,1c5pk10d1akajb1h,4.0,"The typical day can be quite stressful, however I am paid fairly for overtime and have opportunities to let off steam and some points during the day. Great place to get a foot in the door. Would recommend to anyone in finance/accounting."
IHS Markit,1c5kiml0laqi88li,2.0,"Work life balance is great; however, employees are not compensated very well. Poor management team. Management has to spend more time to invest in employees."

IHS Markit,1c52trbn3ak6590n,3.0,"Huge, behemoth of a company, comically focused on high level corporate metrics that 99% of employees have very little opportunity to impact. The overall vision and mission of the company are difficult to identify, or to see in your day to day."
IHS Markit,1c4vja85qak5te7u,2.0,"Put in your time and leave quickly.  Distraught mgmt team and very messing M&A activity.  Not sure why they cant get with the program.  Poor bonuses, put in your time and move up and out as quick as possible."
IHS Markit,1c4ndbpkrakdld06,3.0,Software is somewhat dated and company is attempting to advance their technology.  Middle management doesn't always have your best interest.  There's a lot of internal and external collaboration.
IHS Markit,1c4le200l5ndkaqp,4.0,"IHS Markit has been an excellent place to get experience and work within the Finance community. The work/life balance is what you make it -- either direction. The upward mobility is there if you put in the work, but it can be slow to sync between actual responsibilities and compensated responsibilities."
IHS Markit,1c4k4v9scak5ta08,2.0,Be very aggressive in what you want to learn/skills you want to build. Then take it and leave for pay that'll match those skills. If you show initiative and perform well you'll be able to build those necessary skills. It's casual dress which is nice and they offer lunch but if you're even remotely healthy the lunches aren't good for you.  Management is very unorganized and can't agree on most things therefore you have to make your own path if you want to move up.
IHS Markit,1c4ip33i852todlk,3.0,"Some of the products are out of date and the product team barely has the resources to improve them in a timely manner. A lot of entry to mid level employees work some weekends and after-hours. Clients in the investment banking industry are rude and couldn't care less about your work-life balance. I've spent many PTO days emailing back and forth all day, handling things because other people on the team couldn't handle them."
IHS Markit,1c4iav5j7akdl85l,3.0,"Great place to work, unless a merger occurs.  Focus on development of employees was very good.  Compensation was very good.  Great people to work with.  I would recommend highly."
IHS Markit,1c4dvati2b89nagn,2.0,My immediate manager is a clear thinker with an understanding of business.  Upper management became top-heavy.  We lost almost all out programmers because there were no sales for an entire year.  Mobile programming was treated as a leisure service.
IHS Markit,1c4bd5ffbaqhkavg,5.0,This job is fairly sensitive and not lot of people can be working in this field ..there is attachment to the patients there has to be trust between the patient and you

IHS Markit,1c3bov3v1ak50dvh,3.0,"Long, expected hours. Some areas for collaboration. Too many acquisitions to have a clear focus on the growth products. Much of the culture is outlined vs. organically grown."
IHS Markit,1c2b8gcjs5j4qd22,4.0,"nice place to work at. relaxed but when it gets crazy, forget about it. some managers don't know why are they working there!! decision are made according to the budget not according to the need"
IHS Markit,1c23cgqa2akgrf6i,3.0,Cons
IHS Markit,1c1b5o7sgakcg959,2.0,"This company presents themselves very well in the market and many clients think highly of them. However, their management solely focuses on numbers and sales figures and cares little about their employees.  Their salary is good so if you are confident working under a very stressful environment, this maybe for you.  You need to work and check your devices late at night, early mornings and on off days in order to keep up with the work load."
IHS Markit,1c081vi9lbrd49gh,4.0,It is a great place to work although the pay is not what it should be although the company is very flexible and really cares about your work and life balance.

IHS Markit,1bvnppsqab80pb5d,3.0,Entry level positions have little room for growth and advancement within the company. The management at this level is also poor. The amount of work does not match the pay. The only good thing is that there is a pretty fair work life balance.
IHS Markit,1buuas1bl1d072jb,3.0,"Great time off benefits but unless you work in a major office, good luck being given the ""benefits"" they tell you that you are eligible for. Also, the new CEO is making a lot of drastic changes."
IHS Markit,1bue5clhs5nfi880,5.0,"During my time at IHS Markit I was tasked with data analysis and modeling. Management and benefits were great. Lots of communication among all employees at all levels. Trying to change things takes a long time, but the company is open to anything to improve its services"
IHS Markit,1bucac9f7ak97a72,3.0,The company is still laying off employees and adding extra work to the already thin workforce. With the new CEO coming into the company at the end of this year it is clear he wants more lay offs.
IHS Markit,1btsi80cfaqguerj,3.0,"The company has changed quite a bit over the past few years. There is a significant lack of career growth and development for employees, and little to no work/life balance. Due to recent re-organization and re-structuring, roles have significantly expanded, demanding for work, that used to be done by a team of 3-5 people to be accomplished by a single person.  Whole teams that are accomplishing significant amounts of work, have not seen any raises, or cost of living increases in anywhere from 2-4 years."
IHS Markit,1btnmiketak4pakd,4.0,"Very relaxed. Can wear Tshirt and jeans everyday. Great benefits, Healthcare, 401K 5% match, 15 days paid time off and 3 personal. Lunch is catered mon-thur. Food is always stocked in pantry like cereal, bagels, granola bars, etc. It is a great place to start out working but to further your career the timing can be slow."
IHS Markit,1bt7u2vhjb8bpbj8,5.0,Great company to work with. Mangers are very helpful and support my work. Colleagues are easy to work with and cooperate with on  different projects and duties.

IHS Markit,1bt2nl5r51ahn3io,4.0,The people ar what made the company so great that and the company always seemed to take care of their employees. Beause I am in IT their decision to move to a specific new platform without consulting the people who would be supporting it was a bad one.
IHS Markit,1bs3kvn80akao8i8,5.0,IHSMarkit is a very nice place to work  for with  great benefits  and all the workers are really nice.  I get to be part of a production  team that on daily basis I am driven to earn revenue  for the company and I have fun doing it. I get up in the morning and it feels like I can make a defiance at my job.
IHS Markit,1brpemrhgak6ld84,1.0,Management is not trained in people skills.  Pay is very low for what is expected.  Went through a merger and has been questionable since.  Poor workers are babied and the work they don't do is given to more dedicated workers.
IHS Markit,1br068ke2aka6fsd,4.0,"IHS Markit has a very client focused company culture.  As a result of that, they really try to foster a collaborative work environment that has cross functional teams focused on customer satisfaction.

IHS Markit,1bq39itn2akdnbus,4.0,"I had a really great experience at IHS Markit, including several months after the merger of IHS and Markit. Recently, the company is undergoing some turmoil due to the merger and many positions are being eliminated or relocated out of Colorado, which was formerly its headquarters. Soon, after the restructuring mellows, the company should be a good place to work again."
IHS Markit,1bq1qvpd0as1vb7c,4.0,"IHS Markit is a great place to begin a career. Plenty of opportunity to learn the ropes and the company likes to promote from within. Lot's of proprietary software though, so what you learn and use may only be relevant within."
IHS Markit,1bp9ftb9k52tg89c,3.0,"Excellent company and well managed on the top level. Nevertheless, it is expected that job requirements are met with limited assistance. Teams operate on the lean side with limited resources at disposal. Although this is the case, your ability to work in a fast pace and entrepreneurial environment is tested on a daily basis. In time you develop attributes and abilities that far exceeds your own expectations."
IHS Markit,1bov6b8gfaqheblm,4.0,Innovative and growing company with accessible management team. Young culture with good work/life balance and social opportunities. Good opportunities for learning.
IHS Markit,1boteijd6akh78s8,4.0,"After we were acquired and converted to Agile, our culture became increasingly about metrics and meeting our numbers. If you set a high bar for yourself, you'll stand out, even if you might resent your coworkers who remain employed despite setting a low one. The people are mostly nice (even if they are a little more stressed than they were before the acquisition), the benefits are average (except for the ""High Deductible"" HSA, which is much lower than most companies!), but you can bet the office will always be a ghost town by 5:06 pm every day, which is nice for work life balance. You could do worse, though, and it's not going under anytime soon."
IHS Markit,1boppp14hakh2flo,4.0,Supportive of working from home when needed.  Advancement opportunities for proven employees.  Good accountability.  Data company that is looking for new ways to help clients understand their business and make better decisions.
IHS Markit,1bokqmp5hakd1c26,4.0,"Work is not bad, but pay has never been up to par. The lack of pay causes a ton of turnover which does not help the morale of those who stay. The insurance is great though."
IHS Markit,1e22h9qd7hcau802,3.0,"It is a laid back place, people are nice but there is no pressure to be better. Mobility between teams is virtually nonexistent, a ton of legacy/in house products. Managers are useless, all talk no actions, left-hand doesn't know what right-hand doing so ended up being really inefficient in many departments. Overall, the company will let you be mediocre because the business structure doesn't demand excellence. You get what you put into your work, getting the experience that you want really depends on which team you happen to be placed in. Once you are in a team, it is almost impossible to move unless it is something serious like personal/team conflicts, harassment...etc. Compensation is below the market. Turnover is quite high because the people, who are actually want to be great and work hard, don't get the guidance to grow or the opportunities or compensations, therefore, we don't want to stay."
IHS Markit,1bokbjgi3ak568vi,5.0,Restricted Stock Units for all employees. Fantastic environment to grow your career with a lot of corporate functions running through the Denver office.
IHS Markit,1bo67aucgak8vfo1,5.0,There are lots of opportunities at IHS Markit since these two data giants merged. The CEO has a great vision for the future of this company and has appointed managers to help him carry it out.
IHS Markit,1bnm26o3s1ahq4hq,3.0,"IHS Markit is a culture that requires tremendous time and energy.  The expression, work and play hard truely applies to this firm.  The employees are great to work with, but my recommendation to management is to become better at communication."
IHS Markit,1bnh783li1baa6ar,3.0,"Working for a Global company means that you always have to schedule meetings and work around people located anywhere in the world.  This means you work about 10-12 hours per day - if you don't walk away.  They don't pay very well for the experience they have since they are able to hire 2-3 people in 3rd world countries to do the same work that you're doing, for your same salary."
IHS Markit,1bn6erraeakh5d6g,4.0,"The company benefit, management and job culture are great and the people who work here are very outgoing and professionals. Overall I have enjoyed working for this company even though it was for a short period contract."
IHS Markit,1bmvaqd2i5j56df8,4.0,Many perks was to be able to work from home when especially needed
IHS Markit,1bl14q2gb5j4v8ka,5.0,Very proactive culture but my particular division is a very flat structure- no room for advancement.  The upper management is very focused on individual professional growth.
IHS Markit,1bkq3r6rfakdg91n,3.0,"Young culture, but most leave to pursue other opportunities rather than advancing. Firm has a difficult time retaining talent due to lack of resources."
IHS Markit,1bjtltndoaqh88om,4.0,"This is a great first job to have because there are a ton of really smart people that are willing to help you learn.  The company is also really good about knowledge transfer and training.  They went through a merger a couple of years ago and brought IHS and Markit together into one company.  They were a little too secretive about some of the management decisions they made and I would have appreciated some more transparency in that respect.  They also started cutting back some of the perks we used to have before the merger.  The pay is probably a little below average which is why so many younger people tend to work there.  Lastly, the culture is really awesome!  People are generally very friendly and helpful."
IHS Markit,1bjl2sqhaak95ct6,4.0,"When I started working at IHS Markit it was R.L. Polk.  R.L. Polk was a very well know, established company.  It was family owned and was known for taking excellent care of their employees.  When the Polk family decided to sale the company, we were bought by IHS (Information Handling Services).  One year after the acquisition, we merged with a company out of London called Markit."
IHS Markit,1bhtefaoob88mci5,4.0,"I Thoroughly enjoy working here. There is rarely a dull moment, and so many opportunities for personal growth. One thing to understand about Ipreo is that it is made up of about 30 products. Some of those are older, legacy products and some are more modern. They encompass technologies that range from Silverlight all the way to .Net Core running on Docker images and serving up single page JavaScript apps."
IHS Markit,1bhe5k8655n9ca9v,3.0,"While I appreciate the work/life balance and benefits that come with this large company, the culture in the office is far too corporate. Management is out of touch  with their employees, and communication is severely lacking throughout the company. It's a good place to work for a little while, but job security is also a major issue."
IHS Markit,1bh26g20mas1rb9k,3.0,"As a young professional, this job was great for getting working experience post college. However, the organization itself is just alright, at least from my own personal experience."
IHS Markit,1bgrcc151akdbbu5,4.0,IHS Markit is a good company but there is always the threat of layoffs and re-organizations.  Have to worry when the next one will come and hard to do a good job when you don't know when one is coming.  Very good people and hard working teams.
IHS Markit,1bg945kmn5j4nacl,4.0,"Have always enjoyed my time here, including the work and the people you work with. But there is only so much you can enjoy if you feel you are falling behind with pay scale."
IHS Markit,1bd7l7q335n9ba75,4.0,Great culture and strong management team.
IHS Markit,1bcgaemq85n95d0s,3.0,"I enjoyed working there, but all my teammates except 1 for one team and 2 for another team were located in different locations.  I missed the team comradery!  My typical day included reviewing where the team was at according to JIRA, then leading stand up for each team.  I would lead refinement each day for the opposite teams, except Wed.  After refinement I would follow up on any issues or items that came out of stand up and /or refinement.  I would also follow up on any outstanding blockers or impediments.  I reviewed and followed up on retro items that are in progress and focused on completing any outstanding program level items to implement such as the on-call schedule / process, JIRA migration preparation, etc.  I also attended and led other weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly meetings such as Team Health, Scrum of Scrums, Planning, Retrospective, Demos, Scrum Master Guild, etc."
IHS Markit,1bb9h8cheakgjbog,3.0,"OK place to work, but not stable since the merger.  Shared services and finance jobs being off-shored to India and Asia.  Good location (Energy Corridor) in Houston"
IHS Markit,1baimvpqk1bg654v,4.0,"Although almost every major investment bank uses Ipreo software, I never heard of it before applying.  This company is a leader in its business area and has been growing over the past couple of years as it attacks new opportunities.  It's been a bit chaotic with new people and changing ways of doing things, but now seems more stable and organized."
IHS Markit,1bagcetef0mck0lj,4.0,"Friendly and relaxed atmosphere, mix of very repetitive tasks depending on volume of client documents. Good job to start working fast"

IHS Markit,1ba61stnjaqhsdbo,4.0,Engaged in new eCommerce project that requires integration with many systems. Required new technical learning at a fast space. Great benefits and vacation policy!
IHS Markit,1b9eotkl65nemfe2,4.0,"generally a good place to work but core revenue streams have matured. investment wasnt properly made during the growth period so infrastructure is not in place and is leading to client dissatisfaction. this had led to increased scrutiny on operating teams to cut costs and increase efficiency, but operations were already bootstrapped to a critical level. work-life balance however is quite nice."

IHS Markit,1b3b0f3cr5na7dmb,2.0,Constant re-orgs and 24x7 work schedules cause serious morale problems for the mostly talented and very nice employees. The atmosphere tends to be somewhat oppressive and the expectation is you put your job before family.

IHS Markit,1b24dqbsh1bad1jt,3.0,This is most likely due to a number of recent acquisitions of smaller companies and not enough time to bring people up to date.
IHS Markit,1b21vee525nci97u,1.0,"Poor management, lack of commitment to retaining talent, incompetent immediate leadership, adequate work-life balance, private-equity owned so they count their pennies and expect employees to consistently increase their level of output while holding incentives constant that are minimal to begin with."

IHS Markit,1a0vbrtd0akbcf9e,5.0,"The company is pretty tight knit at the 65 Broadway location.  It is a one floor office with partial cubicles, which helps to build camaraderie among employees.  Bi-weekly teams meetings and monthly floor meetings help to keep employees ""in the loop"" regarding Ipreo's overall business activity.  This is helpful given the fact that it is still a private company and teams get a chance to receive feedback about their contributions to the firm."
IHS Markit,1a0r21ig7ak7c838,4.0,Very open work environment with managers and other executives available. Lots of young people and the company is growing quickly.

IHS Markit,16olnhffo00005s9,3.0,"Markit WSO is a great jumping off point for new graduates or people with not much job experience. The pay is good, the people are young, and the work is not particularly hard. It is easy to get in a rut there, however, as there is not always a place to advance unless you groom yourself for another department. Harsh differences in the culture between Dallas and NYC are starting to create major issues within the company, specifically as it pertains to the Dallas office. Job skills learned are not easily transferrable to other companies as they are specific to the WSO software, although if you are lucky to get the right mentor, you can get industry coaching. Vastly different experiences are had by people who go to work there, so it depends on the fit of the person to their group where they end up."

My manager and mentor have made it very clear that the position is for my benefit and are more than willing to help advance my career within NREL, in academia, or in industry.

Having joined the team during shut-down I feel I am missing out some of the advantages of working here, but I benefit greatly from the flexible scheduling and supportive management."

National Renewable Energy Laboratory,1e7dr1todhcqi800,5.0,"NREL is a great place to work. As a research institution, it requires self-motivation and often expects a certain degree of independence from it staff in order to excel.

National Renewable Energy Laboratory,1e2f5oqhkhbi8803,4.0,NREL is an excellent organization doing cutting-edge R&D.  The work culture is balanced but can include bureaucratic challenges.  NREL provides a great opportunity to make an impact in renewable energy.
National Renewable Energy Laboratory,1e203fjcgouer803,2.0,"If you are a PhD Research Fellow candidate, do not bother applying if you are over 40.  If you are a Staff Engineer candidate, 30 would be the cutoff.  I thought NREL would have a different attitude toward older workers than the private sector but it is just as bad or worse.  You have to be young and well connected to be considered for any position there, which doesn’t always lend itself to the best nor most experienced people.  Outside of a few rockstars, the place was frankly quite unremarkable and disappointing."
National Renewable Energy Laboratory,1e1f61f0t25aa003,5.0,"I worked there only for the summer as an intern. My manager was very helpful as a mentor.

The hardest parts of the job were contributing helpful ideas to a team full of such intelligent people and occasionally realizing that what you have been working on just cannot work.

National Renewable Energy Laboratory,1b8fq9k8r5naebc0,3.0,"This organization has a fabulous mission, a beautiful campus, and relatively good benefits, with a flexible work environment.  NREL hosts thousands of dedicated and talented people, but the executive management team has reduced communication (both channels and information) in the last year following new leadership.  This research engine hosts some of the most sophisticated facilities and capabilities in the world for studying energy efficiency, and if you're a research scientist or engineer, it could be very fun to work here.  However, if you do anything on the business support side of the house, you are held in low esteem.  Project management rigor is virtually nonexistent, resulting in poorly planned and sloppily executed projects.  Business units are now more siloed than ever, and there is little integration between them, resulting in increasing inefficiencies.  Funding is largely from Congress, although there is increasing emphasis on acquiring industrial partnerships."

But you wouldn't know this by working at NREL. Executive management works without regard or consideration to reality. They pursue goals that make no obvious sense.

National Renewable Energy Laboratory,18pc375ioak4gb5l,1.0,"The National Renewable Energy Laboratory protective Force officer job is the classic situation of it  ""Much to do about nothing."" The basic Patrol function is nothing more than checking and rechecking the same locked doors to the same buildings over the course of an 8 to 12 hour shift.  The emergency preparedness procedures are overly detailed and convoluted. This step by step process for things such as fire alarms medical emergencies and HVAC issues is often used as ammunition against security if the slightest thing goes wrong or someone complains about how it was handled even if handled correctly. The communication and dispatch center for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory often doesn't work due to power issues, making it difficult for security personnel to do their jobs. The worst part of the National Renewable Energy Lab protective Force officer position is the security management and supervision. Security supervision will often hideout for several hours expecting the regular security personnel to do all of the work. Security supervision often will not make on the spot supervisory decisions and leave it up to the regular officer to ""Make the Call""  only to be criticized later for making the decision that they made. Often especially during shift change security supervision will argue and yell and sometimes use profanity at the other officers in front of other employees. These arguments were usually about last minute call offs, schedule changes and disagreements on policy and procedures. Sometimes these arguments escalated and almost became physical confrontations.

National Renewable Energy Laboratory,17pluf48jadsg821,4.0,"NREL is an excellent place to learn about the energy industry in a short amount of time.

Most new hires get hired on as contractors or temporary to hire, and there has been a pay increase freeze for the last while, but they are expanding the number of workers on campus. The hours are relatively flexible and the workspace is very nice."
National Renewable Energy Laboratory,17i1sivu9b84gch4,1.0,"This position is with a quasi governmental agency: funding is through DOE and therefore attracts and keeps mostly slackers. Management is paid very well; works very little; screws up often, and blames others routinely. If you work hard you will be made to work even harder...if you don't work hard and cover for your bosses’ poor performance you will be rewarded. Management is not held accountable: bad behavior is rewarded; and, good behavior is punished. Management avoids work at all costs: they push work off onto their staff; they arrive late; they take two hour lunch breaks; they leave early; and, they commission spies to cover their inadequacies. If you try to mention, to their boss, all the inequalities and shenanigans that go on with management - you will be punished. If management makes a grave error they will blame staff. There is nothing staff can do about it as upper management covers for lower management and vise-versa. Management will then systematically give individuals that speak-out or “trouble-makers” poor performance reviews and those individuals will then ultimately leaver or be fired for speaking out. Everyone is so afraid of speaking out and therefore if you rock the boat you will have no allies. Be very careful."

National Renewable Energy Laboratory,172vmpln0adsga96,5.0,"I'm shocked at some of the reviews about NREL here. Fortunately, poor work and poor effort are not rewarded here. As a new employee, the first thing I was told was that they were there to support me in my personal and professional goals and that I should come first. I've never worked in a place with such an employee-oriented environment. The work hours are standard but flexible schedules are encouraged and supported. Managers and Center Directors are involved and encouraging without micromanaging. Relevant, quality research is in no danger of short funding. There is an active and social culture amongst everyone I've come across. Overall, with the frustrations that come along with the research process, and the mangement at NREL, it's my favorite place to have worked. I'm thankful for my employment here and hope to stay for the rest of my career!"

The people for the most part are committed to the organization and the future of renewable technologies. However, because it is a DOE lab, budgets and projects are funded at the whims of congress and DOE. The politics can make it an extremely difficult environment in which to work. Be prepared to fight for the resources and authority to accomplish the goals for which you will be held accountable.

U.S. Department of Commerce,1f47qh6ksu20v800,5.0,Worked in Payroll at the Census office and it was both fun and intense. Hourly pay was good but no benefits or paid time off. Our office was set up like a bull-pen so it was loud and could be difficult to concentrate. This got especially trying during the pandemic as some were resistant to wearing their masks. Most management was supportive though some would sit and bs while other employees were skipping lunch and working OT to get the job done.

U.S. Department of Commerce,1f3sr2objs7ju800,5.0,This was a great place to work . There where constant changes to shift and Department goals.  I was one of 5 supervisors on night/weekend shift.

U.S. Department of Commerce,1f3gpkgnjocr1800,4.0,Great job for some who enjoys learning new things and working with a diverse group of people. The amount of hours you have to work can sometimes exceed ten hours per day but then you get paid overtime if you are a hard work there are opportunities for job advancement but since this is a temporary position it’s not a good fit for everyone
U.S. Department of Commerce,1f2ibp8623h8b000,3.0,Managers hired in offices were unqualified and lacked training. Management didn’t follow through with procedures and favored certain employees over others.

Training can feel grueling at times. Management is very good about staying in the loop and are very open-door policy. Hardest part is the case load by biweekly, you have to get work done (like any other job or get fire) or risk job. Work culture, depends if you want to interface with coworkers you can, if you want to have bare minimum communication and just work you can as well.  Most enjoyable part is the search and office actions. All the work done for the application pays off in this part."
U.S. Department of Commerce,1f1s7vbfht4cq800,2.0,A lot of reading and writing with no critical thinking or problem solving at all. Very boring. Your experience is all determined by how good or bad your supervisor is. Very stressful and depressing place to work at.
U.S. Department of Commerce,1f1lv8chqo15n800,2.0,"You are just a government number and you aren't very visible above your immediate supervisor so promotions are few, especially if you are not a US Veteran.  Pay is below scale but federal government benefits do off set."

U.S. Department of Commerce,1f1930t9cn56c800,3.0,Supervision was like a revolving door.  Interview was a 3 minute phone call.  Sight unseen.  The application was very thorough.

U.S. Department of Commerce,1f01pa16b304v000,5.0,"Worked as an adult numerator for the 2020 Census. Great flexibility with schedule. All work was face to face in the field. Short term assignment of about 10 weeks. Pay was good, paychecks always delayed!"
U.S. Department of Commerce,1evvkqnbst458800,5.0,I thoroughly enjoyed the 14 months that I worked as a field supervisor during the Decennial Census despite it occuring during a once in a lifetime pandemic.
U.S. Department of Commerce,1evse7ebinpn0800,3.0,It was not bad working for the census I enjoyed it. You get to make your own schedule. Not enough training though. Supervisor was a little stuck up and snooty. With proper training I think it would have went well but because of covid there was no classroom training
U.S. Department of Commerce,1evklhbaen52h800,4.0,It had the potential to be a wonderful career move.
U.S. Department of Commerce,1evkf00plsa8h800,5.0,"Working with the 2020 Census, I found the training was thorough, the management was very supportive. Mostly - my assignments were for interviewing households for non response (census questionnaire) follow up. You make your own schedule. Using their latest technology for data capture made the interview process very smooth. I felt challenged and then rewarded when I would complete cases that had been difficult with prior attempts. The goal is to close all cases via in person interviews, for a successful census.  It is that commonality that fuels your ambition to close cases, and builds solid relationships with supervisors. They have your back! The timeline for completion was impacted by COVID, so it was even more important to collect accurate data quickly. You could work as many hours as you want, based on the caseload for your area.  Your pay includes mileage as well as your wage, plus overtime. I’d recommend this work to anyone who likes good, interesting  work for good pay."
U.S. Department of Commerce,1evdbml9en55l800,4.0,"The census is a necessary process that happens every 10 years. I was happy to be apart of it. Unfortunately, 2020 was a nightmare and it was a tough time to go door to door with the pandemic. The time was cut short by several months from extremely hot August to October as opposed to the original time frame of April through October. The political climate didn't help either. I think it would have been a great job any other year. The compensation was good, my manager was great. It was just another 2020 loss."
U.S. Department of Commerce,1evd6ikart5ho800,5.0,US Census Enumerator...I was paid from leaving house. Entire area of SWVA was territory. Much autonomy to complete work. good hourly rate plus mileage reimbursement.
U.S. Department of Commerce,1ev65jpejnpjs800,3.0,"From the training up through the field work, the 2020 US Census was a failure. Perhaps the next one in 10 years will have more success. There will be a different administration in government for sure and hopefully it won't be during a pandemic. The US Chamber of Commerce may be a competent and enjoyable place to work for in normal times, but after this disaster, hard pass!"
U.S. Department of Commerce,1eutp1f5anpna800,4.0,"Once things get to a management level the chaos is too much, for instance my immediate supervisor was fired, her entire team wasn't notified, and her responsibilities weren't taken care of by someone else in the transition."
U.S. Department of Commerce,1eur3isp4u1ki800,4.0,"Due to the Covid restrictions, this was a very demanding job with long hours but the cause was well worth the effort.

U.S. Department of Commerce,1euqnsevg3h8h000,5.0,Your day is already mapped out for you on your GPS. You learn to prepare for the day on the night before.  You pack your bag with all your materials and your device. You must start at a specific time and end your day at a specific time. The rules are very strict about this. If you like obeying the rules then this job is very beneficial for you. There's no work place culture to contend with. No racing through the traffic to get to the office. No worrying about clocking in. You are an independent worker.
U.S. Department of Commerce,1eumb1fnju1ki800,5.0,I thoroughly enjoyed my position as a 2020 Census Enumerator.  The work was very important and I was proud to work for the Department of Commerce to accomplish this work accurately in order to best represent the households that I enumerated.
U.S. Department of Commerce,1eujvrmt6u1ib800,5.0,"Tha funny thing about working the Census, this is my 2nd, is it's fast paced, always requires more than you feel like you have to give, yet,in the end the feeling of gratification when you finish is outstanding.

U.S. Department of Commerce,1eua15od2u1ib800,4.0,"Working for the Census was great, and fun, WITHIN OFFICE. Mangers were very helpful. It was a very flexible position, at times making my own schedule. NO vacation or benefits for seasonal workers but this is similar in most other job."

They had many IT issues and system glitches. But they were all worked out quickly. The. Pay was pretty good but they are very strict on overtime if you log one hour unauthorized overtime you are terminated . so you have to be very careful.

U.S. Department of Commerce,1esc25k3gu418800,5.0,"Good place to work.  Management responded quickly, and was understanding if difficulties were occuring within the staff.  Attempts were made to help getting people employed once the contract came to a close."

The teamwork started no later than 7:00 am  and we didn't finish until the work load was done for the day. I learned how to communicate in the most challenging situations environmentally, weather wise, and personal security wise. Safety is first, second and always third. The culture was work hard/ play later. The hardest part of the job was telling the enumerators that the job was finished. The most enjoyable part of the job? I liked everything about the job."
U.S. Department of Commerce,1er91ojm4u49m800,4.0,"I worked for the Department during the 2020 Census. It was a bit wild as Covid changed things around and hire dates and such were a mess. Once things got going, it was a good job to have for being a temporary position."

They were friendly and authorities the best for us to do the best.  The jobs are not as easy.  We had to face rejection and need to find ways to get people talk.  They also pushed us to work more overtime in the weekend.  The last month we worked almost every day.  We got let go early because the president had the court to stop us.  Thus, he could run the election."
U.S. Department of Commerce,1epd134qnu38g800,3.0,The purpose and reason is awesome. You can develop great teams and cooperation amongst your peers but management  destroy it with their personal vendetta against other members of management

U.S. Department of Commerce,1eothkrm8u44g800,1.0,The people were great to work with. But there is no job security.  Training was absolutely the worst I’ve ever seen. Death by power point and extremely old Computer Based Training Modules.

U.S. Department of Commerce,1enjln227u2d6800,5.0,"Working for the US Census Bureau was a pleasant experience, since every day I learned new things with each interview I conducted with the surveyed families, which gave me a broader vision of the different cultures that inhabit this nation, especially in the Texas state. The most difficult part of my job was when I had to go to houses where the inhabitants were hostile, aggressive and therefore represented a danger to my physical integrity. It was a pleasure and an honor to work and serve this great nation."
U.S. Department of Commerce,1en1l6pfsu3d8800,5.0,Temporary job only. Good pay.  Set your own hours work as many or as little hours as you want. Would have been nice if it was a permanent job. Overall good experience.

U.S. Department of Commerce,1emdisqj1sa3l800,5.0,"Enjoyed freedom and flexibilty to work as often or as quickly as I wanted. Meeting people and ""selling"" completion of the Census forms ""on the fly"" was an interestingly enjoyable experience. Of course one must be cognizant of barriers and resistance people put up, in order to be able to successfully navigate through the caseload.

U.S. Department of Commerce,1ekrocq87o1eg800,1.0,"If tax payers could see how their money is spent and how the data is collected they would be appalled. Management is careless and selfish, no real room for advancement. Policies are often ignored, training not completed. Especially at 3186"
U.S. Department of Commerce,1ekgmh5diu1t7800,5.0,I personally found it rewarding because of the management and how organized I made my work that was given to me.

The hardest part of the whole thing was it was during the pandemic and it was difficult to get people to open up to get a real head count.
U.S. Department of Commerce,1ekf35ucs3khf000,4.0,"As an entry level intern, not all of my work was super interesting at first, however there was good opportunity for my advancement there.

U.S. Department of Commerce,1ejip9rc5u2v7800,4.0,There were many problems with how the online-training was accessed which slowed down the onboarding process. The supervisor I worked with was friendly although he didn't have answers to many of the problems I came across. I can't imagine how this process will be completed in 10 years time.
U.S. Department of Commerce,1eji8l3kenpdo800,3.0,"I'm an enumerator with the Census Bureau, so I just get my daily assignments, go to the addresses and knock on the doors. Seems pretty simple. Not so much. There are threats, dogs, etc. that you have to deal with, but you're generally well supported with, provided you can actually get through to your supervisor. We used iPhones on the Sprint network, which made it hard to get a good signal pretty much anywhere, so good luck calling into the office!"
U.S. Department of Commerce,1eji1k4bts7hg800,4.0,I enjoyed working with people until they became difficult.  I think it could have been more organized.   There were redundant addresses.  Any person would get upset if they waasked the same question four or five times.
U.S. Department of Commerce,1ej03l997sqbl800,5.0,nice office shame it has to end. Everyone is looking for a new job because it has to end. Only happens every 10 years. Hopefully I'll be able to do it in the 2030 census
U.S. Department of Commerce,1eiqqrenpocr4800,5.0,unorganized a nightmare some managers act like toddlers not  mangers and promotion is a joke if you are with the click the good old boys and girls club you will get promoted Quickly I have trained two clerks and both are supervisors  and mangers are not properly trained but the over all balance or work and family is great!!!

The people I worked with directly were professional, hardworking, dedicated to the task. This is an opportunity to help entire communities. Most people aren't aware of the importance of the Census, so explaining the purpose is often necessary as well. Repetitious in some ways. A necessary requirement is that an enumerator be excellent at people skills, reading, data entry, verbal communications, multi tasking, to be aware of surroundings at all times."

U.S. Department of Commerce,1ei1b3cfjr53c800,5.0,Pay rate was based on what county one lived in. This is very unfair ! People that lived in one county were paid less than people living in adjacent counties. The job pay rate should be the same for the job regardless of which county you lived in !! If everyone is doing the same job in the same general area; why is there a difference in pay rates?
U.S. Department of Commerce,1ehvv1nc3r53c800,5.0,"I worked as an enumerator for the census , it was fun and you get to work at your own pace and your schedule is based on your availability. Went to homes conducting interviews, most people were pleasant and helpful. Management was great."
U.S. Department of Commerce,1ehtbqjvsro7r800,2.0,I will never again make this mistake in life thinking working for the government is a prestigious position. These people employed here are quite illiterate an don’t seem to understand the process set forth. Once again I guess when doing the census for the government should be taken more seriously. The ACO is what they are called does not communicate with the enumerators enough to get an approximation of what the General population is to convey an accurate count.

U.S. Department of Commerce,1ehdk6tt5r4qu800,5.0,"Although is only temporary, I'm enjoying what I do. I wish it could be permanent. Unfortunately there's no growth when working with the CENSUS.

U.S. Department of Commerce,1eh8v2vb7p156800,5.0,This is a great job. Especially if you need a job where you set your own hours. I work 5 hours a day and still have time for all my school work. They are an amazing company to work for.

U.S. Department of Commerce,1egbh0ul3re2b800,5.0,"I was employed as a 2020 Census worker.  The time working for them was rewarding.  I gained experience and knowledge.

U.S. Department of Commerce,1ef6bje77rcmp800,1.0,"I've never seen this much disorganization. The office people are frightened of their managers with complete chaos everywhere. Most of the people I've spoken with were hired without an interview. I was hired as a supervisor with one question, but when I only got through half of my answer I was cut off and told your hired. Everyone seems to blame all the pressure on the Los Angeles Regional Center, This regional center from what I can tell is poorly run, If the President knew his offices were being run by this much of a lack of leadership, I'd sure he'd fire them all."
U.S. Department of Commerce,1eerh54gsp1h1800,5.0,"This employer allows many of their employees to multitask during crunch times.

U.S. Department of Commerce,1b518f5pr0kbr37c,4.0,Lots of opportunities and lateral transfers. A lot of activities to acclimatize an employee. Tons of benefits. If you like the government work culture and life style this is a great place to work. You might have to dig for information. Initiative is key in this workplace.
U.S. Department of Commerce,1b50js2fa0kbr2go,4.0,The office that I work in is busy as long as the Secretary is busy. Fast-paced and challenging. The hardest part of the job is the somewhat fluctuating deadlines.
U.S. Department of Commerce,1b4fmcg0faqhqbkm,3.0,"Working for the USPTO was overall a great experience. That being said, I believe it's difficult to have a satisfying career as a government employee. The flexibility is unbeatable since you are your own boss and effectively decide when and how long you want to work. Along those lines, you can start working from home with two years of joining the USPTO typically. The problem is that you may have a quota that is unreasonably high since it based on bad data. In my position, I had an extremely high quota that made it stressful to keep up with a never-ending docket. That is perhaps the worst part of the job. Since you have a quota, you effectively never have downtime because there is a backlog and always another case waiting to be examined. It's not like other jobs where you are waiting on team members or a deliverable and are effectively between work and have downtime. The management is horrible, pretty much what you would imagine at a government agency. While the work is intensive and difficult, I usually found it interesting and was never bored. Learning about inventions and the patent process from the inside is invaluable experience and the ability to work from home is awesome. Bottom line: it's great experience but I think it is difficult to stay long-term."

U.S. Department of Commerce,1b3r8muqjakajdmo,5.0,"The USPTO and the Examiners were wonderful, but the life as a contractor was horrible. CGI and ASRC trainers were under identical expectations but CGI trainers were paid $20k less and were exempt from any promotions or advancement. CGI managers were lazy, out of touch, and in my case, flat out rude and abusive."

U.S. Department of Commerce,1aqktsmm9as3pbe1,3.0,Everyday rules changed about how we had to perform our job. As time went on there was less and less to do therefor not much pay. If there was any questions the supervisor never had the information needed.

I bought my very first SUV based on Japan reviews before the vehicle made it to the U.S.  Department of Commerce has potential.  If you are looking for rapid career growth do not apply to this agency.  They do not offer very many high level jobs.
U.S. Department of Commerce,1alskitb7b88s86j,4.0,"Although the census does require you to go house to house interviewing people no matter the weather conditions, they do offer good pay and you pick your own hours. But weekends is when you are expected to work. Working for the census can be physically and mentally draining as you walk to up to 25 houses in a day and sometimes have to deal with difficult, or rude people. But one of the things I liked about it is that you are only assigned houses that are in or around your city where you live. So I had the great opportunity to meet and get to know my community better. I learned more about the people who live in my neighborhood, and learned how to communicate with several different people from different cultural backgrounds. With the census, you are always on your own and only speak to your supervisor if you have a question or problem. You never meet your coworkers unless there is a meeting. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with rude people, but the census does teach you to always keep yourself safe and to leave an address if you feel like you are in danger. But the most enjoyable part would be being able to pick my own hours to work with my schedule and getting to know your community better."

Coworkers are smart and knowledgeable and most of them I met are willing to help and easy to get along with. However, it can be very stressful to meet the bi-weekly production goals and a lot of overtime is required. It is difficult to have a work-life balance at times.

I learned a lot about how to behave in a professional workplace, office communication, and the value of paying attention to detail. The management was well structured, and my supervisors were supportive, patient and welcoming. The hardest part of the internship was learning the value of attention to detail.

U.S. Department of Commerce,16tfrcfu95dogeo2,1.0,"From the first day I walked thru the doors people looked at me with wide eyes and mouths gapped open. I was hired from a phone interview and when they realized I was Black they were a bit surprised. I was excluded from critical meetings, promised staff to assist that did not happen for nearly a year, denied promotion and my position was not extended past a yr, yet a person was hired 2 wks after I left who was a friend of the Director. They became angry that I did not hire their friends and family and excluded me from critical staff meetings. I felt ostracized and those who wanted to be kind to me felt threatened and were reluctant for management to know that they were being civil to me. I arrived for work early, worked late,and usually ate at my desk. One day I had to walk to one of the satelite offices and on my way back decided to take my lunch break to get cleaning supplies to clean the used and dirty desk they assigned to me. When I returned I was counseled for taking to long to come back. I constantly felt like I was an outsider and not a member of the team. It was a very stressful time for me.

I'd learned how to deal with people to convince them so they fill our questionnaire, supervision, and organization. My co-workers were cooperative and knew teamwork meaning.

I would say generally the admins are looked down on by the scientists, though. Pay is pretty good for industry, but not enough for cost of living in Boulder. And while there are many career folks here, it means many are resistant to change and there is no succession planning so organizational knowledge disappears when someone leaves. New management has been stirring up a lot of trouble - some changes are necessary (processes, moving into 21st century tech), others are not (organizational restructuring of admin staff to ""Shared Services"" model)."

I learnt about diversity, climate change and some of the good research they do in regards to tornado's, dung beetle, west Niles & weather. I had the privilege of getting to  know a few of the scientist. We lost some really good people higher up in management due to funds cut, retirement & layoffs. I was one of the people left with the most knowledge of our front desk services & all other co-workers and management came in from outside UCAR, this made things a little difficult for me and it was time to move on. The culture was great! for a long time we were very diverse, not sure how diverse the culture is now. Hardest part of the job was keeping up during times we had new hires, visitors or special projects.

InVitae,1f3oprng93guf000,2.0,Invitae culture changed for the worse during the expansion from 700+ to 1500+ people.  The pressure to hire brought staff in who cared less for the culture than regurgitating a word salad of cool catch phrases in the industry - some managers came and went who seemed to produce nothing of value.  This was most apparent within the developer / engineering group which was re-organized so frequently that it was difficult for the front line employees to get work done.
InVitae,1f20cdi4gt4cq800,2.0,Interviewers and job descriptions talk a great game about transparency and honesty and the like.

This person continued to talk about multiple employees. She would leave horrible notes in the reporting system. Now she is a lead. Management says they care about this but if you promote people like this you really don’t. Now you have a horrible person as a lead and people who think that’s the way to advancement. Add that to lay offs and you got a lot of scared people that will do anything to keep their job. Not good.

The company offers a great service helping people take control of their health and get informed early.  However, I was in billing and it was not the same feeling as San Fran. Billing did not follow the ""Invitae policy"" for working remote. Where other departments were allowed to WFH when they were sick or if they needed to be permanently remote workers. This is something that we all in billing thought was the normal thing, but as Management changed in billing, those options went away. I could not understand why it would be better to not work from home even if we offered, to keep from getting backed up.  If I didn`t work in billing I never would have left."

The best part of the job is the shear number of programs you can participate in to help patients."
InVitae,1cbb37fvabrcq8j0,3.0,Flat structure at Invitae make it hard for anyone to get help and train properly. Lack of structure management mean you have to figure out what was going on in the group by yourself and what projects you needed to work on. Lack of structure mean everyone in the company gave you review and sometimes they were anonymous. People were so caught up about getting good reviews that they will be fake nice and fake helpful to you. Those same people would give you bad reviews anonymously and saying that you were not smart enough or work not hard enough.  People want to get good review so bad that they would act smart and know it all and become very difficult to rely on them.

The site had changed hands a good number of times, but not progressed very much in technology or systems knowledge.  Rather than bringing in new more efficient work flows, there was a tendency to keep the old way and add more levels of complication.  After coming from a company that was more innovative and open to change for better flow and efficiency, it was quite a stifling site.

My constructive feedback after the interviews was always that my examples were not great and that I required more experience for the role. One time I was even told that I should remove ""bilingual"" from my CV skills section because it was not relevant to the actual role.  I decided to apply outside and got a job on my first interview with a higher salary and   ""basically"" got promoted from my previous title. Overall, Pfizer is a good place to work and learn, but if you feel stuck on your career like any other job you should consider other opportunities."
Pfizer,1f38pkm2du3bc800,1.0,"Management at the McPherson site is terrible at best. They have their favorites, and don't give 2 s#@+s about anybody or anything as long as the assistants get the product out and supervisors and management can get their bonuses! And if we don't, then look out!"
Pfizer,1f1mr0pqeu40q800,3.0,"If you weren't a female or great friends of females in management, you were meaningless and quickly replaceable. I was off for Covid as high risk and when I was able to return to work, I wasn't offered a position. I was terminated instead."
Pfizer,1f0s6edgkn54g800,3.0,"Good benefits for sure, 3 weeks paid vacation when you are hired in. Pay is not great, 3 percent yearly raise don’t even cover inflation. You need to suck up to management and snitch on everyone else to advance in most departments. Only a few good departments left. People who are lazy still get rewarded when those who work hard don’t get rewarded. Not like it used to be when it was UpJohn!"
Pfizer,1f0kurdtks7jc800,5.0,"Wonderful job at a great place to work. Many perks such as holiday meals, tuition reimbursement, in-house gym, care and recognition program, and high-quality and affordable healthcare to name a few."
Pfizer,1f0en4bmmt4q1800,3.0,"Great benefits but it’s hard using them due to supervisors, that’s it.management don’t care about the workers, they only care about getting the product out and getting certain numbers."
Pfizer,1f09a8phht458800,1.0,Just a horrible place to work . No backing from upper management. HR is useless and never calls you back on anything until the 6th or 7th call. Run away from this place .
Pfizer,1evs6f9pfn52h800,5.0,great place to work
Pfizer,1evr34d3826a4000,3.0,Management doesn’t care and has horrible communication in vial packaging department with employees. Management tends to not care about the the colleagues.
Pfizer,1evl0uo52sa8h800,5.0,its's was a well organized structure and work culture.  Some of the bosses were fair and a few were not but the majority of them were good. The pay was excellent for the amount of work and with incentives.  Overall a great company to work for.
Pfizer,1evk2umdpsa8h800,2.0,"You have to fit the culture to be liked and be allowed to advance. Some layoffs are a cover-up to get rid of people that they never hire back. Manages personal feelings play a big role in who can advance and thrive. The field was never leveled for everyone. I was kept at entry level for 7 to 8 years and my hard work overlooked. After I got laid off for “downsizing “ reasons, hundreds of jobs that fit my job description were posted. I applied for hundreds of jobs till today and was never selected. One time recruiter submit my profile, The profile was selected and I was going to interview, as I show up for interview one of my old colleague came out and told me that it was a mistake and I was never called for interview and sent me away. People can create lies about you and there is no due process about anything for some people and no accountability for actions of some managers."
Pfizer,1c8l1p5t21d1213m,4.0,"I think the site that I worked for had many unique issues.  The site had changed hands a good number of times, but not progressed very much in technology or systems knowledge.  Rather than bringing in new more efficient work flows, there was a tendency to keep the old way and add more levels of complication.  After coming from a company that was more innovative and open to change for better flow and efficiency, it was quite a stifling site.  The culture stayed the same because the people who stayed had little experience elsewhere and were opposed to change."
Pfizer,1evi07cnes7kr800,3.0,"Great flexibility and benefits. Pay is not very competitive with other big pharma companies.  Diversity is a check box, no real action. If you are comfortable in one place and not concerned with advancing your career this could be the place for you."
Pfizer,1ev6fihu7t5ho800,4.0,It’s hard to be nimble when you’re big and slow and clumsy. That’s just the way it is with behemoths. The pharmaceutical industry has lost much of its historical security and now has frequent job cuts.
Pfizer,1eum8v213u1ib800,3.0,"Pfizer is a good company to work for, but moving up in the company is extremely hard to do. They have their picks on who they want to have certain jobs. It’s not fair. No one wants to be working on a line their whole life. Some of the leaders have favorites and they let certain ones do whatever and get first dibs on vacation. This is the Rocky Mount plant. Even if you go to HR with serious ongoing issues, they don’t do anything about it. It’s gotten to a point where people HATE coming to work because everything is so unorganized and dysfunctional."
Pfizer,1eue7p2nto1i6800,4.0,"I was lucky to work with Pfizer for over a year. I had an amazing manager and team. The culture and leadership exceeded my expectations. The salary, compensation and benefits are all well over acceptable."
Pfizer,1eu2i13fc3kh5000,2.0,At lot of great colleagues and projects ongoing at Pfizer. Fair pay and benefits. Labs are outfitted with the latest technology. The chance to positively affect patients.
Pfizer,1eu1qp0ihnq1f800,5.0,"You’ll work very hard, but it’s very rewarding.  Many areas for advancement.  You’ll see things that you won’t anywhere else.  You’ll feel part of a large mission and feel very proud to work for this company."
Pfizer,1etqevvl6u312800,5.0,"Groton CT location: Great benefits and pay are cool but, the folks that work there have created a positive and supportive, team goal oriented culture. Groton CT is defiantly not a destination place to live, but it's more affordable compared to other places in New England."
Pfizer,1etddmikdu1n1800,1.0,The people were rude. Training was non existent! The possibility of advancing wasn't there!! Boss would rather be SOME  people's friend. Depends on who you are!! Wasn't there even a yr. And left for less money less benefits.but a better environment! Training was a big factor for me and it never happened! I had no training!
Pfizer,1etbic3khu1n1800,5.0,Good culture and supportive environment. People at Pfizer do genuinely care about the patients they support and the work they do. There is always a group of people ready to provide support if needed.
Pfizer,1eta8eg3mu1lf800,5.0,"I've been in the admin role for about a year now (right before COVID19 shutdowns). Employees were already empowered to work from home because WFH was already standard. But aside frm that, my experience has been great. My manager is supportive and the team I work with is great."
Pfizer,1et8eog19t52l800,5.0,I worked at ppfizer part-time for more than a year
Pfizer,1et84sdf2u1n1800,3.0,This is a great place to work with a great reputation.  You will work with really smart people and dedicated people and you will learn from them every day.  Unfortunately there have been a lot of layoffs.
Pfizer,1et5dieuuu1n1800,3.0,Management is hands off which can often be good and helps develop a sense of trust. Generally management does not have experience in the skill you work so support is not there and understanding of day to day needs are absent causing poor leadership decision making and knee jerk reactions to issues.
Pfizer,1et59engqt52l800,4.0,"Maybe hard to progress in some departments but overall great place to work. Work life balance, educational support. Good benefits. Generally has a good work culture"
Pfizer,1et28hvvmu1lf800,4.0,"I love the people I worked with, the pay was amazing, the benefits were great, and the 401K match was higher than anywhere else I know of. Unfortunately, they eliminated my entire shift and got rid of a lot of people that were led to believe that they were secure in their position. We were basically blindsided and left with no job. It would have been better if the company had handled it differently. Realistically, I know businesses have to make cuts where need be, but the sheer lack of concern for their employees livelihoods and the misleading illusion that we were all safe with our jobs really didn't sit well with me."
Pfizer,1esmqrajlu3cn800,5.0,"Spent 5+ years with the Consumer Healthcare Division located in Madison, New Jersey. Great place to work and enjoyed the people at Pfizer. The Consumer Healthcare division was bought by GSK in a joint-venture."
Pfizer,1esmdda8bt4lr800,5.0,"The shared services office in Memphis had a terrific work environment. There were many opportunities to get involved with projects, move within the organization, or be promoted. The culture was top notch."
Pfizer,1eshdrto13h86000,4.0,"frequent reorganizing which may result in big layoffs, relatively less bureaucracy comparing to European style company, but less opportunity for personal development and less flexibility"
Pfizer,1es5pe4bk3ogl000,5.0,Great place to work!! Management is fantastic and encourages upward mobility. Great products and company culture. Be sure to know and research the meds you will be selling and be prepared to answer for the interview.

Pfizer,1erekpoumu1sr800,5.0,Great people and culture. They have a great pipeline but that is several years away and they have had 3 major products go generic.  This is why they have restructured and had 2 layoffs in approximately one year.
Pfizer,1eqv118g2u49m800,2.0,People were friendly...
Pfizer,1eqtambasu49m800,5.0,Great place to work  great learning technology very family oriented  I would highly recommend this company to any one.Pfizer cares about their employees
Pfizer,1eqr6otm5o2gs800,4.0,My micromanager was a nightmare.  My division had many supply challenges that made the job  challenging.  A good company if I had a different manager.
Pfizer,1eqq1ch6dsa99800,2.0,Party pals and tight sweaters went a long way for promotions and bonus money.  Work your butt off and get pushed aside for a directors pal or gal pal to take your job.  A sad situation overall.   Quite glad I moved on.
Pfizer,1eqnd94hfu35m800,1.0,If you like dealing with fake people being underpaid and high levels of stress then this is the company for you. Undertraining to deal with dangerous equipment and chemicals. A culture that is ok with harassments of all kinds
Pfizer,1eqd93l6nu35m800,4.0,"Loved the environment in this company, professional plus while balancing people needs. Not every company has this in the mix they have it.  Leadership team is what you would expect, very good at what they do."
Pfizer,1eqarq12du35m800,5.0,Profesional excelente cultura de cero defectos. Bastante retador
Pfizer,1eq8tdn9bu49m800,5.0,"As a temp worker I enjoyed my time at Pfizer, it was something different and I learned a lot. The people there were absolutely fantastic and a pleasure to work with. The lack of communication between higher ups and their team needs improvement. Overall this company is very good but it just needs to have more benefits for it's contingent workers and not just count them out in everything."
Pfizer,1epsup1scu49m800,5.0,The benefits and pay are amazing! I love my job and I'm proud to say I am a Pfizer Global Employee #PGEproud! I recommend this company as an employee to everyone willing to OWN IT!
Pfizer,1epnmnnf0sa97800,3.0,"Good pay and benefits. Decent work life balance. I'm accustomed to working night shift. 3rd shift was let go due to slow production but they made sure that we were paid for the next 60 day, which is a blessing for families with kids."
Pfizer,1eopqj26ts7f8800,3.0,"You may be the perfect fit. But connections play a major role. You always seem to find out after because someone slips up and tells others they were tagged for the position. They pick who they want. If you have strong performance, they are looking for something else, if you don’t have strong performance then that’s the reason. You get the picture"
Pfizer,1eoj74uejs7f8800,5.0,Good company overall. CEO is inspiring.  Benefits are good.  Industry can be tough depending on your location. Large company with a lot of internal chains of command.
Pfizer,1eohmqb68u44g800,5.0,Good place to work and the pay is good. The people are friendly and management is easy to get along with. The work is easy and fulfilling. You'll be satisfied that you are employed there.
Pfizer,1eog479hfu1io800,4.0,Great place to work if you didn't have to worry about being laid-off all the time. The people there are very friendly but you have to ask alot of questions to know whats going on sometimes.
Pfizer,1eof98oqvs7cn800,5.0,"The HR Team I worked with remains the smartest and most engaged group of HR professionals I have worked with in my40 years in HR.  They challenged each other to exceed every expectation, willingly helped one another to succeed, and truly cared about the team members and the business."
Pfizer,1eo8bbf3au2ju800,4.0,Not a bad place to work if you can handle the pressure and workload. Lots to do and standards strictly enforced and adhered to all areas of work. Good place
Pfizer,1ench17m9s7de800,5.0,"Worked there for 22 years, and 2 as a contractor.  To be honest, I was treated better even as a contractor then my previous job with General Dynamic’s."
Pfizer,1en1h2ak5o22b800,5.0,"Great company to work for!  I was able to grow with the company and get promoted, but they eventually outsourced our entire department.  I had a great severance so I took it instead of working for the outsourced company."
Pfizer,1en1ftdost51g800,5.0,"I learned the entire process of pharmacovigilance, drug safety. Extensive training on the system, medical coding, case processing, signal detection and the importance of the entire concept of drug safety. Excellent support system from other colleagues and mentors."

Pfizer,1en0v9j72t51u800,5.0,Great benefits but quotas can be stressful and are often moving targets. The job really comes down to having a good manager or a not so good manager. My manager was excellent so I really enjoyed my experience with Pfizer.
Pfizer,1en060csru3d8800,3.0,Work-life balance
Pfizer,1emughsmut51u800,5.0,Excellent company to work for.
Pfizer,1emsj6q73u38g800,4.0,"If your manager is good, you are set.  If you get a micromanager, it can be tough.  I've had both with the company and it's a much better ride with someone who just lets you run your territory, as long as you're performing."
Pfizer,1empmv56ps7le800,5.0,The best company you can work for and the benefit so good my management lovely I wish go back to Pfizer again my supervisor my manager my co worker’s I miss every one again Pfizer is the best company you can work for!

Pfizer,1em7bhp29u1nm800,4.0,It's kind of sad that Indeed forces you to write a review just to read reviews about a company.
Pfizer,1elj134e5u2j4800,1.0,"Multiple layers of leadership that diluted and covered their own ineffectiveness overshadowed opportunities for patient health, employee utilization and productive marketing. A truly corporate centric environment , short term result focused with long term success sacrificed."
Pfizer,1elbtqc0ju2j4800,4.0,There is a huge sense of pride in what we manufacture. The people are great to work with. Management can sometimes be unappreciative of employees and demand more from those that they know can do it. Situations are very different depending on the department you are in. There is huge pressure on timely release of batches with high quality. The work is stressful often but rewarding for what we do for our end customers (patients).
Pfizer,1el6u7a50u2j4800,1.0,Company is set to close end of 2020 to end of 2021. Moving product to Mexico don’t waste your time. Like everything Pfizer touches takes all the money and sends jobs someplace else a very non American company
Pfizer,1el359flvsabu800,1.0,Pfizer employee only care about their fulltime workers. They are very rude and does not say Goodmorning and when you speak to them they just look at you. The supervisors is never in the work area and never answers the phone. This job is very unorganized and does not work as a team they aspect the temps to do everything and doesn’t say nothing to the fulltime people.the full timers call in all the time but wants to fire the temps for calling in
Pfizer,1el193eofu2f5800,4.0,Great job.  Good benfits. Some occasional management issues.  Company valued employees.  Clean working environment. Human Resources staff were very helpful.
Pfizer,1ekfqth4e3o7v000,3.0,"Management is a joke. Company's are so goal driven they don't recognize good work, they don't recognize their employees personal lives. For some people, thats what they need. Im just glad I am self driven and don't need recognition and can get by showing up and just doing my job. So if you are one of those who thrive off of recognition and a gold star, then this isn't the place to work."
Pfizer,1ekck0ng4t3qb800,1.0,I can't stress enough. Working there is horrible. Run far away. Your coworkers will become your enemies. Your supervisors are spineless cowards. Human resources offsite in Kalamazoo...shes incompetent. The only pro is the pay....you will hear other employees say.
Pfizer,1ek2q46bvs7ds800,5.0,Overall
Pfizer,1ek21tmj5o2cn800,5.0,"they ensure that employees all behave and work in a way that reflects company'svalues: integrity, excellence and respect for people. they also keep diversity and inclusion in the forefront of everything we do.

Pfizer,1ejj52faau1l6800,3.0,Lots of testing which can be stressful for some. Seems hard to be promoted from your current position. Was told that pay was lower than other inspection jobs in other fields
Pfizer,1ej6didi6u1dj800,3.0,"Don't try to get on as a contractor.  Wait to get on direct. Will miss my 12 hour shifts however.  To be honest, I'm just writing this so I can view the reviews for another company."

Pfizer,1ei9vbr61ocr4800,4.0,I worked in a few departments at Rocky Mount and it is a great place to learn pharmaceutical manufacturing on a large scale and aseptic techniques. Culture is different for each department and the hardest part of the job is driving to Rocky Mount. The older facilities are great to learn but the new facility is where new technology and learning currently is.

Pfizer,1eg8afu4hr3bb800,3.0,"The benefits are great. Many people in management are not there to improve their department- you can tell they just want power and money. It's easy to get ""blacklisted"" if you challenge their opinions. It's a huge site so other departments might not be like that."

Pfizer,1dv80l2kp4rmh800,3.0,"This is  company that has ridden their past success for many years, with no innovation.  Products are old, and the company will not revamp efforts to innovate, because of fear of failure.  Too much arrogance on how profitable they are...."
Pfizer,1dv72isifh6vj802,5.0,Pfizer Inc is my favorite company I have worked .  Excellent experience  and professional growth. I am so thankful for all amazing people work beside every day .
Pfizer,1c8l1p5t21d1213m,4.0,"I think the site that I worked for had many unique issues.  The site had changed hands a good number of times, but not progressed very much in technology or systems knowledge.  Rather than bringing in new more efficient work flows, there was a tendency to keep the old way and add more levels of complication.  After coming from a company that was more innovative and open to change for better flow and efficiency, it was quite a stifling site.  The culture stayed the same because the people who stayed had little experience elsewhere and were opposed to change."
Pfizer,1dv4hn4o34s1i801,5.0,Great place to work with excellent benefits. A lot of work to do but the analyst always has the oppprtunity to challenge the process and add value to the existing one.

Pfizer,1dv0n4ouko2bd802,2.0,"Money is good but lines get crossed way too easy out there and the communication is not good. Still at a bit of a loss with losing my car in a flood my third day of orientation and  had to get a motel room for that second night or I would not have made it back to orientation and would have been let go. Then every other week for 5 to 6 weeks after, my checks kept getting smaller. KRONOS SUCKS! But once that got hammered out which took an act of congress things have smoothed out and hopefully get better. Time will tell."
Pfizer,1dv0fv53fhbn8802,3.0,"There’s a lot of good with the company but the detractors out weight the good. Flex hours and work life balance was good but the dishonesty, lack of loyalty, and management's own personal interest take away from the positivity significantly. It’s really a culture of actions speak louder than words and unfortunately the actions are usually undermining the words."
Pfizer,1dv0bogprhbn8803,5.0,"I was on contract, therefore no say for suggestions."
Pfizer,1dv09a6q4hatr803,5.0,Workplace culture was great with friendly people willing to help and nurture you. The hardest part of the job was the boss who was well known for her nastiness

Pfizer,1durljaethb8s802,1.0,"Pfizer CRU was an amazing place to work a few years ago, unfortunately that is no longer the case. Management is nonexistent due to inexperienced staff given management positions. Out of control favoritism, unfairness, and total mistrust of supervisors/management has created a hostile work environment. Staff won’t speak up out of fear of retaliation. So sad to see a lot of the good staff leave."
Pfizer,1dur3hu93hb8s802,3.0,"My day starts at Pfizer at 0530 or so. Understand the pass down from the night shift. Communicate with manager discuss where we are and what we want to accomplish before the end of the shift. Work place culture is pretty good, some of the difficulties are having he components when you need them and staying on task. I enjoy putting product out to oiur comusters."
Pfizer,1dunjl0rr25jq002,5.0,Working at Pfizer was a great experience. Management was knowledgable and very useful in problem solving. In the microbiology labs everyone worked as a team to ensure that the product was safe to leave the facility.

Pfizer,1duj87tb3hdak803,4.0,"Good pace, professional, and slightly diverse. Location is in a tiny town in central KS. May not be ideal for young seekers who enjoy the hustle and bustle of larger metro cities."
Pfizer,1duib99v34t2o801,5.0,I was familiar with the colleagues that worked around me and everyone was very approachable at all levels.

Pfizer,1dugao4plhe31802,3.0,"Manager expects you to know exactly who/where/how to make contacts within company on your own front he get go without direction. Projects are new, innovative, and fun to work on. Only bad experience is with a specific manager."

Pfizer,1dufre4pi58kr802,3.0,"Pfizer survives a lot on its historical reputation. Right now, management is in the midst of changing a lot which is needed but it's very bumpy and gives a sense to employees that the senior leadership doesn't have a grand plan and is reacting and making short term fixes. Strategies and focus change on a regular basis. If you can weather the roller coasters you can have a fruitful career there. Benefits are good. But it can be frustrating waiting it out and going through the charades."
Pfizer,1c8l1p5t21d1213m,4.0,"I think the site that I worked for had many unique issues.

Pfizer,1dsnaqq7jq4ms806,4.0,"Pfizer was a laid back job.. I liked the hours and my job. .Mangement was a joke and many of the people were jerks but overall, it was ok.  There was a a lot of redundant paperwork and changing clothes."

Pfizer,1drljl800o9cm802,5.0,"The position I filled was to fill the company's needs for clinical material.  For the most part, we knew ahead of time what the production schedule was going to be like and could account for future needs with plenty of preparation.  As such, the production schedule afforded us ample opportunity to prepare for future needs while handling our current requirements."
Pfizer,1drl3b5tq24gp003,4.0,"Often had to work late and some weekends to meet release schedules. Able to take laptop home to do work. Priorities often change throughout the day, so focus has to shift on a dime. Able to purchase a week's vacation above that earned. Good diversity and equal respect for all.

I know that I have more to offer and a higher skill set now and am looking for something more challenging."
Pfizer,1dr53us8r24gi003,2.0,"I worked at the Clinical Research Unit and had strongly defined tasks. There was quite a bit of training and oversight for the type of work that is being done understandably. The co-workers are nice, management tended to be overly distrustful and difficult to please. It was the first job I ever had that I felt that way. I noticed that was a cultural influence as during my time there, I saw new people rotate into oversight roles and become the same way. Overall, for a paycheck it is ok but it's not a place to grow your long term career."

Pfizer,1dq5t1gqf5n9t802,5.0,"Awesome internship, great campus. I was only there for a summer internship in the IT department.

Pfizer,1dpm29762h3i7801,5.0,"Pfizer is an excellent company to work for and offers many career advancement opportunities. They take care of their employees and the culture is very collaborative, caring, friendly and competitive. It is a very ethical company and decisions although can take long, they are always balanced and fair. The hardest part of the job is to find out who else is working on the same problem and whether they are willing to join hands and address the challenge together. Mediocrity also exists at some senior levels which is a function of a large corporation that pays well so employees are willing to invest only so much effort to get the job done. Frequent organizational structuring is common and people rotate very frequently thus not investing enough in their current roles. The most enjoyable part is to work with like minded hard working and smart people and knowing that we are solving modern day problems through well researched and market priced drugs."

However, career growth opportunities are limited, unless you are connected, build great PowerPoint decks and live on the east coast. If you are a hands on individual (i.e. someone who actually does the work, chances of being promoted are slim - because then who would actually get any work done??). Stock price is a sham, so no point in counting any long term stock incentives towards overall comp. Not clear where the company is headed...hiring like crazy followed immediately by layoffs, would rather hire from outside than promote from within"
Pfizer,1do1pa94eh3t6802,3.0,No interview the job wasn't continued as they didn't like my fork lift skills. I was told my position wasn't extended or that their was any problem.

Pfizer,1dn5cligb52vr806,2.0,I was contracted through a staffing agency and the job description was more for an office job not the job I got in procurement. The training was awful...needed to be trained hands on not by watching and having read to me slide shows.

Pfizer,1dmrj9e0252vr802,2.0,"The site as a whole is unorganized and a work environment I'd rather not be in.  Higher up management did not care about the EM especially night shift; no compensation for the ones that lived far or anything.  Felt very unappreciated and rushed many times and was actually injured there before I left but felt highly uncomfortable to say anything because I was just ready to go and down and out at the time anyways.  Taught me a lot as far as how I should carry myself in my future career endeavors, however, was one of the easy but worst jobs I've ever embarked on so far."

Pfizer,1dmjrsa2n5nab804,3.0,Good company to work for. Great pay and benefits. Good people to work with. You can have a good balance of work and family time. Must be a team player or you will fail. Management is the biggest problem here though. Care more about the company than the workers.

Pfizer,1dmj033rth3gu800,2.0,"High School Drama all day long, Management is horrible, Supervisors not Trained well but the pay is what keeps people there.  The hardest part of the job is the fact that people try to get others in trouble 24/7, nobody minds their own business and too many chiefs, not enough Indians."
Pfizer,1dmfph764h44r802,2.0,"With management detached from their production and personnel allowed to under-perform without any expectation of improvement, this place is sinking. Rapidly. Don't expect to move upward without having a relative working there presently, or an ability to avoid any confrontation at all. The pay may be competitive but the forced overtime isn't, especially when the production problems can be blamed on a lack of solid action plans from different management divisions. People who don't support their co-workers face no repercussions and will continue to drag down all aspects of production without any expectation of improvement. Seriously consider whether you want to work in this environment, and if you do, don't expect to stay for a sizable length of time."

I was expecting some hard work while keeping the floor running, I wasn't expecting to be constantly dealing with the same issue every day due to machines that were too old to function at the overclocked rate of production we were operating at. Mechanics didn't care either, accepting issues as ""that's how it's always been."""

Pfizer,1dlj224oj24et000,3.0,QC department is not a good work environment. Company has good benefits and salary. Retaliation is real when you are not part of status quo. Many employees have only worked there so closed mindset and feel threatened by newcomers. Its a high school playground.

There were days where a product got delayed to reach us yet we would have to rush to finish our verifications before our deadlines. I enjoyed those days. However, I would not want them to be every day. They had quite a lot of activities to attend by HR team.

Pfizer,1diu9fv5fh46t800,3.0,"Pfizer is a great place to work in general. It's very collaborative, team is supportive, and the work is challenging and fast-paced. Co-workers are very professional, friendly, intelligent, and highly educated. It was a pleasure working there. There are some drawbacks. As a contractor, you are definitely a second-class citizen. It's annoying, but it's the culture, so it's not really personal. The other difficulty is that IT is not the primary business of the company, so does not have modern software lifecycle processes or IT project managers who hold degrees in systems development. It can be hard to do innovative work at times."
Pfizer,1ditf6aldh3gh800,5.0,Good company to work for.
Pfizer,1disfk85j0mcg000,5.0,Very good company with a proven track record. Excellent benefits and pay. Work/life balance was respectable but i did work 12 hour shifts.

It was required to be in the office 3 days per week and then be online for meetings with colleagues outside of the US at early morning/late night hours.

Pfizer,1dih3j74l5j7h800,2.0,The clinical group relies on a first gen wingspan eTMF which is slow and antiquated.  Training for the group was long and communication was difficult.  Group needs better more qualified managers.  Everything is out sourced which makes quality and compliance issues.

Pfizer,1c8l1p5t21d1213m,4.0,"I think the site that I worked for had many unique issues.  The site had changed hands a good number of times, but not progressed very much in technology or systems knowledge.  Rather than bringing in new more efficient work flows, there was a tendency to keep the old way and add more levels of complication.  After coming from a company that was more innovative and open to change for better flow and efficiency, it was quite a stifling site.  The culture stayed the same because the people who stayed had little experience elsewhere and were opposed to change."

Pfizer,1di5hkdju5j6o801,4.0,"I am currently working at the Rochester MI. site I transferred over from Kalamazoo. I have been here 3yrs and the culture and management here are much different than those in Kalamazoo. This site has cultural issues, morale issues ,management issues. They loosely follows Blue Book Company Wide Established conducts of behavior. I once had a voice when I was with this company in Kalamazoo, I was disciplined and wrote up for the first and only time which I disagreed with but was blown off by Senior management as I tried to pursue open door policy in blue book. This site and its management say they want your input but the way they treat their subordinates says otherwise. I have 8yrs invested in my career with this company but I am on here searching out other opportunities due to the lack of respect and appreciation I have endured at this site. I am hard working and dedicated even more so when treated properly, unfortunately the management and culture of this place will drain that out of you. I am thankful for my time with this company but when respect and appreciation are no longer being served it is time to move on. I hope this site gets up to true Pfizer standards In policy and treatment of employees but they have a long way to go."

Pfizer,1dhvf2qhh5nba800,1.0,"Worked there for a short time as Quality Operation Professional. Typical workday was very stressful. I was expected to work over 50 hours a week. I was required to support remotely on my off days. Management required me to be available 24/7 over the phone. The worst part of the job was the bad culture, and mean local people. Local people are very clickish, and play dirty politics against any out of state people or people of colored who are rarely hired. Those local mangers and supervisors hire other locals from their church- very unprofessional. They will not cooperate with others who are not local or are colored. Hostile environment."
Pfizer,1dhrq9m465nfr800,3.0,This is one of the easiest jobs ever. It does not require hard labor. Pay could be better and management could be better as well. In my opinion there is a lot of pettiness and favoritism.
Pfizer,1dhroh1dh52so801,1.0,"Pfizer sucks would advise people to work there.Upper management moved people around to much.Putting the in position to fail and be terminated.At times to much over time,needed more help."

Pfizer,1dhl47ajnh3j7802,3.0,"Depending on where you work at this company, it can be either rewarding or overly demanding.  There are those in any business who demand too much, overtasking employees and not wanting to hear complaints, but there are those who are good people doing great jobs to provide quality products.  There are also those who respond to compliance requests or other tasks with ""I'll get to it when I get to it"".  There are a lot of good people here, but the culture has suffered a significant decline with the loss of great talent, as well as some management who acts belligerently to those who differ to agree even when compliance is on the line.  Nonetheless, perhaps with new talent coming in, it can be restored to greatness, building with those who remain who seek not themselves, but providing the consumer with the best experience possible and looking out for the health of the consumer."
Pfizer,1dhjqqjc2h3pp802,5.0,"This environment has a lot of cool fun aspects or things to do to give a break from the mundane work day.

Pfizer,1dgdbg2b524ev000,5.0,it’s a great place to work if you get hired on directly by Pfizer but I would strongly suggest to not hire in under manpower which is what they will push you to do.
Pfizer,1dgd3eimd24ev000,1.0,"My review to the job is ok, needs a lot of work with communication from supervisor to co-workers. At times managers and supervisors don't take communication under consideration and assume certain situations that would allow them to mislead co-workers."

Pfizer,1dg8l4t4924fc000,1.0,"Pfizer, McPherson has no visible Human Resources at all. Shots are called by Area Supervisors with little or no training in the areas of employment law on discrimination. You need to be in the “good ole boys” club to survive.  Little to no training provided new hires, most are contracted though Manpower and have no voice or backup. If they want to get rid of you supervisors will ask those in the “Club” and will manufacture a reason to terminate without any warning or discussion with you about needed improvement. They simply tell Manpower to tell you you’re done. Most tense, watch your back place of employment I have seen in over 50 years of employment. Could not recommend to anyone with honesty, dedication, and desire to work for an honest paycheck and desire to grow."

Pfizer,1dfv48t5124ek000,1.0,If you fit in you will work out great. Don't say anything about being bullied if you are even though in there beginning course it says no bullying. Pay is good. If you have to go through temp service it might take longer than a month to get switched to Pfizer.

Pfizer,1dfsc0bll1d11000,4.0,Good work life balance but it is large and bureaucratic  organization so change takes some time. They have a great work from home policy and the ability to work from hundreds of sites across the world makes it very good for relocation options.

Pfizer,1dffmihgk24eh000,5.0,I really have nothing to say on this matter.  I am really not sure why they are requiring it.

Pfizer,1deqrdaq3brdo800,3.0,High turnover rate in management. The Vaccine business unit is the worst place to work at Pfizer. Other business units such as oncology were more laid back and not as stressed out as people in vaccine development group.
Pfizer,1deqh1flsbrdo800,4.0,"Working at Pfizer for 2 years during the sale of Hospira to ICU Medical was an experience. Pfizer treated the Infusion Pump System with respect and integrity.

Pfizer,1deae8d8lh414800,3.0,"The hardest part of the job was being expected to meet demands of production while sacrificing time at home with no chance of advancement, pay increase, or respect. A typical day was organizing the floor whether through employees being placed on lines or supplies for the day. The workplace culture when I started was that we were a family and supported one another this way. When I left it was more every person for their self. The most enjoyable part of the job was establishing relationships with other employees through training."

Pfizer,1dc28vjqq0mtt000,5.0,"The best thing was that we always had a different, experience or challenge every day of the things we had to do, fix or fabricate. And do different change overs of different filters and vessels, and machines."
Pfizer,1dbvhfhae24ft000,5.0,"I've loved working at Pfizer but after 35 years of faithful service, it's time to move on to something different.  My job experiences at Pfizer has been superior as my positions were always changing as my tenure advanced."
Pfizer,1dbu4hrntb88l800,3.0,I prefer to do this later for obvious reasons. The future of my career is on the line. I am sure you guys will understand my position at this particular time.
Pfizer,1dbq7uibs24gs000,4.0,"Nice lab, and well-equip laboratory. Opportunity to learn new techniques. Full-time employee enjoys a lot of opportunity. Contractors are limited to participate in many things in the company."
Pfizer,1dbp0mare24fp000,4.0,Great company to work. Leadership practices its core values to its true spirit. High respect for colleagues and work life balance. Meetings can be reduced and decision making can be improved.
Pfizer,1dbla5rub24gs000,4.0,Great company with wonderful benefits. Hardest part of the job is the physical labor. Great staff to work with and good management. Not much room for advancing.
Pfizer,1dbdr65s724fj000,5.0,I am very proud to work for Pfizer.  Their mission and drive to care for patients is astounding.  The companies flexible work schedule has enabled me to do both my job and take care of my family.

Pfizer,1dbc39in65na3800,5.0,Co-workers were excited about the work they were conducting in a fast faced environment. Management had a good balance between work and personal life balance.
Pfizer,1dbbd81f824gi000,5.0,Great job.  Nice place to work and great salary.  Good benefits and training was good.  Flexibility and room for advancing everyday and after the training raises were good.
Pfizer,1dbasauad24g2000,3.0,"Not very innovative in terms of putting its employees in positions to be successful; Organization tends to go through a lot of reorganizations and restructurings, always for the pursuit of efficiencies and being leaner - it never seems to accomplish what I believe they wish to accomplish with the restructurings."
Pfizer,1db9k23ri24gi000,5.0,"Well managed, great opportunity to succeed. Worked with a phenomenal amount of skilled and educated individuals who were very professional.  Opportunity to work on a multitude of projects."

Pfizer,1db3mmgdo52tk800,5.0,It was a great opportunity too have worked at Pfizer and all the other companies.  Each one contributes to my professional growth and knowledge. The working environment is very pleasant.
Pfizer,1db3c2a0024fj000,5.0,I worked at Pfizer for many years. Work life balance was very good. My ideas and suggestions were always well regarded and appreciated. We worked on many projects over the years.
Pfizer,1c8l1p5t21d1213m,4.0,"I think the site that I worked for had many unique issues.  The site had changed hands a good number of times, but not progressed very much in technology or systems knowledge.  Rather than bringing in new more efficient work flows, there was a tendency to keep the old way and add more levels of complication.  After coming from a company that was more innovative and open to change for better flow and efficiency, it was quite a stifling site.  The culture stayed the same because the people who stayed had little experience elsewhere and were opposed to change."
Pfizer,1db270s3m24f3000,1.0,Was not a job I would stay at I was racially profiled and had a hostile work environment that made me morally have to find a job that fit my work life balance
Pfizer,1db0o6ibe24gi004,2.0,"Pfizer is in the midst of trying to re-brand themselves as fresh and innovative, but nothing could be further from the truth. The nail that sticks out gets hammered down. Employees are disposable, salaries are stagnant/going down, layoffs are always around the corner, and management is extremely petty. Corporate meetings become opportunities to shill messages about keeping a ""can-do"" attitude and ""owning"" problems blah blah...then degenerate into HR kool-aid drinking parties. If this is your only job opportunity on the table I'd say go for it, but Pfizer's glory days are far in its past."
Pfizer,1db0nishj1d0j000,4.0,Pfizer started out as a great place to work but was quickly bought up by another company and things started to fall apart a bit during the transition.
Pfizer,1davfj6pih41t800,4.0,"Good place to work with a good ""Work-Life"" balance plus sound management teams. Great knowing that you're working for the largest global animal health company."

Pfizer,1dau7f9o5h41t800,5.0,"You must have experience in clinical or drug safety for Pfizer. Also, Pfizer requires their employees to have at least a BA degree. The work environment was great, and nice co-workers. The management team could use some training with helping employees when needed."
Pfizer,1datq9cg29r60800,3.0,"Excellent execution and operations, questionable development strategy."
Pfizer,1datpu8eph3to800,3.0,Many changes over 30 years that I worked at Groton. Pay was great for the area. Bonus program changes over the years improved but final change was to take 20% of salary away and force you to earn it back as a bonus
Pfizer,1das7pla7h41t800,5.0,"Amazing place to learn and grow. I miss the Pfizer culture, people and professionalism. NYHQ is one of a kind. At Pfizer, you are exposed to such talent and skills."
Pfizer,1das5jopjh3pn800,4.0,Overall I really enjoyed working at Pfizer. However like many places there were things I didn't enjoy like the factions that were in place. There were groups that promotions happened for quite often and others that were overlooked. With Corporate America comes many changes and there were reorganizations happening on a regular basis. These sometimes seemed to be done strategically as some people would survive their area being reorganized no matter how long they had been there and others were not so lucky. I know there are politics in every company and it's just a part of life.
Pfizer,1das49k5g5ndr800,3.0,It is a pain to drive 3 hour every day from my place to the company. The work place is really nice in a university. No food around so I have to bring the food everyday that I cooked.
Pfizer,1dapfldi35j54800,5.0,"Pfizer is a great company to work for.The culture and people are the best I've worked for. The goals are aggressive, but there are many resources to help meet your objectives. My DBM was the best boss I've ever had and my district team was amazing.  Total class!"
Pfizer,1dapaeaovh3pi800,4.0,Culture is tantamount.  I enjoy working for and with my team.  We all win together and that is a great motivator.  We have a dynamic team with varying levels of experience which makes for a rich work environment.
Pfizer,1daoojpb35ndm802,5.0,"I was an intern here. There wasn't a lot of work for me to do, but it was still enjoyable and management was really nice. Other interns had more work."
Pfizer,1dakoes7nb825800,5.0,"Great co workers and management.Pfizer was like a school to me,i learn so many things and how to be more prepare in a professional aspect.Good company to work."
Pfizer,1dajd5ffbh3pi800,5.0,The benefits were great and always good pay incentives. Good morale. Promoted a good culture. Loved the working environment. Management was great from my prospective.
Pfizer,1dai76kmmb862800,5.0,I had a very good experience working for Pfizer. I loved that job but had to leave due to husband's job. Wasn't able to return because we moved too much. Then we started a family and now the industry is completely different.
Pfizer,1dagvbcdqh3lh800,4.0,No longer a sales driven culture.  Professional but hard to get things done.  Risk averse company even though the OWN IT culture has tried to make a dent with this issue.  Very good benefits.
Pfizer,1da40ssimh3l3800,4.0,Typical day at work focused on productivity.  Education is also a big part of the Pfizer philosophy.  Pfizer provides all the tools necessary to succeed in the workplace.
Pfizer,1c8l1p5t21d1213m,4.0,"I think the site that I worked for had many unique issues.

Pfizer,1d9npsllm52sl800,4.0,"Pfizer provided good people, good environment with a clear passion for patients.  It was obvious that the patient was the main focus and the science supported ensuring that was pulled through at every facet. Leadership was fantastic, but environment was extremely competitive and ability to move up was limited."
Pfizer,1d9j7omsh5n95800,5.0,"Pfizer was a good place for me to work. I really felt that the company had my interests in view, especially with safety. Pay was reasonable. I was not there long enough to receive a raise but I think they were based from performance."
Pfizer,1d98askp1h40q808,2.0,"They want you to work 7 days a week in most departments. The St. Louis sites are barely able to produce product. And there is no growth within the company when you are union. It's the good ol boys club. Basically if you know someone that's how you move up in titles. There are completely to many manager positions. How can you be a manager and have no one under you. They give these titles out to give their buddies a pay raise. The union is struggling and they aren't able to find a consensus on even having a contract. They barely want to give raises. Simply said not a bad start, but I wouldn't definitely look for another job while working here. It's going down hill."
Pfizer,1d97uae9sh3sk800,5.0,"Challenging interactions daily, while being rewarded for those efforts. Ability to move up and be promoted. Relationships that are built will last a lifetime."
Pfizer,1d9721uk6h44j800,3.0,Always at work. Even in the snow. You got penalized for not coming time and a half . So If you missed 8 hours it counted as 12. Other than that a great place to work.
Pfizer,1d96fd7smh40q800,4.0,Great place to work. Workers are given opportunities for advancement. I enjoyed my coworkers and learning new skills. Overall a great place to work and learn new skills.
Pfizer,1d9517bcvh3kk800,5.0,I would recommend them to any of my friends. Their benefit packages are great. They also have the best cafeteria food I ever tasted. They have great chef at their disposal.
Pfizer,1d938bl6bh3sk800,5.0,"Enjoyed my time there would go back if given the chance, the pay was great and they have outstanding benefits. The people are very easy going and helpful."
Pfizer,1d92red9nh3sk800,1.0,"Pfizer (Carlisle) does not care about the employees, they only cared about the output of product for the day.  You could not go to the restroom or take lunch without management yelling at you.  Had to work 24/7, all holidays, and had to come in during snow storm and the roads were closed, you still had to be there.  They do not appreciate the work you do.  Management gets to leave whenever and you have to do their work for them so that it is done on top of your actual job and then they get rewarded for it not you.  You are running around all day doing your job because they run too many machines with not enough people.  Overall it is a terrible place to work and a terrible work environment and I would never recommend anyone to work there."
Pfizer,1d91n5jnib853800,1.0,Enjoy work with professionals Class A
Pfizer,1d8rjc4te0mch000,5.0,"Fast paced industry leader with lots of potential for growth, great networking opportunities, very invested in growth and development, comfortable lifestyle"
Pfizer,1d8opr3qt0kbh000,2.0,"Pfizer has a reputation of buying up companies then selling the manufacturing facilities to other companies, they want the products not the employees."
Pfizer,1d8muimm15nci800,3.0,My problem was more with the contracting company. Do not accept a position with Pfizer through Townsend and Associates.
Pfizer,1d8mg6gv824ev000,3.0,"I have come to learn over the years Pfizer tends to hire based on relationship vs. experience. The company is focused on doing the right thing for patients, but does not always put their best people first."
Pfizer,1d8kck7tf24fd000,4.0,Was a consultant working at Pfizer. My hours were 8 to 5 Monday through Friday. The culture was process driven and fast paced. It was a very professional environment.
Pfizer,1d8jqtpig24gt000,4.0,It was an okay position. I worked on the line as a production operator. It got kind of boring but the work is easy and the money is there if you are willing to work for it.
Pfizer,1d8gua6sq24fd000,3.0,Pfizer is located currently on midtown Manahattan (although moving to Hudson Yards in a few years).  It is a pharmaceutical company with both an innovative and off patent/generics business.
Pfizer,1d8bhmi7n24e9000,5.0,Great company and great people to work for. Wonderful management and great work/life balance.
Pfizer,1d883dhvtak8h800,3.0,"I was let go due to failure to following company policy, witch I was unaware of.I had informed my supervisor about a norther worker  falsifying documents, and then I had informed other people that I worked with, so they would be able keep there eye on that person,then management brought me in told me thanks for letting them know, but they were letting me go because of me violating  company policy. This is bad working policy, I know if someone is not doing there Job, I want to know, so I can keep a eye on them!!"
Pfizer,1d85oi1in0mta000,1.0,"The management sucked really bad! They did not care about their employees and no matter how hard you worked, they did not appreciate it. The supervisor would lie straight to your face and talk bad about you behind your back. I am glad I am no longer there!"
Pfizer,1c8l1p5t21d1213m,4.0,"I think the site that I worked for had many unique issues.

Pfizer,1d84hrmoq24f9000,3.0,"Great place to work with great colleagues while we were Wyeth.   Different culture with the change to Pfizer. No job security, work shifted to other sites."
Pfizer,1d83njcr424gp002,3.0,"Pfizer was efficiently, and professionally run. The management, from an efficiency standpoint, was second to none. This includes a production-line division of experiments as well as DOE-informed, comprehensive automotive screening."
Pfizer,1d81otqq00mtn000,4.0,Excellent place of employment.  Good benefits and a supportive culture.  Expectations are high but you are provided the tools and resources to succeed and have the support of management.

Pfizer,1d7vq6r9752ta800,4.0,"Good company to work for with opportunity for growth and development in specific fields. Pay is average and technical skill development can be limited based on the role."""
Pfizer,1d7vmfng752ta800,3.0,My day started very early to prepare for the morning meetings. I learned safety procedures and strict guidelines for a medical giant. The culture was in the beginning stages of equal rights and females in power.  The hardest part was getting all needed signature to complete my task.  The best part was the people and the proximity to my home at the time.
Pfizer,1d7vbospm24gl000,5.0,Everyone that worked here was so open to having interns make the place a little more youthful because we provided ideas that they hadn't thought of before.
Pfizer,1d7uukp491ahr000,2.0,"I was required to check mailing listings and work from there. I did not enjoy working at Pfizer. It was very mundane working atmosphere. With that being said, I did learn some things about a new department."
Pfizer,1d7uiihgg1bgc000,5.0,I truly enjoyed my time at Pfizer and was grateful for the opportunity to learn new things and keep up with current technology.  I worked with great people and learned so much.  My management was very supportive of me and challenged me to learn and do new things.
Pfizer,1d7s689q45j55800,3.0,"Pfizer payed decent for a first job out of college. I got the job through a recruiting company and that's exclusively how they hire in many departments. This prevents you from having any significant benefits and means you are giving up a portion of every check to the company that got you there. The management had gone through many shifts while in my 6 month employment there and the chain of command was obscure at times. The tools there are all very old and make the work unnecessarily tedious. The systems used to log any information are still performed in DOS if you could believe it and they have been ""attempting"" to upgrade their systems for years now with little improvement. Employees will have to perform testing with paper, then input the same information into these systems with miscommunication leading to unstandardized practice. Your coworkers may give you smiles but they will never stand up for you because every reprimanding nd critique feels like the last strike and nobody wants to lose their job. I literally never finished training in my 6 months there. I never had anyone with time to train me and spent about the first 2.5 months just bored out of my mind and pretending to look busy."
Pfizer,1d7l37uan0mt2000,3.0,"I started my employment in 1999. The company at the time was Genetics Institute. When Pfizer bought the company, the entire atmosphere changed. In 2016 Pfizer outsourced the Electrical, HVAC, and the boiler plant technicians. From that time on, the work environment just became stressful."
Pfizer,1d7l091h20mti000,4.0,"Pfizer is an enjoyable and professional place to work.  We accomplished a lot of our objectives domestically and internationally.  They have many perks for their employees, like an outside work-out facility."
Pfizer,1d7j9iq1h1ba1000,1.0,"Worked there for a short time as Quality Operation Professional. Typical workday was very stressful. I was expected to work over 50 hours a week. I was required to support remotely on my off days. Management required me to be available 24/7 over the phone. The worst part of the job was the bad culture, and mean local people. Local people are very clickish, and play dirty politics against any out of state people or people of colored who are rarely hired. Those local mangers and supervisors hire other locals from their church- very unprofessional. They will not cooperate with others who are not local or are colored. Hostile environment."
Pfizer,1d7i381ju24es001,5.0,My typical day at Pfizer would start at 7 am preparing to make my first calls or a breakfast with my health care providers at 7:30/8 am. I would make approximately 8-12 calls a day.
Pfizer,1d7fs8o585j51800,3.0,Very challenging atmosphere and pushed me harder then the military in some ways.  Great experience.  I loved all the trips I went on with the Company.
Pfizer,1d7faj4fu24eb000,4.0,This company makes its money from M&As  buys the assets and gets rid of the people.Overall the people working there are great.  Management attitude can use some help.
Pfizer,1d7au36cp1ai4000,5.0,The internship was great. The company has since spun off the animal health division which is now Zoetis. The management was good and the training and experience was valuable.
Pfizer,1d77tn3tr1ahj000,4.0,"I worked in three separate departments over three summers. All of them were very different environments with different job expectations and management styles. While most people were supportive and interested in helping you succeed, there was definitely a sense of competition and arrogance among the other interns. There was also a VERY strong corporate/business vibe (which may be expected, as it is a large company.)"
Pfizer,1d76klvid52t1800,5.0,"Great Company, my division was laid off in 2012 and I am interviewing for an Oncology position now, hoping to get back to Pfizer. The compensation is good, compared to Sunovion, Sunovion is great!"

Pfizer,1d757d20c1ah3000,5.0,"Great place to work as long as you and your supervisor are on the same page😉 Job satisfaction is largely dependent on a good working relationship with other Pfizer reps in your territory/division. As long as you are doing your job and consistently working hard, management makes every effort to help you meet and advance your career goals. Excellent opportunity for advancement- hard work is rewarded. Job training is top notch- I don’t think anyone else offers job training at this high level.  One downside would be that the large majority of newly hired sales reps are very young (recent college grads, early to mid twenty-something’s) who can lack experience /maturity in a way that can sometimes negatively effect their contribution to the “team player” environment Pfizer encourages."
Pfizer,1d755u9jj5j4u800,5.0,"I started working at Pfizer/Wyeth in 1988 and was laid off in 2002. It was the best job for me at the time. I started in the Filling Dept. as administrative clerk, advanced to the Accounting Dept. as a Accounting clerk, and ended in the Quality Control Dept. as a data base administrator."
Pfizer,1d735tilp52t1800,5.0,"I liked working at Pfizer, but my contract ended so I had to leave. If they had something that will come up for a permanent position I would apply for it."

Pfizer,1d6t4rnhj5ncu800,5.0,"I am Very Grateful of my time at Wyeth (later became Pfizer), the Management, culture and People overall made it a Great placed to work. I learned so much within Supply Chain, since they gave employees the opportunity of cross-training."
Pfizer,1d6t4m54t5ncu800,3.0,"The Company was an excellent place to work, unfortunately the Supply Chain Management possessed no People skills or respect for Colleagues, causing half of the staff between Production Planners and Material Schedulers to leave, including myself."

Pfizer,1d6pm661c24ej000,2.0,"The job itself is easy, but there is entirely too much overtime. Expect to be forced to work a 16 hr shift 10 mins before your shift is over. Expect to work 6 days a week and get only 4-6 off days a month. We use the truckers union which is beyond me."
Pfizer,1d6o6f7blak4s800,4.0,Great training. Prepared you for your experience in the field. Manager was very supportive. Always set you up for success. Marketing team provided us with the resources we needed in order to be successful.

Pfizer,1d6ljs27kakgp800,2.0,"The hardest part of my job was, dealing with a company that didn't care about their employee's. Very little communication between management and coworkers. What I learned while working with Pfizer/Hospira,  following Good Manufacturing skills, always abide by the Standard Operating Procedure's, doing it right the first time, every time!"
Pfizer,1d6ipeijk5j4q800,5.0,It basically is a workplace where you can work in the mail room or supply room. In the mail room we would sort out the mail and deliver it to all the buildings. In the supply room we open packages with supplies and sort them. We also ordered items that we were low on. We also did special orders on T Cards.
Pfizer,1d6hcm6jk24f3000,5.0,Challenging work but fulfilling.  On-site gym and emergency childcare on premises.  Company store allows you to have the opportunity to purchase products not in stores.
Pfizer,1d6gf2sdhaqgs800,4.0,Pfizer is a large company which there are tons of opportunities to grow within the same business. It's up to the employee to engage with their management to advance and explore other opportunities.

Pfizer,1d67fbt5l5nci800,5.0,- A typical day consisted of me leading a production crew to accomplish goals.
Pfizer,1d66njptnb84r800,5.0,"You could work however you wanted. You could choose to not speak to anyone today or spend the day relaxing as long as your deadlines were finished. This of course, didn't mean you didn't have things to do. Pacing is long but deadlines can be very rigid."

Pfizer,1d62i8u3124gv000,4.0,"I genuinely enjoyed my job for many years until recently. Many departments are now extremely understaffed and forced overtime is occuring on every shift of every day. While this is good for those who wish to work overtime, the overall morale of the site has tanked. Most colleagues are stressed out and regularly facing disciplinary action for refusing overtime. This is probably the main cause of colleagues quitting, which has been a problem lately."
Pfizer,1d61hr6tjas0k800,3.0,"I have liked working here but due to health reasons I can not do my job duties efficiently. I definitely appreciate the 3 weeks vacation that they give and the great health, vision, and dental insurance. Their 401k is great as well!

She didn't seem to interested in the lack of communication that lead to the end OR the fact that I walked around looking for the supervisors office so I can explain I DID NOT have my cell phone in a non cell area. They took the words of a couple of other temp employees that had been there...... What the other employees didn't see me do was, plug up my phone and leave it by the cooler where the phones are allowed and went back to my shift. Now my assignment is over all because of a lie, I DID NOT take my phone back to an unused area"
Pfizer,1d5mp2l0b0mtf000,5.0,Heavy calendar management and problem solving.  I learned to take minutes. Management in the Sales Department was great and the workplace culture was as well.

Pfizer,1d5eungr40mtv000,4.0,"I am very impressed with the management team at the Rochester site.  The site leader is very transparent and a hard worker.  He's very approachable and honest with his people and is very user friendly.  Unfortunately I am a contractor and at the time the site does not have the head count to hire me direct, the site leader was very honest about this however the contract company that I work for was not and unfortuantely I have to put myself back in the market in order to get better benefits.  Overall, I love being at the location just wish I could be direct for the benefits."

Pfizer,1c8l1p5t21d1213m,4.0,"I think the site that I worked for had many unique issues.  The site had changed hands a good number of times, but not progressed very much in technology or systems knowledge.  Rather than bringing in new more efficient work flows, there was a tendency to keep the old way and add more levels of complication.  After coming from a company that was more innovative and open to change for better flow and efficiency, it was quite a stifling site.  The culture stayed the same because the people who stayed had little experience elsewhere and were opposed to change."
Pfizer,1d523ob561d12000,5.0,"A great place to work in a fast pace environment.

One of the cleanest place to work. If had the opptiunty to go back and work for the full time i would."
Pfizer,1d4hdg4q1akd0800,1.0,"McPherson Kansas plant is a legacy Hospira plant. It does not represent other Pfizer plant. The plant is severely suffering by the bad culture, and lack of talent in management or in skilled job roles. Local peoples are only hired or promoted in management regardless of qualification. They do not allow better qualified people from out of state or from minorities to be promoted or hired in management or in high paying jobs."

Pfizer,1d47pps8fakd0800,1.0,The management is poor at the westport location. They treat the workers like children and expect no mistakes to be made. They threaten to write people up on a daily basis for minor stuff.oh yeah and if you become and inspector expect to take several tests thruout the year and many evaluations thru the year from people that dont know how to do the job. The union is a pure shitshow just like management. Its just a revolving door of people now. so much turnaround. I dont recommend this place at all. Im currently trying to get out myself. only good thing about this place is some of the people and the vacation time. Also expect to be forced to work most weekends. no work-life balance.
Pfizer,1d46nad4pakd0800,5.0,Good  pay  and  benefits.  I  was  made  to  feel  very  uncomfortable  for being  a  Caucasian  person  at  this  job. I  felt  targeted  and  ultimately  released  by this culture.

I had been given an offer to move with them but due to family ties in Chicago, could not take the job in NJ.Fond memories working with everyone."
Pfizer,1d3288c6q1d16000,4.0,I worked with a great team that gave more lots of opportunities to work on valuable projects. Advancement though is slow and not guaranteed. Lots of very smart people
Pfizer,1d31vlsri0mt7001,4.0,"Solid position with a lot of room for growth. The job can be performed at home, given you have collected the appropriate data and interviews. Workplace culture is tough and is not oriented towards teamwork, but in the end it makes you stronger for it."

Pfizer,1d2u2umm91ba7000,4.0,My summary said it all. If they dont change the mindset of management they wont make it. They will throw you under the bus to save their own behind. Management is not to be trusted.

Pfizer,1d2gibdqn1ai6001,5.0,"Working in the labs, you were generally offered a flexible work schedule. This made it nice for people who had families, or people like me, who would rather work early, rather than late. I was blessed with wonderful managers while I was there."
Pfizer,1d2e5mumt5n9g800,2.0,"If you are going through the temp agency you will be very much unpaid for all of the work you do. The people that actually work at Pfizer they help you out sometimes if you are in need, they do have really good teamwork but that is about it. You cannot miss any days. If you miss two days you are fired, even if you have a doctors note, death in the family. They want you to dedicate your life to them when they don't care about you. You do 12 hour shifts and they rotate throughout the week, throwing your whole life balance off. It rotates from days to nights, night to days. One week out of the month you have to do 72 hours with just one day off for that week. Like I stated earlier you barely have time for yourself bc you constantly work. If the machines are down you have to clean/mop until the machines are up, aint no telling when they will be up. A few times we literally cleaned for 12 hours, the entire shift. If you don't find something to do, even if everything is already cleaned, you will get snitched on. If you are deciding about working out there to just stay to yourself because the whole plant is just messy, just like to start mess and look for other jobs because this job will kick you to the curve without a notice. This job doesn't care about you nor your plans. They want you to work around their schedule and with some events such as doctors appointments and unexpected events it is hard."

Pfizer,1d264ouk3aqhc800,2.0,"Pfizer has a lot of money to spend, but their interest is in RX drugs. They buy companies and sell any division that does not have RX products.  You are a number not a name.  Management does not listen to their employees in order to improve the workplace, and they typically leave the current management in place for whatever company they buy."

Pfizer,1d1h8l09j5j52800,4.0,The company itself is a great place to work and has good salary and benefits.  Each department is a silo and only as good as its senior leader.  Some are good and some are extremely toxic and create other toxic middle managers which breeds a nasty cut throat culture.

For the most part, Pfizer has good management and quality employees and I've had the honor of working with some extremely talented individuals.  However, it takes a long time for bad managers/employees to be let go."

Pfizer,1crf36skm5nev800,1.0,"So this company is backwards from the start. As a technician with lots of experience in this industry I can honestly attest that Management does not care what you know, how hard you work, or about your ideas. They fill you with false hopes and dreams that the company cares about you as a person. First off, that is a lie. Management only cares about what makes them look good and does not make time for you as a person or an employee. They are cut throat, backstabbers, who only look out for themselves and will try and bully you to get what they want at the time. They NEVER thank you for what you do there daily, or how many hours YOU have to work. Remarks like "" well, your manufacturing and have no idea how difficult MY job is"" are made all the time. If your manufacturing your treated worse than manure. Layoffs, layoffs, and even more layoffs. These happen in companies but Pfizer seems to have them more than anyone else."

I learned so many things at Pfizer, but the greatest take away is to always work hard because that defines who you are as an individual in the work place.  Be reliable.  I am always able to count on my team members and in return I know they can count on me.  The hardest part of my job is working on projects with senior leaders and not letting this type of situation intimidate me.  I hold them to the same standard as I would hold anyone else and it works well when trying to execute a project by a certain deadline.  Pfizer has provided an enriching learning experience with hands on work, ability to network, and collaborate with individuals cross-functionally."

I was laid off unfair but seeing I was through manpower the management would not talk to me, he would not tell me face to face I was let go, he text me and told hr I was a no call no show."
Pfizer,1cps4o1mb5nab800,5.0,I believe that Pfizer is a wonderful company to work  I enjoy working at this company very much.   I have experience many academic sessions and good learning experiences.
Pfizer,1cps0vokraqhq800,3.0,Job security varied from year to year and multiple management changes occurred. The benefit package was the best in the industry however company pipeline was very weak when I was there.
Pfizer,1cpktdugj5j64800,5.0,"Flexible, good environment and good installations."
Pfizer,1cpfld1mibre2800,4.0,"If i get a chance to work with Pfizer again i will love to do it.and the best part was excellent work-life balance with top-notch benefits. The management team really seems to care about their employees. You may have to work late/from home sometimes when the company needs you to, but that is balanced with the ability to work from home when you need to."
Pfizer,1cpffccmh5na5800,5.0,"This was a great place to work.  Learned plenty of useful information from my colleagues that had been there for quite some time.  Gained lots of hand-on knowledge on all kinds of pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment, as well as some electrical construction."
Pfizer,1cpdp9d0l52u8800,4.0,"The teams are mostly divided between regular employees and temp employees.  You have to have years of experience before the regular employees take you seriously. Pay is good if you can tolerate the long hours, hard labour and  lack of consideration."
Pfizer,1cpck7nri5j5v800,5.0,"I worked with some of the most professional people in my career at Pfizer. Great company, great benefits, and work life balance! I'm still good friends with many of the people I worked with at Pfizer."

Pfizer,1cp7s2fkt5ne5800,5.0,Fast-paced work day using advanced technology with a great work culture.  Management of actual brands were great and would provide time to answer questions.  The lack of training from previous contractor was poor and left me on an island by myself before I had to self-teach myself processes.

Pfizer,1covr21ib52u7800,3.0,"Pfizer has a great deal of benefits and good pay. Although most of the colleagues there had no regard for teamwork and or didn't mind slandering your name and the inability to advance in your position was rather discouraging. Personally I felt stuck in terms of opportunities for a promotion and caused a lack of motivation to do more then I had to. Favoritism throughout the warehouse was a factor in this no matter if you worked harder then another person. Every week had the same routine with little work and mostly standing around ""looking busy""."
Pfizer,1couq16ml5j5s800,5.0,I was contracted to these companies to install a VBlock. I found the work environments very good. The management and employees were easy to work with. Everyone at these companies were very helpful.
Pfizer,1c8l1p5t21d1213m,4.0,"I think the site that I worked for had many unique issues.  The site had changed hands a good number of times, but not progressed very much in technology or systems knowledge.  Rather than bringing in new more efficient work flows, there was a tendency to keep the old way and add more levels of complication.  After coming from a company that was more innovative and open to change for better flow and efficiency, it was quite a stifling site.  The culture stayed the same because the people who stayed had little experience elsewhere and were opposed to change."

Pfizer,1comq6q0bakha800,4.0,I have learned a lot about distribution as well as EHS and DG from time here. There are great benefits and people seldom leave. I am only thinking about leaving because I have reached a limit in learning and earning potential and would like to have the opportunity to gain more.
Pfizer,1colclie752u4800,5.0,Pfizer is a great place to work.  There is a focus on the mission of the company and the opportunity to continuously learn.  Pfizer is a company that gives to others.
Pfizer,1coh7inr4b824800,5.0,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Pfizer but it was my first position out of college and felt I needed to expand my horizon. Awesome company to work for and work with.
Pfizer,1cogjges45j5r800,3.0,"Pfizer is a pretty decent place to work. The pay is good, but management could use a course in communication. Information is not passed along as well as it should be."
Pfizer,1coemdbpfak9t800,3.0,"I was charged with marketing and launching Viagra and Lipitor.  Also marketed Gucotrol XL, Zyrtec, and Accupril.  It was a good experience to market drugs that were so inherently different to such a diverse and different group of Specialists that had such different patient bases as well as treatment paradigms that you must figure out so you could find where your treatment could fit into that paradigm."
Pfizer,1coeccip5as1c800,3.0,Plant is not so bad as long as people from the area dont  in the higher managemnt. They dont let anyone educated or higher than their qualifications to take better positions.

Pfizer,1cobsf1ioak9p802,5.0,I left Pfizer because I relocated to another state due to family reasons and they did not have a presence in that location.  This company truly stays on message with their company's mission and treat their employees in excellent manner!  The work is incredibly rewarding and the level of talent in the organization is high!
Pfizer,1cobdknj75ndt800,3.0,"Good company, poor management. Tasks are not incredibly difficult, salary is competitive, good benefits and time off. Management is poor and human resources acts as part of management chain instead of an objective separate entity."
Pfizer,1co99kn765n9t800,5.0,"Nothing much to say, work is good, I learned alot as trials came my way, management was quite fair.  Pretty confortable job if you know what you are doing. Nothing to complain about."
Pfizer,1co94kq55ak5t800,3.0,"I work with an amazing group on the Supply Continuity Team.  We deal with very frustrated customer's that are desperately in need of major life saving medications that are currently out of stock, in limited supply or are being allocated. Our job is to do our best to assist them in understanding the status of each product and supplying them the product(s) they are needing if we are able."
Pfizer,1co8v1f4n5n9t800,1.0,"While Pfizer has great training requirements, it takes so long to be trained that it dimensions most value from the training. Overall the immediate management is very friendly and easy to work with, but higher up management became less concerned with people and more concerned with appearing to be innovative. they would refuse to give employees raises and promotions, but would spend hundreds of thousands into projects that were nothing more than busy work and would often result in the absolute minimal improvement. The turnover rate was extremely high and it was a combination of poor pay, location, and the fact they would hire 8 people and place them in senior positions before ever once promoting their current employees who spent years with the company. In my experience, work-life balance is completely non-existent; the location I worked from was roughly an hour commute for almost all employees in my area and everyone was pretty much required to work 9.5-10.5 hours a day."
Pfizer,1co8mlccq5j5n800,5.0,good place to work if you can get with company easy job to do  easy to get along with everyone. good management easy to talk to good pay good lunch breaks.

Pfizer,1co8dk3l7b89q800,4.0,Pfizer is a nice company to work.  It is big enough that it offers opportunities to grow in the company.  They are good at offering resources (i.e. engineering assistance) to a manufacturing plant to address challenges that may be to big to handle at the local level.  They are very organized and professional in the way they handle their business.
Pfizer,1co7ha7pjak5r800,4.0,I joined Pfizer when i was just a fresh graduate . i Think i was lucky enough to learn how pharmaceutical business is huge .

Pfizer,1co6hue2sakd6800,4.0,It pays well but like any large organization you are nothing more than a number.  They got kind of lax in their hiring practices.  Once again good place to work just not my cup of tea.
Pfizer,1co3dvrmn5j5m800,4.0,"Provided the opportunity to develop my understanding of how the Planning Department impacts production. I spent three years in a developmental role within the Planning Department. It allowed me not only to perform planning activities but to understand how roadblocks within this department directly impact production. Having the opportunity to understand this process aided me when I returned to production because it allowed me to be able to explain production delays and why they occurred, which improved the wage members knowledge and understanding."

A highly motivated, professional team culture made it easy for me as a highly motivated self starter to make the transition to pharmaceutical sales.  My manager was extremely motivating, professional, and highly intelligent.  The hardest part of my job was formulary obstacles but didn't deter me from getting our products used and minds changed due to better patient outcomes.  I really enjoyed my customers, my teammates, my territory (which was large) and that allowed me time to pre-call plan my messaging."

Pfizer,1cm5sv0sl5n94c1t,1.0,"I was not given enough opportunity to train in the myriad of softwares required to do my job at Pfizer. There was in fact an intense training protocol that sometimes eclipsed the actual work to be done.

I learned various skills and industry knowledge including internal audits and system processes. Management, at time, was lacking, but were always willing to learn and grow. Hardest part of the job was getting caught in a monotony spell if you didn't actively participate in work culture. It was also unfortunate that during my time there, production came before employees and occasionally their safety. There were many mixed messages of maintaining safety and but also keeping a high workload (cause for increased stress/error). Quality also took a minor hit due to such a high increase in workload."

Pfizer,1c8l1p5t21d1213m,4.0,"I think the site that I worked for had many unique issues.  The site had changed hands a good number of times, but not progressed very much in technology or systems knowledge.  Rather than bringing in new more efficient work flows, there was a tendency to keep the old way and add more levels of complication.  After coming from a company that was more innovative and open to change for better flow and efficiency, it was quite a stifling site.  The culture stayed the same because the people who stayed had little experience elsewhere and were opposed to change."

Pfizer,1cjri6lec1d03348,3.0,"My time at Pfizer was during the time that Warner Lambert was acquired. Prior to this it was a great place to work, people had great relationships both professionally and personally.

There are always opportunities for growth available. Pfizer encourages people to reach out to other groups to form connections. This place is amazing for people who want a chance to prove themselves and work hard to be competitive and learn all of the skills available, but you must thrive off of intense working environments to build a career here. Management structure is very well-organized; the managers I have met all care deeply about work/life balance as well as personal career growth of the employees. Overall, an excellent place to work for those who enjoy a constant challenge."

Pfizer,1ciuml58aas1290q,3.0,If you are skilled trades this is a great place to work but if you are in production it's terrible. Managers treat you very poorly. You are expected to work tons of over time including your days off. The work schedule is not conducive to having a life at all. Most buildings work at least 7 days in row and some as long as 19 days with 2 days off which you are told by management you should work. If you are a young person maybe it's a great job to make lots of money but for anyone who values their family time this is not the place to work.

Pfizer,1c8l1p5t21d1213m,4.0,"I think the site that I worked for had many unique issues.  The site had changed hands a good number of times, but not progressed very much in technology or systems knowledge.  Rather than bringing in new more efficient work flows, there was a tendency to keep the old way and add more levels of complication.  After coming from a company that was more innovative and open to change for better flow and efficiency, it was quite a stifling site.  The culture stayed the same because the people who stayed had little experience elsewhere and were opposed to change."
Pfizer,1c9g6b6sbaqjsbda,3.0,You can expect to feel like you have earned your pay here. There is a limited amount of advancement available and the advancement that is there are titles that come with little to no real meaning.

Pfizer,1c95t9c7p0kbi44u,5.0,"You must trust the process but it will eventually, slowly but surely, pay you back for your efforts and well executed work.

Pfizer,1c8qrthku5nfrea6,3.0,"I had a unique experience at Pfizer because I had a rookie manager who wasn't a good coach.  I longed for a manager with experience, who could improve a situation by being in it and offer advice and development opportunities for me as a new sales rep.  I learned to lead without authority in this role, partly because my manager had me lead many of our training sessions and meetings.  Pfizer is where I learned about migraine headaches and how to push through them.  The culture in general was a bit cut-throat.  The hardest part of the job was trying not to step on other Pfizer reps' toes (there were 8 of us in the same territory)!  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning what not to do if I became a manager in this industry.  Also, it's not a bad place to get your feet wet, but not one of my original teammates still works there."

Pfizer,1c8dgi6ku1ah069q,2.0,"They treat you like you are a number not a person. I don't think they appreciated the hard work that was being done. When your assignment was done they called you on your way home and told you. You weren't allowed to go back and get your personal belongs, they had security do that and it takes them approximately 3 week to get your belongings and sometimes you never do get your personal belongs EX. ( steel toed shoes in your locker.)."
Pfizer,1c8b750c7aqjgf4k,3.0,"A typical day consisted of arriving at work to discover an equipment failure had occurred on the previous shift.  Because it is a sterile manufacturing facility, production would be delayed for two or three hours due to re-sanitizing dwell time requirements.  Consistent failures led to days upon which shifts were sent home due to lack of work.  At the time of my departure, many people were pursuing jobs with other companies for fear the plant would shut down within a few months."

Pfizer,1c7u74t5k5nbj8pi,3.0,The company is great to work for. The benefits are nice and the pay is decent. However the big letdown is management. You will often run into situations where is feels like management is deliberately impeding your progress. Each shift is held to different standards. You have no where to go to voice your concerns so what ends up happening is morale starts to go down. If you approach the company with a minimalist attitude you should be fine but is you have aspirations for greatness then look elsewhere.
Pfizer,1c7t80tn8brfkd7c,3.0,I conduct assay runs and provide final results to my manager by end of week. I learned useful skills which can help to find the next job. The management is quite open-minded about new methods and that can bring the company to a new level.

Pfizer,1c7jpkebg5nfceco,4.0,Pfizer is subject to market pressure and an R&D pipeline that takes 10+ for a given product to go to market.  This puts pressure on the various budgets involved in R&D.  Reorganizations are fairly frequent and with that some jobs are made redundant.

Pfizer,1c7c6j9acakbmdlc,2.0,"This company is unfortunately in a bad area so I was commuting from Raleigh to go to work...took me about an hour one way. So obviously that is a big reason why I left but there were other reasons too. There are good leaders at the site but trust me not everyone is. I had a team lead who was basically like a supervisor who drove me to eventually getting out of there. Mostly what it seemed like she did was report on other people's work and when you tried to get her to help you, she usually wasn't too helpful. Usually when I went over to her desk to ask for help, she was either shopping online or messing around on facebook. And she would usually just tell me to go talk to someone else to get what I needed (anyone else could have told me that). She also had favorites and it was clear to see who was and who wasn't."

Pfizer,1c0aq0rju5ndfauf,2.0,"I'm not even sure where to start. First off, during your interview they are purposely vague about the company culture because it's absolutely non-existent. If you are a ""colleague"", as they call it, you have access to company benefits such as PTO, medical, and respect. But if you are a contractor you're subjected to whatever garbage benefits your agency offers, which are usually extremely expensive, if any at all. The divide between colleagues and contractors is almost scarily apparent right from the beginning. Being a contractor nothing you say is ever taken seriously and you're practically disposable and treated as such. The ""top"" management members have horrible communication skills. When an issue happens they are quick to point fingers and gasp in confusion but will seldom leave their offices on a daily basis to actually, you know, manage. They usually do an annual ""clean house"" which means that every so often they will fire 5-10 contractors for whatever menial reason they may find. Contractors have practically no room for advancement within the company because there's always the claim of a ""hiring freeze""; however, when a position magically opens up you already know who will or won't be considered for the position because it's based 25% on qualifications and 75% on favoritism. The position itself is really quite monotonous...You're either doing ECGs, drawing blood, sitting on the computer, or scanning badges in the cafeteria for 8 hours. There's nothing more that contractors are allowed to do within the building and you will not pick up any valuable skills or knowledge"

The site had changed hands a good number of times, but not progressed very much in technology or systems knowledge.  Rather than bringing in new more efficient work flows, there was a tendency to keep the old way and add more levels of complication.  After coming from a company that was more innovative and open to change for better flow and efficiency, it was quite a stifling site.  The culture stayed the same because the people who stayed had little experience elsewhere and were opposed to change."
Pfizer,1bj90o64g1bg929s,4.0,I do not feel it is necessary to comment extensively on this former employer. They were good to me and I had a great manager. Super benefits. . That is all

It is the best company I have worked for so far, do your job and nobody will bother you. The hardest part of the job has to be all the free food and celebrations we have because you end up gaining about 20 lbs within the first two or three months.

SUEZ,1e3vl1s53o21u803,1.0,"At least in my role, there was no work life balance.  At one point in time I was only allowed to leave my desk to use the restroom.  I was carrying three poeple's workload and never received a promotion.  Employees at that company lied, they manipulated my emails and my supervisor never did anything about it. After I carried him the entire year, I all of a sudden became a bad employee in october right before raises were submitted.  I couldn't even take my vacation that I earned over the years."
SUEZ,1e2ruo4q032n2002,3.0,"Pay can be better, work can be a handful at times . Requires a Clean Driving record and ability too communicate with Customers often etc etc etc etc etc"
SUEZ,1e1krd027f0a5803,4.0,"Was worth working there for five years, they have great benefits and try to help you the best they can. The work is easy to grasp on to and you do basically the same thing everyday."
SUEZ,1e1i87rqaolq3803,3.0,"There will be little rubs and disappointments everywhere, and we are all apt to expect too much; but then, if one scheme of happiness fails, human nature turns to another; if the first calculation is wrong, we make a second better: we find comfort somewhere."
SUEZ,1e0tqfgano1up802,5.0,"Good work environment, lots of management turn over. Good benefits and compensation. Training and advancement opportunities available. Friendly co workers"
SUEZ,1e0bkkblno9mp802,2.0,"Overall, no room for advancement minimal cost of living raise no merit raises, without a degree you will be stuck in the same position forever. Huge lack of communication between departments."
SUEZ,1duog7cqc25jq002,3.0,Decent company they promote with in a lot and give good raises and bonuses. They give a vigorous work schedule but reward hard work well. I would recommend this company for sure!
SUEZ,1duc16j2l0gvs003,3.0,"I didn’t feel like I was supported as much as I should of been, I also felt like the current management did a lot of pinning employee job roles against each other and didn’t feel like there was a sense of working as a team culture"
SUEZ,1dsvob3ejp04r803,1.0,"If you have a degree, they value you. If you didn't get a degree, you aren't valued and aren't considered for any type of advancement. Office staff are often stuck in roles for YEARS."
SUEZ,1dsmttu3f33nu006,5.0,"Clean & neat place to work, Always learning new environmental techniques and regulations for achieving permit regulations and goals. Career opportunities offered at day one."
Sprouts Farmers Market,1du619uh84eif802,4.0,I picked Vitamin clerk because I enjoy this subject to the utmost. It is inspiring to me to help customers with their health goals. I provided neat and tidy shelves. Up to date products and information to my customers.
Sprouts Farmers Market,1f7uh3408u1m4800,4.0,I loved my job at Sprouts for a season. The unfortunate thing about being competent is that people will attempt to take advantage of your time. Management will respond and respect you if you work hard.
Sprouts Farmers Market,1f7qp0dteu1m4800,4.0,I work my way up in the company from a clerk to a manager over the past five years and as you grow in the company the pay increases and it’s a great place to work especially if you’re looking to advance in retail
Sprouts Farmers Market,1f7k9fcbhnq24800,4.0,Nice company to work for. everyone was nice at the store. the hiring process was a little complicated i did not like the text service they had for looking for employment. Wasnt my kind of work so i left
Sprouts Farmers Market,1f7jpk9uuu3hk800,4.0,"Great place to work for a student or someone not needing to support themselves on the below minimum wage pay. As long as you come to work and do your job its easy, management is awesome. Terrible benefits if there for under 1 year."
Sprouts Farmers Market,1f7je60qto20r800,3.0,Fair pay and okay culture. The benefits for full time are adequate. However there is a massive turnover rate. In my time there were 11 department managers and 5 store managers in 3 years.
Sprouts Farmers Market,1f7jchuboo20r800,1.0,I would recommend not applying and save yourself the time and headache of this place. Management is horrible and the atmosphere is garbage. Nobody cares about their job. Very understaffed and it all falls on employees to pick up the slack manager will never help you succeed because they don't know how to themselves.
Sprouts Farmers Market,1f7h9f2j1o1nd800,2.0,"Worst regional and ability to support and help his stores. Was the acting store manager for a short time and in that time realized how little he knew and how poorly he treated his store managers. There is a reason that the Washington stores all keep their store managers for 6 months or less before they move onto more respecting and supporting careers, including myself."
Sprouts Farmers Market,1f7h836ecu2ud800,1.0,"Store and upper management give you little to no resources, and do nothing to help. The few new people that get hired quit within weeks because of poor work conditions and aggressive management not giving them the time to learn the job. Constantly out of supplies and trash is left to pile up for days while they wait to get the compactor dumped."
Sprouts Farmers Market,1f7cl3kmqu2ud800,3.0,This isn’t a terrible place to work. Got to learn about how a grocery store operates and how to retain skills to be successful in said business. Every work place has drama but at my store it was like working in a real life “Days of Our Lives” episode
Sprouts Farmers Market,1f7av8ff4o1nd800,4.0,Easy job but you will get rude uptight customers. This company went above and beyond with precautions for COVID. Not a bad job for part time or anyone who needs a flexible schedule.
Sprouts Farmers Market,1f79klcm4t3q7800,2.0,"It was an okay job, but at the location I worked at was very weird and kind of off putting. My job honestly felt useless, because I spent all my shifts ""facing"" the grocery aisles, I rarely got to stock which was what I wanted to do. Management would act as if the entire store depended on what I did, which made me feel very guilty and pressured. My coworkers were friendly, but I did not like the environment."
Sprouts Farmers Market,1f780fdtfu2ki800,1.0,"I’ll just say sprouts is a Terrible place to work . No hours. Underpaid , Store manager is a joke to work under would give 0 stars if I could . I was with the company less than a year and I can say it’s the worst job I ever had . I was forced to work 12-15 hour days or loose my job every other week . Made to come in on my off days to satisfy upper management. Only positive was pay . But even then they did not pay enough for how the made you feel . Nothing is ever good enough. I will not be going back or shopping at Baton Rouge location ever again"
Sprouts Farmers Market,1f77qcijlo290800,1.0,"I’d never recommend this job to anyone, the pay isn’t worth the mental stress they put you through such as mental abuse and they throw around all the products they get anywhere, my first day being there they pushed me around and never explained anything to me"
Sprouts Farmers Market,1f752teqm31ha000,3.0,"There are a lot of products to learn, order and face within the Vitamin department. It can be a challenge to get it all done perfectly, which is the expectation. Schedule can be unpredictable, depending on the department manager, which makes planning your life a challenge. The pay isn’t great and there can be stress."
Sprouts Farmers Market,1f733guiqo1dh800,3.0,It was cool. Nothing really much to say but I will say a few things. Nice and good facility. People were sometimes rude and annoying. The store was very spacious
Sprouts Farmers Market,1f71jldtkhijp800,3.0,It's just a typical job.  If you need a little income then that's ok but I wouldn't expect a lot of advancement in the future.  If you're not hired as a manager don't expect to be a manager.
Sprouts Farmers Market,1f71eki9ms7es800,4.0,"No guarantee on hours, the raises are extremely low, it is corporate after all. The managers were really chill and so were my coworkers. Its more so corporates in general. The 15% discount is nice but could be more. The company was really good when covid first started. They gave us bonuses (you get taxed on it)."
Sprouts Farmers Market,1f71d2e4931ha000,3.0,Constantly working understaffed yet succeeding as a company. Corporate SUCKS. Things are constantly changing. Even though I’m technically full time little to no benefits. If you’re not a lead don’t expect an ounce of credit for all the work you do.
Sprouts Farmers Market,1f716po3mo1dh800,2.0,Don’t bother working for Sprouts unless you wanna be treated like trash by management. They don’t care about their employees and you are either overworking or underworking and pay isn’t great neither
Sprouts Farmers Market,1f6qvlm8r3obs000,4.0,Great coworkers. Miserable managers will treat you as they view the world..in a miserable way. After working through the COVID year and helping make the store thousands of dollars in profits every week I received a raise that should have made me quit on the spot with how pathetic and insulting it was.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1f7u5bvklu1m4800,4.0,"Fun workplace with passionate co-workers. If you love pets and helping pet owners, this is the place for you. However, you must have passion for it because the pay is not there."
PetSmart,1f7r1er0qhihn800,3.0,Work hard paid not so hard. Not easy to advance and if you do you are over worked. Trading commission is okay but only if you can sell tons. A lot income store doesn't do that
PetSmart,1f7pqfrvct53t800,3.0,"My time here was super slow paced and everyone just seemed like they just wanted to go home, which is valid. Employees were occasionally nice but overall it was depressing."
PetSmart,1f7p8t1r5u23e800,4.0,"The Culture Petsmart has created is great. I felt welcomed and had an overall good time in the DC. Pay is good, they were very flexible with me going to school. I had no real complaints."
PetSmart,1f7p050g3o25r800,2.0,"The coworkers and managers will talk behind your back. Tips are okay, most of the coworkers would belittle you or make you feel incompetent. They would schedule you without telling you and get mad you didn't show up. Its okay but be prepared to do more work and yelled at for not being ""fast enough""  don't be ontime but 5 minutes early"
PetSmart,1f7ouc713u23e800,3.0,"Overworked and underpaid sums it up. I enjoy working with the dogs. I just started out about a month ago as a bather and will be attending the grooming academy, hopefully. I wasn't aware that I would have to give up every weekend to work and plus closing at all times."
PetSmart,1f7n33kg0sa3c800,3.0,This was a nice start to my career working with animals. The basic training provided for animal care was sufficient and helped guide me to more focused animal welfare efforts.
PetSmart,1f7l33q2lo14k800,3.0,I did not like working there because of the way they treated the small animals. Staff was cool. But the birds and fish were not treated the best. It was om for a starting job
PetSmart,1f7ko1uujhirt800,3.0,"The job itself isn't too bad, but the only thing leadership cares about is making money and keeping customers. Not all managers care about their associates and the ones that do are few and far between. No matter what a customer does, if they complain to the manager or corporate they get what they want"
PetSmart,1f7hb5uhu3kis000,3.0,"I feel that corporate doesn't understand the needs of the store with the hours given to us. we usually close the store with 3 people and this is ok sometimes. However over the past year it has not. During the evening shifts we often on busy days only have 3 people on in the store with one cashier, one leader and one pet care associate. I order to provide the best customer service the leader is forced to chose whether to become back up cashier, help customers or help in pet care when they are backed up. Our customers reflect their experience with this in customer surveys."
PetSmart,1f7h59v4pt3q7800,2.0,"PetSmart wants to pay you the minimum and then give you every task known to man. Someone called out? Too bad. Figure it out without them. Didn’t get everything completed due to lack of staff? Too bad, here’s your write up. Need to call out because your legitimately sick? Get over it and get to work. You tested positive for covid? Well why’d you come to work sick? Because you made me!! I seriously cannot stress to you enough... there are not enough words in the English dictionary for me to explain to you and caution you on how awful company is and how it drains you of every spark of energy that you think you have! And then they wanna play the whole “make associates feel like they belong” .. “we care about you and your health” .... Total front. Not to mention the lack of support. You’ve got one person over here with their head so far up the SL’s cheeks that you’re unsure of which one is actually the SL. Another one over here busting it, while that person over their is getting all the credit. Just don’t. Don’t apply. I’m gonna stop now. But I could go on for days."
PetSmart,1f7fkt30tu2ud800,2.0,"It's fun to play with dogs at PetsHotel but unfortunately Petsmart is very bureaucratic with too many policies that get in the way of common sense, leading to high turnover."
PetSmart,1f7fbkncft3q7800,2.0,"When I began at Petsmart 10 years ago, it was a great place to work. But this gradually changed to what it is now: a place where the store and services employees are treated like chattel, while upper management at the home office in Arizona issue decrees from on high that aren't in line with in reality. Store and services workers are expected to perform an ever increasing amount of work with less -- less pay, less labor hours allocated, and less support."
PetSmart,1f7cr9uj2o1nd800,1.0,"The supervisors and team leads are clicky and don't let anyone they don't like succeed. They change their opinion about agents within a day and will randomly pick people to abuse their power. You might be sitting with a team of 18 people and then the next day 9. Quality Assurance and other parts are bogus for the most part and can't actually help the agents grow. They let people work from home in waves when the pandemic first hit because they didn't fund enough equipment in preparation. and they made some of us stay for like 3 months into it all, also the people chosen to work from home were not picked based on performance or tenor, but rather favouritism (THE WORST PART) and barely any compliance with social distancing. I had other people around me who literally just got done traveling across state within 14 days and I got covid from them. When I told them about my concerns they brushed it off every time with a ""yeah... unfortunately that's just how it is [*Smiley Face* :)  if it was an IM just to be even more petty.] And also because its like company protocol to have no expression of worry and a ""CAN DO"" attitude the whole time even when just casually speaking to peers on break. Not really a ton of room to move up and if you mess up once on like your first day, you have to wait like 6 months to have that problem removed from your account."
PetSmart,1f7cpbqgqt3q7800,4.0,The store is great my dogs loves to go there and the people are nice and you guys have lots of food brands and toys that I love and they love to I like cats to and …
PetSmart,1f7cjvgfit3q7800,3.0,I worked here in college and it was okay. My manager was okay but the pay was minimal and my raise was 25 cents...which is ridiculous. Customers were nice. There didnt seem to be much culture at my store.
PetSmart,1f7c7tm6st3q7800,5.0,I absolutely love working here. I worked at another big retail store before transferring to the life of pets and I cannot express enough how much happier I am now!
PetSmart,1f7atrssfo1nd800,3.0,"the job is relatively easy; being a cashier, stocking shelves, and a heavy focus on customer service. customer service/getting sales is their biggest priority. don’t get sick and call out, or they’ll get upset."
PetSmart,1f79m0gs7t3q7800,4.0,"I worked in the PetsHotel area of PetSmart and I can say it was quite fun. You get to work with dogs and sometimes cats but it kind of sucks cause you have to clean all the gross stuff but after awhile you get used to it. The managers made sure you had your break and there is room to grow! I was almost promoted (at the time I only worked for a few months) but then covid came so that blew right out the window. One big con is that the managers and team leaders had no back bone. If there was a serious issue with an employee they would barely do anything. Or if someone wasn’t doing their job right, they would say something one time but that was it and then get mad when the employee would do it again but still they wouldn’t do anything about it. But other than that still a decent job."
PetSmart,1f77id3gphijp800,3.0,"At first working here was ok, however I quickly learned that every one else was making more than I was and getting a raise is close to impossible. Made me bitter about going the extra mile and not getting any recognition for it. I was a petcare specialist, however they often would put me to work on the register which no one wanted to do. Also management would often make “jokes” or degrade petcare staff making it seem like their job was easier than it was. The only good thing about this job that I can think of it was that it was easy to call out of/get days off or people to cover for you."
Craft Health,1eh6bddbrrasm800,5.0,Really enjoy my job and the different people I get to work with. Love my supervisor and the clients I care for are wonderful and give me a sense of purpose.

Craft Health,1dir4di3a0000al3,3.0,Conscientious leadership who attempt to balance clients and staff needs.  Home Health Care is always a challenging area to work in and this company is able to manage this difficult line of endeavor better than several other companies but this is still a difficult line of work and is not for everyone.
Craft Health,1diqrub040000cc2,5.0,This job has really helped me develop my professionalism while going to school and working. The managers were very flexible with my availability and worked with my when it came time meetings. I appreciate everything this company has done for me while I make my next move towards my goals in the Healthcare industry.
Craft Health,1diqqmk9u0000bsf,4.0,Great place to work! Typical day is driving to clients houses and helping them with chores and errands as needed. Worst part is the wear and tear it puts on your car. Best is schedules are MADE to fit what you need AND can easily work for college students.
Craft Health,1diqi40et0000aa7,5.0,There is nothing about Family Home health that I can complain about. Management and our office team is beyond helpful and phenomenal. They are very quick to help out when something doesn’t work or isn’t on our care plans.

Craft Health,1dimio4g20000fpa,5.0,I love working for Family Home Health. I feel valued and respected as one of their CNA's. I enjoy the CE learning modules the company provides. The best part of the job are the company owners. They are supportive about having a work life balance and throw us the best summer picnics and holiday parties. The CEO is very active in our day to day operations.  Joe is very knowledgeable. He knows the ins and outs of everyone's role and can helps us from technical issues to understanding the medical billing manuals.  The HR Manager is amazing. She works on your concerns or issues immediately. The hardest part of the job is that their is so much work/need to do and not enough of us!
Craft Health,1dimhbk1q00008rm,4.0,Working with Family Home Health it's good because I can be at home taking care of my own CHILD.  As a parent I don't have to worry about sharing this responsibility with others.
Craft Health,1dim5ci7t00009tr,2.0,"I work as a respite provider for children with developmental disabilities whom I know from other programs. Once you get used to FHH's system it's not terrible, but it's very difficult to schedule.

Craft Health,1d5sp1h4maqgl800,5.0,"I have enjoyed working with Family Home Health since the day I was hired. The work is well-organized by the office staff and they are very flexible with giving one any necessary vacation/sick days one may need. Hours are completely up to you. Documenting with tablets, though hard to learn at first, is a very nice bonus and allows for independence in one's work."
Craft Health,1crofhc2baqii800,1.0,"i was way underpaid, they only care about themselves, they are a very weird family, they don't communicate, and if they do, its to blame you for a huge problem that you tried to prevent by speaking to them"
