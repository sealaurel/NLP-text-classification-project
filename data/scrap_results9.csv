King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."
King Soopers,1f7pupln4u28m800,2.0,"Working in the front end can be pretty hectic, we are usally always unstaffed and the headclerks that run the front end are good but the upper management in this store is poor and they dont care about any of the employees they hire."
King Soopers,1f7elgri4u26j800,4.0,There is a clear separation between part time and full time workers. Which can be either a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it. My only piece of advice is to strongly voice your opinion to HR or management otherwise they will not notice you or respect you.
King Soopers,1f7cfqkjju2ud800,4.0,"For people looking for a basic summer job. This is great. If you want a career, there are opportunities. You start at minimum wage. But you get regular pay increases. Full benefits are available. There are a lot of long term dedicated employees who have superiority complexes. Management is a little too micromanaging. The stores are always understaffed so you’re constantly bouncing around departments."
King Soopers,1f78o1mbhu2ud800,1.0,"I wouldn't recommend them to my worst enemy. The upper management sit upstairs all day as they cut everyone's hours and demand no over time, yet your in charge of doing 3 peoples jobs. If you don't get that much work done, they wrote you up because couldn't finish all the work."
King Soopers,1f724tqmahijp800,1.0,Want to work multiple jobs for terrible wages? Do you want a job where there are no opportunities to advance? Do you like your coworkers talking about you behind your back? Do you like the underside of your bosses boots? Are you a masochist? Work at King Soopers.
King Soopers,1f71c0sua3obs000,2.0,"It's a corporation, it will chew you up and spit you out. It was ok until I got promoted to full time. I was forced to give up almost all off days and even then it was never enough. Worked sick, exhausted and stressed out and not one person in upper management gave a care, they just expected more."
King Soopers,1f6qhnj6h3obs000,2.0,"I was training to become a manager and went above and beyond for 2 years when a new front end supervisor transferred to my store and brought an entire new front end management staff. Instead of getting the promotion I was promised, the new manager gave my position away to a friend of theirs that had transferred to our store. This person was promoted with no formal training or effort. I had undergone countless hours of training and even had to travel to other cities to take management classes, but I was pushed aside and given no explanation. If you aren't friends with the managers, you will not advance."
King Soopers,1f6o4u2p7hijp800,2.0,"Not necessarily a hard job, or a bad place to work. Management is fine generally, but of course your manager is just the first in a endless bureaucratic chain, so getting real ideas for change to people that can implement it is difficult. Like any retail job the simultaneously best and worst part is the customers. And since its a grocery store a very wide net of people gets cast. This job definitely has made me appreciate jobs I have had at more mom and pop type companies because there is just a better cohesion and focus of quality work culture."
King Soopers,1f6fqhc7r3ocs000,3.0,"King Soopers is a work focused environment at all times. They will start you off on your main job but will ask you to learn other departments. Covering another department became a typical thing. Not everyday, but often enough. The very top management were great and understanding, while the more day to day management were strict and callous. The hardest part of the job was working both a night shift and a day shift in a row. Happened a few times which got me physically ill at one point. What was enjoyable about the job was how clear what you needed to do. The simplification of what needs to be done was the only enjoyable part of it."
King Soopers,1f5tnneiuu3af800,2.0,"I recently turned in my notice after working only 1 week. I sensed the ""who cares about you and your life"" attitude straight away. I was mislead during my interview process, so I quit. I am 46 yo and past the point of his school fuckery. I would not recommend working for this company unless you enjoy being exploited. You will soon fall into the culture of ""well, since my employer doesn't care for my wellbeing,  I don't care either"". It's an extremely disconcerting situation. The kicker is, I really enjoyed my actual job, the ""real"" position I agreed to upon hiring. In short, don't waste your time."
King Soopers,1f5tboo9hu4lu800,1.0,Depending on your store management sucks. They don't care about you or your life. Call you in everyday you have off. Pay is little to nothing for what you have to do. Lowest paying grocery store as well.
King Soopers,1f5rvrlipsaai800,3.0,Good pay once you top out.
King Soopers,1f5lpu2tvu4lu800,3.0,"I worked in several departments at King Soopers, e-commerce, front end, and floral."
King Soopers,1f5jnb69mu2n1800,4.0,Good job that has a good environment to work in. The coworkers are great and make it a family atmosphere. The pay was good and so were the benefits. Overall nice place to work.
King Soopers,1f5j3e8ddu3af800,3.0,Customers are ungrateful. It doesn’t matter what you do it’s never enough. It’s frustrating. The beat part of working there is the friends you meet on the job.
King Soopers,1f59pu710u2n1800,1.0,"Very physical during the summer. Management does not cater to flexible schedules (i.e. if you have a commitment every week like church, they will not help you to make your schedule not conflict with that). Poor training."
King Soopers,1f59hqof8u3af800,2.0,Negative work environment the older people don’t want younger people to be in management because they don’t want younger people telling them what to do. Management does not care or want to help you with anything. And if you get promoted you are thrown to the wolves and will not get the help you seek. The old people go against the younger generation and the younger generation isn’t paid enough to work harder then the older generation. Bad company
King Soopers,1f56f9t93saai800,2.0,"Management was awful. was unfairly demoted. Was lied to about accommodations and told ""oh well"". This place is only worth it if you can stick it out for 10 plus years."
King Soopers,1f568dnv6u2n1800,1.0,"You wanna be treated terribly on the daily?Then boy I have the place for you! Not only will customers walk all over you, but management treats you like youre dumb, even though you most likely know the job better than they do! And you're supposed to take it! We are constantly overworked, understaffed, and underpaid. This company just keeps getting worse and worse in the years I've wasted here and they keep adding more for you to do while slashing hours every where they can, making it impossible to finish your job. Then they yell at you for not being good enough. This place can barely call itself a job, maybe a good place holder while you look for a new job. Please. Don't work here."
King Soopers,1f51g7cicu3af800,3.0,"Continually cutting tech hours despite large workload and always asking staff to do more.  This is pretty typical of retail pharmacy though.  Pay and benefits are great, especially for managers."
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."
King Soopers,1f4j1kvv2u392800,4.0,Decent company and can place you in various roles is your current doesn't suite you. Great place for college or younger age students to work because of flexibility.
King Soopers,1f4f4o3c1u39f800,1.0,The pay is the only thing keeping me here...
King Soopers,1f3s80c7ou1vt800,2.0,I’ve worked at 2 different stores. First one felt close knit and fun. Second one felt hollow and soulless.
King Soopers,1f3jm3868u3dj800,4.0,King soopers is a good place to work at in all honesty. Not too difficult as long as you're okay with social situations because you do need to talk to a lot of people. Your work will be what you make it. As long as you keep your head on right you'll be fine. The pay could be better and management does their best.
King Soopers,1f3ik5nn3u3dj800,2.0,Never worked in such a negative and hostile environment before. Management honestly does not care about employees. Associates are constantly threatened with transfer/termination for simply not being able to work overtime. People are told that their responsibilities as a parent are not a valid excuse to leave when scheduled to get off.
King Soopers,1f35cv5ib3ki8000,3.0,Amazing.....great company. Good reputation.......pay can be better. Over all it's pretty incredible... So far.....fingers crossed ..... Good times!!!!!-
King Soopers,1f2pdsia6u1v3800,4.0,"I love the location,  and the work I do here.  However the expectation aren't within reach of any individual that is having health issues or simply aging. They have unreasonable expectations of their night crew and not enough for their day crew.  While I struggle to make cases per hour at 45yrs old the recieving crew and department managers smoke out front or in the back of the building every 20-30 minutes.  They also play favorites within departments and promote the person who talks and not the person working their butt off. This company has absolutely no loyalty values...."
King Soopers,1f2a2lie9him2800,3.0,It is fast paced and can be challenging in some areas. Overall being able to great customers is the best part. I am able to make sure the customer gets what is asked and make sure they’re satisfied.
King Soopers,1f21s4njdu1v3800,2.0,"If you are an hourly employee, they want to incur no overtime, which makes sense but also makes it difficult to make a living."
King Soopers,1f1v8ta89u3hv800,2.0,It’s a minimum wage job so you’re worked like a dog for little pay. Not allowed to accept any sort of tip for walking out groceries or anything like that. The parties are nice but it’s rare.
King Soopers,1f1lfu0r9u3hv800,1.0,"Truth be told it varies between and among different stores, my home store was fine, i got along with my crew and managers, but at my current store the management in my department needs some serious work. The store in and of itself needs work."
King Soopers,1f1ipq7niu40q800,3.0,"Easy job to learn and do, like most entry level positions. The job gets repetitive pretty quickly though because you're just going around picking up groceries for people for the majority of your shift. Most of the coworkers are easy to get along with, but they are also mostly just kids or new hires."
King Soopers,1f1ikfn3ou3hv800,3.0,Great company if you're looking to rise fast. They reward intelligence and obedience.
King Soopers,1f0h5tb7un54g800,1.0,This place is a joke and the union isn't much better. The culture is toxic and promotes a cult like atmosphere of fear and control. There are much better places to invest your time and energy.
King Soopers,1evtnlib7u1sg800,5.0,Was a great job. Job stability. Room for advancement. Highly stressful most times but doable. Will move you to other stores without your permission.....
King Soopers,1evt05320n52h800,3.0,"King Soopers isn't for everyone. Front end requires good customer service skills including patience and understanding. Grocery requires being able to work effectively without supervision. The pay isn't great if you don't already have experience, and the time worked promotions are small and infrequent. It's a good first job, but it's not a career unless you become management or are willing to become a certified pharmacy tech."
King Soopers,1evr5gmun26a4000,2.0,Typical retail pharmacy.  I guess it's not any better or worse than any other retail pharmacy these days.  When I started there it was great with lunch breaks and 8 hour shifts.  Those are in the past though
King Soopers,1evd03l2l26ak000,2.0,"I don't know where to start with this company. The time clock is finnicky and rarely lets you clock in properly, management is passive-aggressive and difficult to work with, and schedules are released last minute most of the time. Although I was offered a full-time position, I later realized I was lied to and given a part-time position."
King Soopers,1evcpqk0jn55l800,3.0,Basic retail job. There is lots of turnover so you will be working with new people regularly.  Managers don't last long so don't get too comfortable with them.
King Soopers,1ev9btc9j26ak000,5.0,"There is always people going in and out of kingsooper, so there is.alot of customer service. There was always amazing people to work with. I always enjoyed going to work"
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."
King Soopers,1ev5qtuu226ak000,3.0,"I am in e-commerce. I shopped one round with someone who had only been there a month, and then I was left on my own. Most things I learned after the first hour I learned by getting reprimanded for not doing it “right”. Everything else, I either asked to be taught or just paid very good attention. Thanks for the training “management”."
King Soopers,1euvt344u26ak000,1.0,"Where to begin. King Soopers, in their hiring add boast of great benefits,  excellent training program, flexible hours. This is as far from the truth as is possible. There is no training program whatsoever, the less than average benefits packages are way below standard for a company of King Soopers massive size and you can't get time off to take care of your health concearns anyways. The hours n schedules are never ever flexible. Another drawback is that King Soopers only hires part time and will do everything they can I believe to keep employees at a part time basis as to avoid paying health benefits and or at a higher full time rate. Part time people I have experienced had a minimum of 3 years, and some over 5 years at part time level wanting and applying for full time at every opportunity. Management are unfriendly and care about only one thing n that's BONUSES riding the backs of their employees more often than not leaving them short handed, over worked, and underpaid."
King Soopers,1euvpbidi26ak000,5.0,The King Soopers family is an excellent place to work the people are great the customers are great everything about the job is fantastic to me however at 47 years old I am unable to support myself and live in my own apartment which is kind of a requirement that I have it’s a great place and I would really love to stay there but financially I am unable to do so
King Soopers,1euud4tg5n55l800,5.0,A pretty good place to work overall. Really enjoyed my job! Worked there for ten years and i had alot of good experiences. Weekly pay also. Short staffed alot but you work thru it
King Soopers,1eur2q26tu1ib800,1.0,Management sucks and does not listen to any type of concerns.
King Soopers,1euq5r83ou1ki800,1.0,This company is terrible and only about profit. Your a number to them. They don't care about you or your wellbeing. Look for a job elsewhere. Don't fall victim to this company.
King Soopers,1euni6cicu1ki800,1.0,Dont do it. Go to Safeway their much better and nicer. Kings has to much side stuff going on between upper management and corporate and so on and so on. Cover up's its no good. Don't waste your time. It'll only make you crazy.
King Soopers,1eueuenuqu1ib800,3.0,"Used to be a good place to work. Not hard to move up the ladder. Pay is ok. Department Manager not paid much more than a senior clerk. Best part of the job is getting to work with great people. Management has stupid expectations that change constantly, customers destroy your hard work in a matter of minutes when it’s busy, which is to be expected. Management gets upset when everything isn’t perfect and full at all times, which isn’t realistic. Big wigs come in and nitpick everything constantly, kind of comical with the stuff they complain about. Tough choice to leave at the time but I had enough and I couldn’t be happier now. Overall not a terrible place but there is better out there."
King Soopers,1eu6rd7oou1ki800,3.0,"They're pretty straightforward about what your job is like from the beginning. The different departments are all pretty supportive teams but there's a lot of drama between the departments and it can sometimes be started by upper management. Upper management doesn't really help much and can be verbally abusive towards their department managers and assistant store managers. Then they'll be extra nice to entry level employees, which leaves everyone feeling awkward at best. The work is tough but if you need to go easy on yourself every now and then they're pretty understanding of that. Don't expect raises. When you're hired they'll tell you you'll get raises but don't hold your breath for them. Every few months they'll put $100 on your employee card and say they appreciate you. They appreciate you enough to give you money that goes right back to the company. Overall the work environment is a positive one but that's because of the other employees so it could change depending on who's still around after X number of months."
King Soopers,1eu6je484u1ki800,1.0,"This is the job if you want to be overworked and underpaid. Upper management will change your schedule without telling you, and get mad if you don’t show up the shift they don’t tell you about it. not even close to good pay, only benefits after a year. People are constantly getting hiring then quitting or walking out with no notice. District only cares about the numbers and putting more work on you but cut your hours so they can get bonuses. Not even close to the right pay for the labor of it. walking for 8 1/2 hours and pushing a at least 300 lbs trolley full of groceries and lifting totes full of milk and cans. Customers also hate you."
King Soopers,1eu50mnlpn5b4800,4.0,Have to know what isle every individual item goes on and be able to unload a trailer and get most everything  put away before costumers start coming in to shop everyone is super friendly
King Soopers,1etcheeufu1n1800,3.0,Apply if you can the money is great and the job is not hard at all people are awesome and the days go by fast because you are so busy and you get two paid breaks and one un paid lunch
King Soopers,1esutaqk4u1n1800,1.0,"There was nothing good about working here. Upper management was unfair to all employees a lot of the time, when they themselves did nothing of importance in the store. Doesn't matter how bad you need the money, working there is prison"
King Soopers,1esmg9kduu3cn800,2.0,Hired as part time but then given full time schedule with no access to any benefits since I was officially only part time.  Then i was told another person was coming back and I would have to interview for another position.  Low low employee morale. Gave 2 weeks notice but wasn't taken seriously. Thankfully I spoke with 2 managers who remembered my giving notice.
King Soopers,1esjdb7beu31u800,1.0,"For the amount of time spent and the labor put into each shift, your efforts are barely ever recognised and I felt inferior to/ lesser than all management. The job itself was pretty simple and straightforward, but was definitely made difficult when there were only three people opening in the mornings and seemingly no cap on hourly orders.  Meaning we would have to rush to get as much done as possible without any help. Worked 12 hours straight quite a few shifts with no breaks or lunch because we had to catch up. Coworkers were nice, management definitely chose favorites."
King Soopers,1esir7hlcu3cn800,5.0,Great place to work and build a career. Flexible with schedule. Assistance with education and the ability to move up in company. I would recommend this place to anyone.
King Soopers,1esiftmjbu3cn800,3.0,"Study paycheck it is an essential job. Get to know a lot of people since you are working with the public. They need to value their employees more and do not have their favorites. , it is not fair to others."
King Soopers,1es745qo3u418800,1.0,They don’t care about the lives of their employees. They will knowingly let you contract covid and then still make you work. They will do whatever they need to do to make a dollar. This job was terrible before covid but is just straight up dangerous now.
King Soopers,1es73vd8c3ogl000,3.0,"I think that if I went for an administrative position I would’ve had a more fulfilling experience all around. Most people I met were treated fairly with few exceptions, excluding new employees in entry level positions. In the short time I worked I noticed a remarkably high turnover rate; it seems that the concepts of “seniority” and “loyalty” were terms used to articulate the clandestine hegemony the company represents. It was relatively comfortable, reasonable break times, etc; but occasionally dehumanizing and despondent. The typical “company presenting itself as a facsimile of family”."
King Soopers,1es3flktt3ogl000,1.0,The store I worked at was a high volume store so management did care how they treat staff or customers. Don't recommend king soopers at all working there or being a customer
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."
King Soopers,1erp6nqkmu1sr800,4.0,Retail is not for the weak hearted. Sometimes customers are moody.
King Soopers,1erer5cbcu49m800,2.0,"I loved all my coworkers. They were all so sweet and friendly, it was everything else that drove me away. I did a lot. I was doing three departments, and three peoples' jobs for minimum wage. I was there for over a year and my pay raises weren't enough to cover rent, let alone food and other expenses. I was stressing myself to sickness, a lot. Not to mention my mental conditions were amplified so I'd leave work in tears a lot too. I liked the busy work and fast pace environment, but it got to be too much. Especially with Covid-19 running rampant."
King Soopers,1eqqo9d5ssa99800,4.0,"I have used KS several times throughout the years for a job.  I cannot say I enjoyed working there but it was a decent job.  I worked in many different positions within the store and they all have their strengths and weaknesses.  It can be a career and some people I have known are able to live off the income, I never was.  One of my daughters dropped out of school and she got a job there and I thought it was a great decision. If you do not have the desire to continue your education, grocery management is not a bad place to work.  You get retirement, health benefits, and a decent wage if you do get into entry-level management."
King Soopers,1eqo7ft6bu49m800,4.0,The employees are probably the highlight. Management varies by stores I’ve had awesome store managers that actually care for you. Or not so great but the work isn’t super hard. The pay is good if you’re in management or been there long enough. Union job so that is a plus with job security. It’s not the worst out there.
King Soopers,1eqkl7su2u35m800,1.0,"King Soopers doesn't care. Even the good managers start not caring after they see its not going to get them any further if they care. It's ""all about the team"" when 1 or 2 people do all the work and don't get paid or the credit they deserve. I'd rather be broke than work for somewhere that doesn't even pay more than $13/hr for almost 2 years of working and being one of the hardest workers in multiple departments that I'm put in. Honestly, if you want to work somewhere stressful that doesn't pay enough and still criticizes you for doing more than your managers do, take the job. No one at my store wanted to be there everyday and would drink just to come back to work the following day"
King Soopers,1eqglhtcau35m800,5.0,It was a fun place to work at I do miss work there. I had to move away to Longmont so I could stay there. It would have made no sense to work in Fort Collins live in Longmont
King Soopers,1eq9ua935u49m800,5.0,The work is the same day in day out but the time goes quickly. The starting pay isn’t great but it goes up with time. It is a union job so raises are almost automatic
King Soopers,1eq9rl2ivu35m800,3.0,"It was an okay experience, thankful for the work family I had to make it that much better. I can not imagine how much more difficult it would be without them."
King Soopers,1eps0b6aqu35m800,1.0,Treated employees Poorly that didn't kiss up to management. Deli manager was not qualified to manage a dog kennel yet alone an entire department of a major grocer
King Soopers,1epgtopenu38g800,4.0,Its a good company if you find the right store to work for I say invest in the union other wise your job security won't be around much longer! If you put your nose to the grind and work hard you'll get far in the company
King Soopers,1ep7ij24eu32a800,3.0,"I worked at King Sooper twice and would probably work there again, However, I want a career in my life now and not just a after school job.  King Sooper has a high turn over rate because they treat their employees as ""replaceable"". NO Matter how hard you work or how good of a job you do, This leads to a lot of unfair work load on all employees, especially now during Covid-19."
King Soopers,1eovqrda2u3ib800,2.0,"I have to work until midnight most of the time. They do not explain things very well, assume you can figure it out. Not sure if I will stay there. Will see if things change. The CEO put out a news release ““Framework for Action: Diversity, Equity & Inclusion” I have not seen much in the way of ""Diversity, Equity & Inclusion""."
King Soopers,1eosmc4mgnpgr800,5.0,"The people you work with are great, at least at the store I worked with, it felt like a family and everyone was there to help, the hours are not bad at all and if you need help with planing around school and stuff it's great."
King Soopers,1eoqplpm6u44g800,3.0,"If you work there as a career, the longer your there and if you stay, it gets better. If you start out you get part time hours right away, no vacation till after 1 year, and never a set schedule."
King Soopers,1eon76vnqu44g800,4.0,Good work environment overall. It's great for developing customer services skills. Also great for busy and hands-on work. Not ideal for career growth unless you're interested in store management .
King Soopers,1eo7h2n9t3h84000,5.0,"I enjoyed the work as a cashier. This was a large store and the work could get overwhelming for me. Very busy every day. Loved the staff, the management treated me really good! I moved, so I had to leave the position."
King Soopers,1ensmigmmu2d6800,1.0,"Overworked and underpaid, management doesn't care about covid, was told to lie about symptoms so i could come to work (i stayed home) . Made me dislike the company and i cant wait to never go back"
King Soopers,1enoqgbqou2d6800,2.0,I loved my coworkers but the company is all about seniority which sucked because the less seniority you have the less options you have. I always got the sucky schedule hours were being cut left to right. Lunch was not long enough
King Soopers,1enfvpsv1u1tu800,3.0,"After 10 years with the company,  I am being told I have to work Saturdays AND Sundays.  No care given to work life balance. Management overstepped. Favoritism is huge in stores.  Fair treatment doesn't exist."
King Soopers,1enej9hbuu2eo800,1.0,"I was a head clerk. And yes I made good money, however I was there all day and night. Huge high turn over rate. Worst position to be in. The upper managers were awful, they threw you under the bus just to save their butt No support."
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."
King Soopers,1en7ab0j2u3d8800,1.0,You can’t ask for a certain schedule or days off. You must give them 100% open availability. They never have enough people because no one wants to work there after learning that.
King Soopers,1en1tf7lpu3d8800,3.0,"The employees are truly the heart of the company. I worked for King Soopers for 10 years and made so many good friends. So many of them were so loyal and hard working and I just don't feel as though the company really recognizes people for their work ethic and determination. I started as a Courtesy Clerk like so many and worked my way into management. I was a Head Clerk and an Assistant Bakery Manager and truthfully the pay wasn't worth the amount of responsibility to me after topping out as a cashier. The pay overall isn't bad, especially if they pay based on experience but they could definitely pay management better. Management could treat people better too. Upper Management was always more of an issue. The best part was helping customers and making those personal connections and working with such a fun loving group of people. If you enjoy working a flexible schedule, working with the public and like a fast paced work environment then this might be a good fit!"
King Soopers,1emuqvluau3d8800,2.0,"I loved my job except when they had me doing janitorial work when I was not hired for that.  And I swore on the sales floor, but there were absolutely no customers around, and I heard several times other employees swearing.  I did love when I was bagging groceries and helping disabled customers do their shopping. I didn't mind collecting carts outside or putting items back in there right places"
King Soopers,1emkp8i1nu1ac800,4.0,I like that it is always busy in long soopers when I am working there and that I typically have work to do. I Ike being able to pick my availablilty and when I can work.
King Soopers,1em8mag5ou2u5800,1.0,Culture may as well not exist. The company values are just words. Most people run out the door as soon as they can while a handful take advantage of the company with overtime. Toxic environment.
King Soopers,1em2i7g7po16r800,1.0,"The Kroger company has all the right words for how much they care about their employees, but zero follow through when it comes to actually caring."
King Soopers,1eloqm5hdu2j4800,1.0,"The Store Manager will constantly pick on you if you are a department leader. She has no sense of compassion or empathy. I have had to cancel many appointments to stay overtime only for her to degrade me the next day. I have never had a boss like her in my many years of grocery experience, nor would I recommend anybody to work for her. I love my job, but hate where I work. She will pick her favorites and if you aren’t one of those, she will surely let you know through her poor communication skills. You don’t get talked to, you get yelled at. I have never had a compliment from her since I’ve worked at this location. She doesn’t do anything to actually help and motivate departments. And I’ve heard even worse things from CUSTOMERS about her. I could go on and on."
King Soopers,1elbnobd0u2j4800,1.0,"Managers are rude, will bully you openly and directly. HR doesn't care about you or how you're treated, they only hire part time but make you work 40+ hours a week so you're not considered fulltime and don't get the benefits."
King Soopers,1elbhhv4mu2j4800,3.0,"Nearly everything is seniority-based, including advancement, department transfers, and scheduling. This is probably a good place to work if you plan to work there for many years, but if you are just there for a little while you won't see the full benefits. The employee discount is nice, though, and they feed the staff quite frequently."
King Soopers,1el102dhju1qi800,1.0,"Favoritism, unethical,  abusive non positive environment, horrible pay, fires good employees and keeps a lot of bad ones and its all about who you know and are friends with. No promotions unless you are gay or have an ethnic  background. Horrible place to work for anymore. It used to be an amazing company."
King Soopers,1ekhsa9b8u1t7800,2.0,"When I first applied for this position, the description made a CC sound like a job behind the service desk, greeting customers and helping them check out but it is in fact is nothing like that. The courtesy clerk position is basically a glorified janitorial job just with more personal interactions. Any unwanted task that the front end does not want to do is thrown at you. Training is abysmal. They put you in front of a computer for 4 hours to watch safety videos and expect you to understand everything they want from you even when you've had no actual training on what to do during downtime between bagging orders."
King Soopers,1ekf3fo5ku3t2800,1.0,"I worked at multiple locations for almost two years now. Never a huge deal, good days and bad, but pretty laid back work. You don't have high expectations as a Cashier so that's good. Everything was fine until I was retroactively punisher for a policy I broke that occurred over a month earlier from termination date. Two weeks before my termination I signed off on an updated notice of policy change and immediately stopped what I was doing. I realized this was a violation and ceased that behavior without compliant. Work went on like usual for two weeks and then I was called into a meeting with Management and was suspended for a week, then at the follow up meeting was terminated without debate. Toxic, corporate bootlickers care more about retroactive punishment that cost the company zero dollars in losses and zero customer complaints than their employees. I immediately ceased the protocol breaking behavior, a simple coupon policy violation, and was fired with no debate. I had a clean record, not even a single write up, only two callouts in my whole two years due to sickness. Nope, doesn't matter, immediate discharge with no appeal. You are nothing but a number to management/corporate, they don't care one bit about you."
King Soopers,1ekenpags3oh3000,3.0,"Depends entirely on location, department and position. My experience revolves around favoritism and “never good enough”. The pay and benefits are great, definitely. I’ve met many amazing people through this company. However, managers and supervisors have become bottom of the barrel, since 200+ salary positions were eliminated, there is no incentive to move up. The entire company is inconsistent and overall communication lacks, from sales floor to office to warehouse, no one is ever on the same page. Even with the lack of communication, cooperate is happy and quick to do “surprise” walks to criticize and suggest disciplinary action if you do poorly.. I understand full well every workplace has downsides and unfavorable bosses, but as a dedicated hard working employee and manager, this company ran me into the ground physically and mentally. If you just want to work, definitely! If you have any brain or voice of your own, or want to advance past a department manager, this is not the place for you."

King Soopers,1ek9eaoltu3t5800,4.0,I worked for them several times so they must have offered something.  I just never enjoyed it.  If you are someone that doesn't plan on going to college I cant think of a better place to advance.
King Soopers,1ek7dpuimu3t5800,2.0,"As a pharmacy intern, I loved my pharmacy crew, my techs and pharmacists, but we were worked hard and not given enough hours. If you have good techs, you appreciate them so much. But due to techs are part of a union, you have the bad techs which takes forever for them to get written up and fired. We had a tech who was the worst, called in, did absolutely nothing. She was on her final notice and she did a no call no show, couldn't fire hire because it was ""a long time"" (4 months) since her last offense so her slate was wiped clean. My manager would have loved to hire someone more helpful."
King Soopers,1ek0cqchlu3cj800,1.0,Honest hard work gets you nowhere at King Soopers. At least not at the King Soopers on the corner of Pace and 17th. I worked my butt off for nearly five years and they never gave me a substantial raise. If you speak your opinion they treat you like s***.
King Soopers,1ejvqfnq53o71000,2.0,I accepted a part time position and they switched it to full time.  I accepted a position for customer service and they switched it to fuel center.  I often went 5 hours without a break due to their staffing problems.  Sometimes lunch was catered but by the time I was able to take lunch there was nothing left.

King Soopers,1ejtafbieu1l6800,3.0,"I like my immediate supervisor. He's very positive and seems interested in the employees in his department. He tries to motivate us to improve. Store manager and assistant store managers seem nice enough but don't notice if you do anything above and beyond, which I very often do. (I literally have done everything they've asked me to do-- come in early, stay late, come in on my day off, go work at another store, etc.) And I often clean up other people's messes as I go, or organize the shelves while I'm doing my regular job. But after a year of taking pride in the store and not being noticed at all, it's kind of hard to stay motivated."
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."
King Soopers,1ejnte0aou1l6800,5.0,Working with king Soopers gave me the opportunity to really feel part of the team. Everyone seems to recognize that we accomplish goals better when we work together and acknowledge each person's contribution to the team.
King Soopers,1ejgvqoqgnpdo800,1.0,"Do not work at the candelas location. There is no advancement, you will be stuck here forever if you do work here. and the managers are the worst part of the job. Do not subject yourself to this for a measly 11 dollars an hour. Have some respect in yourself."
King Soopers,1ejgsspilo1i3800,3.0,"I liked the people I worked with, I got along with basically everyone. The pay was good too, reasonable for being a clerk and great for being a lead. But management doesn't know how to react to any adversity. Management doesn't tolerate recommendations or hearing about any problems that individuals have regarding job functions, policies or with the department. Instead of resolving issues, they will retaliate against anyone who expresses concerns or has a problem with how things are done. Leadership at the higher level and lower level needs attention."
King Soopers,1ejg63ml8u1qd800,3.0,"Customers can often be really terrible especially at the fried chicken desk, but the department managers were always on top of it. Why do I have to write a review of a job I had years ago in order to see other reviews?"
King Soopers,1ej1nbtu6sqbl800,2.0,Good first second job other then that just no i mean it could be different at other locations too but just its been a really toxic one at the green vally ranch location be careful!
King Soopers,1ej1fgl8vu1dj800,3.0,"Pay is really good. Great job security. Lots of advancement opportunities. However, there is no personal/work life balance. Expectations of employees is unrealistic. Stressful and negative environment."
King Soopers,1ei9l8gabsqbl800,1.0,No work life balance assistance store managers and store managers will let you literally work more then them to so called get the job done as they like to say but never actually help.
King Soopers,1ei47c74brct2800,2.0,I didn't like working for this company. You are just a number here. Breaks were always late. They managment treated employees poorly and they were disorganized with their schedules. Employees called out a lot.
King Soopers,1ei1ok8npro7r800,2.0,Kings has very poor management. They can’t work well with school schedules or anything. I had a mandatory school event and I gave management over 2 weeks notice and they wouldn’t give me the time off.
King Soopers,1eht27k1cro7r800,4.0,This job isn't for everyone there are certain processes in place that must be followed as with any job the jobs does have its own rewards. Training is both on the job and computer as well.
King Soopers,1ehpuamtjr53c800,3.0,I really enjoyed working here but a lot of people liked to talk and not work which can get really frustrating when they get paid more than you. The benefits like discounts and healthcare were good I just honestly didn’t really feel appreciated as an employee and the work I did.
King Soopers,1ehdd3a19r4qu800,4.0,Didn’t get much training but all my coworkers are very supportive.  It’s been difficult as an employee to be allowed an alternative face covering for personal health reasons.  That has been the only down side.

King Soopers,1ehb3un41rapg800,1.0,"I definitely would not recommend EVER working there unless of course you want to relive Grade School Drama every single day! People were always trying to throw each other under the bus! They would backstab and gossip about other Coworkers, alot of kissing up to upper management! Everyone hated thier jobs but they were to cowardly to tell Upper management how they really felt! Alot of employee fakeness going on because the real and intelligent ones never stuck around to long. I hated it, every single day was like the worst day of my life!"
King Soopers,1eh85706qss99800,3.0,The management at king soopers is falling apart. The managers don't do their jobs very well. They kept forgetting about other employees breaks which caused breaks to be at least 45 minutes late. The management would always take their breaks on time.
King Soopers,1eh2udfi0qh1c800,4.0,The company has been amazing during the pandemic with expressing appreciation and rewarding employees but sometimes your management will not back you up. They want you to follow specific rules and if you don’t you can get written up but when the customer complains about the rules you have to enforce management will Make you look bad and do whatever the customer wants. But that is somewhat normal when working in customer service.
King Soopers,1eh2sl1uaqh1c800,1.0,Kings Soopers at least at this store is not a good place store to work for. The managers like to tell everyone else what to do. They like to play favoritism to some people and they can get away with anything while others are always being judged and watched and can’t do anything right. I would not recommend working here.
King Soopers,1eh162kbbqh1c800,2.0,"Very low staff, not enough pay for the amount of work that is done, not enough hours, did not work with my schedule, short staff every single day when the store is busy"
King Soopers,1egppl8igqh1c800,1.0,Bringing in carts and bagging peoples groceries is how I started out and then eventually made it up to being a cashier. management did not really work with me on my second job I had to take. Hardest part of this job was keeping up with every one.

King Soopers,1egbiujcrs4v4800,3.0,Pay does not equal the expected duties!!! More for less and compile the daily duties with as much work as possible. Keep the pace and deal with unreasonable customers.
King Soopers,1efs9qa243chj000,2.0,"This was my first job, so take it with a grain of salt. I applied for an E-commerce position and was hired as such after an in person interview. It wasn't until I was half way through paperwork when they realized I was a minor. Instead of having it stated in the application that you must be 18+ to be an E-Commerce clerk, they let anyone apply. So, they just threw me into a Courtesy Clerk position (one I was not interested in and specifically didn't apply for). I was paid $.25 less than promised and my first week of training was completely messed up because they still had me enrolled in the E-Commerce training programs. I was introduced to only the main head manager who I never saw again. HR left me completely lost with no contacts or help with who I was actually working with at the front-end. I didn't meet my actual main supervisor until two weeks into the job. Personally, the CC position is just too physically draining. Carts are awful and I came to despise people as I watched them leave carts around the parking lot and there utter disrespect for others. The amount of times I had cars almost hit me while doing carts is too high. Drivers rarely stopped at the stop sign at the cross-walk. I felt no respect from the people in the store. Although many of my coworkers were kind, I still felt very out of place and unwelcome. I personally would not recommend a CC position. Every unwanted task is thrown at you. Management is a bit of a mess and there's a major lack in communication. Came home everyday feeling upset and exhausted. I know jobs aren't meant to be fun, but this one just"
King Soopers,1efofuth5r572800,3.0,"Upper management does not stand behind their assistants when it comes to store policies or sticking up for deli clerks when it comes to an issue with product. There have been multiple times when a customer has been upset because we run out of chicken and have to cook more. I've had threats from customers over this. ""The customer is always right"" Even when explaining the situation to the manager you can't explain it on the sales floor because ""other customers might be around and our reputation is on the line."" Someone calls out sick they don't call anyone else in to cover. You are expected to do you job and theirs.. Training consisted of two hours online video. Not much for hands on. The department is very disorganized. Employees don't get their breaks on time hardly ever. There are moments where the department gets so busy that there's 12 orders and only one person taking the order and slicing the products. The only time when the deli gets extra help is when there's a cooperate walk."
King Soopers,1efnoejetbfgm800,2.0,Very harsh and  hostile work eniviorrment. Upper managers need to give more praise and more help when depts are low on help. Not a great place to work. Lots of chit chat about other employees and there lives.
King Soopers,1efnfuu2g3chj000,5.0,I have been employed by them for about 6 months now and I really enjoy working with with people who genuinely care about you. The advancement opportunities are amazing and fast. Great training modules and manager to walk you through each phase.
King Soopers,1efl6ldvrr572800,3.0,"It is a typical retail working environment with good days and bad. Typically is fast-paced, customer service oriented, and high demand. Corporate has a level of disconnect to store-level operations and has unrealistic result expectations."
King Soopers,1efi3j0te3gjj000,5.0,Awesome place to work very hard to not like anybody or wanna quit i loved it there would go back if i can get in there again one of the best jobs I've had
King Soopers,1efcso4svp1h1800,2.0,I love my fellow employees. They are helpful and welcoming. The downside is management tries to work you until you drop for the least amount of pay possible. I have worked there for 2 years am known as one of the fastest and relyable workers. I have even covered managment for a few hours but in 2 years I've only gotten $0.10 raise.
King Soopers,1ef6qdolvrcmp800,4.0,"Overall the pay is good and staff is friendly. However, the management team could use some work on getting to know their team and not pick and choose who they will talk to and promote. The work culture would have been better if the store management team was more involved."
King Soopers,1ef594ufdp1h1800,2.0,"Working here is depressing. I worked here for 10 years and watched it go downhill fast once Kroger bought them out. There is no schedule that accommodates a family. Even after 10 years and especially in a lead/management position. They have 0 care for you as a human, as you can see by the massive layoffs they are continuously doing, even to faithful employees of 20+ years. Pay is garbage as well."
King Soopers,1ef57gmv3p1h1800,1.0,Wasn't impressed with them and I worked there for 11 1/2 years no promotion no thanks for work done above my pay grade training people working 2 weeks straight vacations pushed back coming in on days off people don't stay
King Soopers,1eek52momp1ci800,1.0,"Simply put I couldn't recommend this place less. Just being there is draining. Additionally, the managers are okay at best and permanently on a power trip at worst. They manage all of your breaks for you but can't seem to do simple divsion to evenly divide a shift. Next, I have to talk about the training, to be consise, its a waste of time. Currently it is mostly outdated and doesn't even cover half the tasks we are meant to do.. Personally, I didn't even know what my job was until I was out on the floor doing it. My next gripe about the job is the scheduling system. Its legit the worst and should be reason enough for NOBODY to work there part time. First off your hourly availability will be ignored, so don't expect to stay long if you don't have 100% availability. Addtionally despite having a online system in place it is not used in favor of a locker where you can request schedule changes via a note. Lastly, in about a month before school start expect a huge cut in hours since they overhired. My advise is simply to WORK SOMEWHERE ELSE!"
King Soopers,1eegmuooiq359800,1.0,"No schedule flexibility. You will be told you’ll be working part time then scheduled for full time. If you have doctors appointments, that’s your problem. Toxic environment, backstabbing and gossip welcome."
King Soopers,1eeet9cmqr4b0800,3.0,"I didn't work for a long time, but It was my first job and I did get a good amount of expeirence but it really didnt feel worth it at times. I struggle with a lot of anxiety and I put that aside for this job and I strived for good customer service and made sure every person I met at the store I was kind, helpful, and not too pushy when it came to small talk. I continued to not be recognized when I put so much work into making sure customers were happy. Felt disapointing and degrading being judged on how I did my job and told I didn't do well. Also, be prepared to continue to have to go and get carts when its pouring rain. The cashiers are all pretty kind and nice to you, being in high school i often didnt feel talked down to which was a plus.Be aware some managers were kind.. others not as much. I was very excited to have this job but every time I left I felt drained and defeated. It did have a nice rec room for breaks and lunch. If you're a extrovert who is active, you will thrive on this job, otherwise i would just consider your options."
King Soopers,1eebldcucp1eq800,2.0,"Interview was less than pleasant, Manager interviewed me and nothing that he presented during the interview was pertinent to the job I was interviewing for. All the managers, human resourses and supervisors were lacking hygiene, professionalism and decorum."

King Soopers,1edvc9hums37k800,2.0,"Could’ve been better! Lack of communication with management, as well as lack of communication regarding scheduling. Overall a decent place to work if you suffer a severe lack of standards and are immune to job related time warps"
King Soopers,1eds7ce2nsemq800,3.0,"They really expect you to dedicate all of your time for the company and have a lot of people work more than they are supposed to. F.E. A guy we have here has a trigger to seizures when exposed to a lot of heat, has him outside pushing carts till he drops, and had it happen twice. Had me picking up dead rats when they are supposed to have it done professionally. They also don’t communicate when your days change or rescheduled, they expect you to know without being told. Terrible management at my store specifically. Really didn’t like this job, the labor/work wasn’t the problem. They still don’t pay me enough for how much they have me do anyways. They have me do almost 3 different departments jobs as a maitinence worker."
King Soopers,1edn874lho8do800,3.0,It’s one of those jobs where you don’t really feel much fulfillment in my case. I just go and work there and nothing else. Don’t really feel any better or any less.

King Soopers,1edabn79mp2ng800,2.0,"This company does pay me better than I have ever received at any other retail store.  I started off 50 cents higher than when I worked at my previous employer, and in a year gained almost $3 more an hour.  The management here does not care about your personal life when writing a schedule.  For example I asked to have Sundays off for family and religious purposes and they said the can't give me the time off even though I'm very religious.  The management has favorites and will single out those who are less fortunate.  My store doesnt care if night crew doesnt wear their apron but managers in other departments will tell me I MUST have my apron on or get a write up.  If you have a disability they still expect you to work to the same speed as those who do not have a disability of any kind.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!"
King Soopers,1ed89k1jvp13q800,4.0,A typical day at work consisted of checking out customers with their groceries in a 8 hour shift. I learned to always keep busy. It makes time go by faster plus I like being productive. Management was always there to have your back if a problem arose. Every one is a team player at work. We were responsible for making sure the shelves were stocked with products for our shoppers. The hardest part of the job was learning how to deescalate unhappy customers. The best part was having everything in stock to keep our customers coming back.

I had to quit my job here due to not having sundays off and working more hours then I should while I was a high school student.

King Soopers,1e8vgjdqihe6a800,4.0,I often had store managers overstep and didn't really know the process of the requirements for the job in the pick up area. The environment was great and not too stressful. Often peaceful when the job was done correctly. Customers almost always ended up leaving satisfied
King Soopers,1e8nsg0vgotq7800,4.0,"I had the most amazing boss I've ever had at the beginning of my career at kings. You can make your way up quick in the company, however there is no help to obtain goals. Always was promised training,  which I never got,  an no matter how hard I worked I was always put down an lead me into a deep depression. I eventually quit because of sleep deprivation, and was at the lowest point in my entire life."
King Soopers,1e8mmj7cool7i800,1.0,"I went to this company because I heard it was a good company to work with. Little did I know, 18 months later it is full of empty promises, bad ethics and morals, horrible management, terrible benefits, and the list goes on. In addition, you have to work for an entire year before you get to use any vacation and forget about being able to use your sick time. You have to be gone for three or more days with a doctors note in order to use any of it. If you miss two days and have a doctors note, you just don't get paid for those days but yet they say ""you get a week of sick time to use"". I was in management and could keep going but I will stop now, just stay away from this company."
King Soopers,1e89vtk3qod61800,4.0,I like some of the people there I haven't worked there since April 2019 after I had my son but even now that I go in there they know me even the people I never really talked to and I'm comfortable there there is a lot of people who are knew that were hired on after I left and they are very friendly as well.

King Soopers,1e6kgki67o1bh800,4.0,Must be able to provide great customer service while overseeing workload and daily general store operations all while maintaining proper safe work habits and safe food handling procedures. Must be able to multi task in order to keep pace with the fast and diligent work enviroment.
King Soopers,1e6i0eqcuhcsh800,4.0,It was an enjoyable work experience because the managers made my life really easy when training me. All the employees there also had a happy smile and were excited to work.
King Soopers,1e6g2htp0on3s800,4.0,"While there were definitely some ups and downs I loved my coworkers and loved the fast paced environment. I definitely had an experience there that will be hard to replace. Hopefully after everything with Covid-19 blows over, they’ll welcome be back with open arms since that’s the only reason I had to resign"
King Soopers,1e6818o2ahcrp800,2.0,I enjoyed the job requirements and the job itself but did not like or get along with management. They also always never gave me days off I requested in advance.
King Soopers,1e66uf3n6hbqo800,1.0,"I was hired ""off the street"" as they put it. I was a head clerk and then also a GM manager.  I was treated terribly.  Their culture is really disgusting. I also worked over 60 hrs a week. Beware. Upper management treat everyone terribly. They figure if you decided to work in the grocery business you must have some issue. They micromanage to the extreme. Even though there's training to fo your job."
King Soopers,1e605fi2qhd76800,1.0,"There is favoritisms in this company  the manager dos not care if you have experience degrees or background, you chat with them after work they get you at a higher level. Very rude upper management."
King Soopers,1e5vbiq0qhdag800,3.0,"The hiring process started off pretty rough. It took them over a month to get me started and the manager lied about trying several times to contact me. He had me drive back and forth just to fill out a couple paperwork. Once I did get started, training was not clear at all. There was no description in the online courses I needed to take, and I had people who only worked there for a few days train me. Clicklist is a pretty easy job, but the environment you work in contributes to a long day at work. It is hardly organized, but I guess it's something they expect employees to get used to. Scheduling is a mess. You have access to look it up online but it was wrong, and they ended up having to contact everyone each day they messed up on times. Planning ahead on your days is almost impossible with the only exception that you know that you'll be working that day but not knowing what time. The Clicklist department area is way too small for the amount of orders they have to fulfill (if you have claustrophobia you may need to take a lot of breaks) and it can be hard to shop while helping customers because you are timed. It would be great to see some changes to this department due to the fact it is becoming so popular."
King Soopers,1e5m6oe50hc7g803,1.0,"This company just cares about their wants/needs, family means nothing to them, taking vacations, or sick days they will ridicule you for and treat employees like they mean nothing, but think they are doing great and allow store management to harass, threaten and talk down to employees than hide it under paperwork."
King Soopers,1e5jrbvjkhd4h802,3.0,"Most things working for the company are good. The downsides are a schedule that you never know ahead of time. You can never really plan much of anything because your schedule is posted a day before you may or may not have to work. The compensation itself is pretty low. Both of these downsides change once you have tenure, but that will take many years to obtain."
King Soopers,1e5j7lq6lhd2v801,3.0,"Days were usually busy with fried chicken orders or deli slicing, morning prep was simple, clean up took quite some time at night. assisting customers is a simple task usually, very rarely had rude customers."

King Soopers,1e2o12cjrq5bf803,4.0,The job was the same thing every night. Listing heavy items and separation of items to certain places. Management was confusing at times. The higher ups were great but the department managers thought they knew everything.

King Soopers,1e1v5ccqtolq3802,1.0,The managers don't care about your well being. They will have you doing any job and not compensate you fairly. The staff and overall environment there is negative and draining
King Soopers,1e1shn9ouhctm803,2.0,"Will never go back to retail, worst hours,pay, and mangers take credit for everything the clerks do. Wouldn't recommend, decent for a 1st job. Definitely not a career for me."

King Soopers,1e1l4iab2ouer802,2.0,Managers couldn’t care less but the people make the job. Easy enough positions but training isn’t a priority which leads to frustration especially around new hires.
King Soopers,1e1iglocqhd6k807,2.0,"The job is easy, bagging groceries and checking people out. My only issue is that management tends to favor certain people over other in the front end."
King Soopers,1e1i02jaaouer801,5.0,Being at King Soopers with a good job I didn't mind it good people to work with and it was a nice calm job and if I need hours sometimes it gives me sometimes it wouldn't start work harder

King Soopers,1e0oua1iuhc9v802,3.0,"I had an overall good experience with King Soopers. I got along well with most of the other employees, and all of my direct supervisors. The worst part was the schedule, because it was all over the place. You never new for sure when you were going to work until the Saturday before---which makes Sundays tricky. I worked weekdays during the day for months, and then I had two weeks of night shifts, before being put back on day shifts. My eating and sleeping habits were all out of wack. Besides that, and sometimes having to do maintenance shifts, it was a pretty good place to work. They are willing to hire people with very little credentials, and they don't skimp on hours. The discount is decent, and the pay isn't bad. I like talking to people, so I had a nice time. And if you schedule for specific days off you want in advance, the schedule isn't as bad."

But, I’m all reality, I worked my hardest there then other co work see and they let me go. But, now that I am graduated I feel more prepared to work. I did learn lessons there though."
King Soopers,1dv2earqphcta802,3.0,Fast paced with a focus on accountability.  Not a whole lot of clear communication. Results driven.  The hardest part is finding a balance between work and free time. Need to be available when the situation calls for it.

King Soopers,1dunb4c54hdbl801,1.0,Top heavy management they ruled by fear they don't respect their employees. A micro manager to death do not allow you to do your job. They treat their people unfairly and all they try to do is cut ours and cut out jobs.

King Soopers,1drqdro81h44g803,2.0,"Absolutely horrible. I have never worked for a company that tries to squeeze as much from their employees as this place has on top of this they lie to every employee to cover up union contracts and company policies so they can force employees to work 12+ hour shifts with the threat of being fired if you don't stay past your scheduled hours. Management was absolutely weak, everything works by seniority so being new you'll never have the chance to initiate strong ideas and qualities for the job. This seniority also provides a inequality to the work place, basically managers will be managers just because they have seniority not because they are good at the job which makes for a slow disruptive work environment. Getting hired took 8+ in person meetings because they had lost my paperwork several times. Nothing is organized and everything is 100% chaotic all the time. I have never worked for a company run so horridly and I have to advise anyone to stay away because it's not worth the headache."

King Soopers,1drjsua8924go003,4.0,"Typical work day at King Soopers, you hit the ground running, stocking shelves unloading trucks, interactions with the customers, sometimes we have to go and pick up product from another store, and sometimes had to make deliveries."
King Soopers,1drjsqf1r24eo003,4.0,"Fast paced enviornment Guaranteed full time hours. Diverse. Lack of Upper Management support. The hardest part of the job is lack of understanding and support or care from Management, especially during difficult enviornments. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a hard working employees. Willingness to help each other during periods of tough work hours or lack of crew."
King Soopers,1drj94cqmou7g803,3.0,The company has changed for the worst all they care about is getting people in and out fast. It's changed so much feeling like I'm a robot must go faster to get you out.

King Soopers,1dreko1br24eo003,1.0,"Seniority is the only important factor.  Staying there longer will get you more benefit, regardless of your work ethic.  I worked extremely hard with no reward for several months.  They also misled me about benefits.  I work 40+ hours a week, but am considered part time... So no benefits.  Seems illegal, but what can I even do?"
King Soopers,1dre2jtu0ou7g802,4.0,My experience working with King Soopers was that the upper management was biased and played favorites. I had a few employees start rumors about me and cause drama during the workday. I repeatedly went to upper management numerous times to deal with my concerns however they did not address the issues which made my work environment hostile and uncomfortable.
King Soopers,1drc6b9nr24f7003,5.0,Miss working at king Soopers. Rewarding experience. Love the interaction with all the customers. If you are a hard worker and love helping people you'll have a great career with one of the best companies I've been employed with.
King Soopers,1dr5j8l2j24e2001,3.0,"I’ve worked at King Soopers for almost 2 years. In the beginning work went smooth and there was clear order and direction. Nowadays, the company is unorganized and demanding. One worker may be under a different title then forced to do someone else’s job due to lazy management; not by all but by some."
King Soopers,1dr4q4cfq24e2003,4.0,I was a cashier for two and a half years with King Soopers. Customers always come first and employees are treated extremely unfairly. Seniority is way more important than it should be. Typically in the front end there is an incredible amount of drama. Not for people without patience.
King Soopers,1dr4g2qdh24g2005,5.0,overall positive experience. People will help you be successful. company gives back to the community and their employees. Many opportunities for growth.
King Soopers,1dquqqqcbh3io802,3.0,great people but the hours were rough and unforgiving especially with a school schedule and were not lenient and my days off. But overall would suggest working there

King Soopers,1dqcc96up52u6802,3.0,I enjoyed working with my co-workers. This was a union store. Had trouble getting paid and the union did nothing. Your raises had nothing to do with your work ethic.
King Soopers,1dqae610ph3mq803,1.0,They don't care for their employees or train them.
King Soopers,1dq67m7ckh3mq801,3.0,Might have just been my location but there were many problems with staff. When I tried applying at another location the staff there heard many things about the other store and the rude staff
King Soopers,1dpqcne5qh426802,1.0,Used to be a Great company to work for. But after 23 yrs it has went Down Hill. Sad to Say but true. The way they treat their Employees isn't the Best. When they do get a good Employee they dont stay because of bad Management. And unfair practices.
King Soopers,1dpp3c1gnh3q5802,3.0,I’ve worked there 25 years and I constantly see management cutting staff in the pharmacy each year. New employees are hired at min wage and get trained then find a new job that pays a higher wage. Frustrating! Pharmacy technicians get paid the same wage as a cashier.. just isn’t right.
King Soopers,1dpoml54mh3u4800,2.0,"It's retail. Shiny on the outside, difficult and disillusioning on the inside. If you are top management you can at least afford your bills (which means salaried with no life/work balance). If you're anything below including department heads, still no work/life balance and you will be under appreciated and underpaid.  However, I have managed to make it work."
King Soopers,1dpl9q4f0h3q5801,4.0,"The company is constantly changing, it has allot of growing pains. The management cultural changes because each one has there style of running the business.  Overall pay is good hours vary good and bad coworkers."
King Soopers,1dphhrntnh423802,2.0,The company doesn't seem to care about their employees... very poor & inexperienced managers because they just choose who they like whether they know or do their job... good employees get the short end of the stick while those who dont do their job just kiss but & are fine... they dont train you well at all
King Soopers,1dpgl8lfgh3q2804,2.0,I thought this job would be at least okay after working 27 years at another grocery store but it's really bad! They tell you 2 weeks training and I get 3 days and thrown into a one man department with expectations of finishing huge loads in 8 hours or you stay until it's done. Could be an extra hour or 5 or more. Unless you have no life don't work here.
King Soopers,1dpe95ncsh45o803,2.0,The typical role of a courtesy clerk is a frustrating one. The store is often understaffed resulting in endless rushes and late breaks. The good coworkers are the only upside but the high turnover rate means that they'll likely be leaving soon.
King Soopers,1dpe821d0h3pn801,2.0,I have been with this company for almost 2 years. I have been bullied with reporting to managers and they have done absolutely nothing. I and a few other coworkers always feared about getting in trouble for the smallest things by our Starbucks lead
King Soopers,1dpdhnbj0b838802,5.0,"King Soopers is a great place to work management cares about your progress and offers a lot of training , it’s a fun environment, very busy and fast paced but lots of help"
King Soopers,1dp8aetp6h3m3802,5.0,"It was a good working environment,  the staff was great and very nice. If you are looking for a good place to work this would be great place to start at."
King Soopers,1dp1iuqiqh3pn806,1.0,I can't believe how poorly run this store is currently.  The manager and 2 assistant managers were gone overnight.  The new people came in;  no introductions.  They ignore the cashiers and any customers in the front end area.  The front end manager and store manager are old buddies.
King Soopers,1dp0lb4eah3tn801,5.0,There's a routine for every shift.  Leaning how to complete the requirements for each shift as expected by management is critical.  It builds your confidence.
King Soopers,1dourgrlhh3lt803,2.0,"I worked in the deli and cheese island at their Lafayette location for nearly three years, I actually really enjoyed the job despite the flawed political system inside. However, I had to quit because a girl had been harassing me in the store and on Facebook (confronting me in a hostile manner on the sales floor, calling me cheese hoe, wrongfully reporting me to managers for things I never did; just a sad 30 year old obsessed with my boyfriend) for over a year and HR and corporate would do nothing to help, not even transfer her. The pay and hours are livable if you stick around and gain seniority but I don't recommend simply for the fact that they tolerate harassment among coworkers."
King Soopers,1dou7h69mh3hi802,3.0,The work is decent and the management isn't too overbearing and help you to understand the job better. Overall the job is great for those who stick around long term.
King Soopers,1doo7ql7eh3th802,5.0,"Overall loved getting paid every week. The salary could have been a little bit higher. Liked the fast pace environment,, made the time go by quick. Friendly community"
King Soopers,1dol2vlerh41i802,5.0,Good management and work life balance. Managers recognize your effort and work load. They promote collaborative work environment. A lot of opportunities for growth.
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."
King Soopers,1dojipmfhh41i801,3.0,"If your ok working a retail schedule i.e random hours that vary per week, holidays and weekends then this is a good job. Not very physically demanding job. Decent benefits."
King Soopers,1dohcpbvhh45i802,3.0,"I got to learn the service desk. I did returns, lotto, bill pay, and western union. Enjoyed helping the customers. I ended up leaving this job because of poor management and further my career do in home elderly care."
King Soopers,1dof64juuh41a804,2.0,"Job security is top notch because of the Union benefits, unless the management cares enough to have it out for you or you're caught stealing from the company, you'll almost never lose your position. It takes a great amount of time, patience, and focus to truly fire an employee from this company, and most managers (at least in my experience) don't have the time or patience to do so because of how much work they have themselves. As long as your doing the basic necessities required of your position, you should be fine. Workload varies depending on department and location, be weary of working at busier stores if you have a hard time focusing or keeping a fast pace through the work day. Liked working here because of cool staff, employees, and coworkers, but overall the company itself is a joke. They keep trying to fix something that wasn't broken and are becoming more and more strict on how things are done because of either financial issues the company may be experiencing in the market or to try and keep up with how much they are required to pay their employees (at least their department heads) to be able to live with the increasing economy and housing market in Colorado, which has caused a lot of good and loyal management workers to leave the company because of their being more and more pressure added, which in turn benefits the company financially because they then get to promote someone new and hire someone else to work for less money. As far as management goes, work/life balance is rare, to be expected in grocery retail, but good luck trying to schedule a doctor's appointment"
King Soopers,1dof4q3u7h3ha802,3.0,The management was the greatest part of the job.  They are people that became my friends. They also stayed very professional in a work place. They were very good people.
King Soopers,1doeockefh3p9806,1.0,You do not want to work here.  They treat their employees like slaves and do not value people.  They will cut your hours and treat you poorly just to make more money.
King Soopers,1docs32i5h3ha802,4.0,"Understaffing is becoming rampant in many locations. The people make or break your work environment. Good benefits overall, but there is a year long wait to aquire them."
King Soopers,1docf3skqh41a802,5.0,"Clean, enormous, busy, comfortable, hours available, organized, cool enviroment, many employees, long days, short-breaks, updatdd systems, starbucks, just needs more space for customer ideas."
King Soopers,1do8b3lc7h3p6802,2.0,Overall an ok place too work. Has improved since I have started and see positive changes coming.  Pay is fair and the work is fast paced.  Ok saving perks.
King Soopers,1do4cdrvd0mt6000,3.0,"Under paid and over worked hardly ever are able to get 40 hours, when you start there everyone has seniority over you because they have been there years and years and fall under a grandfather clause and are protected by the union, which I understand is good for them but not new employees"
King Soopers,1dnv8otckh3li802,1.0,"King Soopers was a very fast paced very demanding job, that requires you to work night weekends and holidays with different days off every week if you get two at all"
King Soopers,1dnsi1bcqh3le802,5.0,I loved working for king soopers and then there was 1 manager that was very mean to me so i started to no like king soopers because i felt i was being treated unfairly so i quit.

King Soopers,1dnm4m5toh453800,3.0,A typical day was slightly hectic and our managers bounced us all over the place. I learned how to cashier and handle lots of different personalities. Also how to keep calm during stressful situations.
King Soopers,1dnlr1429h3le801,1.0,"King Soopers has a horrible life balance, they treat their employees like cattle. The union does nothing about complaints. You only receive any kind of worth while benefits if you started working there before 2012."
King Soopers,1dnkfop71h413802,1.0,The company really doesn’t care about it’s employees and skips out on simple needs for departments if it saves them a buck. Little respect for anyone on the bottom and upper management does little to nothing except say a department needs help and then starts to do a tiny job to appear to be helping. They do constant policy changes that they don’t tell anyone about until someone violates it and gets written up.
King Soopers,1dnitaj77h3h3800,2.0,Overall this job is easy; and that in itself is the problem. if you don't want to be challenged and want something that is not going to stress you then this place is for you.
King Soopers,1dng0gao1h3p2802,3.0,"I am outgoing, fun like to stay busy, I like to make people laugh, get to know customer's and the people I work with, love to spend time with my family,"
King Soopers,1dnflkeaoh3p2802,2.0,"My coworkers and head clerks made my life a lot easier and we’re on top of things. They were very fun and work oriented when they needed to be. However, upper management were bullies and didn’t care that much. My supervisor of the front end would bully me until I “proved myself worthy”. One of my assistant store manger had me , a female, clean the men’s restroom when the entire front end had male associates fully capable of the job. The main reason I left was because of this same manager. I passed out at work and she didn’t call for any help. I’m a minor with documented health issues."
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."
King Soopers,1dndi450pb89r802,3.0,"Benefits are good, pay is ok. Management needs an overhaul. Morale is low. Many employees, including management, lack work ethic so responsibilities are piled on the few who are there to work."
King Soopers,1dnc29522h412802,2.0,They do not care about the employees or customer. The only thing that matters is profit. The less employees you have the more you save. Why do you think there are so many self check outs?
King Soopers,1dn8gqv9nh452801,3.0,"Deciding where everyone is going to be and for how long they should be is the start of it All. That when decides where I will be at with me day. Dealing with all different type of emotions and attitudes through out your employees and customers. As being a manager you learn your attitude reflects on everyone else’s, positivity is always key, and everyday is a new day."
King Soopers,1dn88ttpmb82a802,4.0,"The job paid well, didn't like working the night shift, the job just didn't fit with my life style, never liked working nights, the people were nice to work with, everyone was helpful and hard working! They have a lot of discounts, not much chance to get holiday off, but it was a good job!"
King Soopers,1dn6m0g41h3t0802,1.0,Personally it wasn't bad when I started but over time the company started cutting department hours which in turn created severe under staffing. Which also resulted in horrendous work hours for everyone of 6 to 7 days a week even with a union. Along side the fact they hire at a low rate for the amount of work they expect done on night shift no less.  Management is another story altogether mostly a joke. Micromanaging with no help from them but your expected to do the work of 2 to 3 people most of the time.
King Soopers,1dn65tcjrh411802,2.0,No introduction to team members
King Soopers,1dn2vm1s9h3h1802,5.0,"Employment at King Soopers was a great, unique experience in the General Merchandise (GM) department. I very much enjoyed the time spent as a floor associate."
King Soopers,1dn1mdp58h3t0801,1.0,"We really all seem to dislike working there.  I like the two jobs I’ve had there—the day to day work—but the lack of humanity is awful.  The pay is bad, the benefits are good, the hours and lack of consideration for balance in our lives are terrible.  You’re expected to show up regardless of how sick you are.  Once I had a mandatory overnight shift when I was very sick with bronchitis."
King Soopers,1dn0ro4fsh451802,3.0,Career advancement s slow and only upper management is fairly compensated. After man years at this company I feel I can fairly rate management and employees alike.
King Soopers,1dn0e4cneh3t0802,5.0,I enjoy my work at Ling Soopers and I love my regular customers. Getting to know the customers on a personal level is fantastic. King Soopers is a great place to work.
King Soopers,1dmumu2mih451802,4.0,"A typical day includes me helping to stock shelves, help customers find items, bag items when checking customers out. Management is fairly understanding although it is difficult to get a set schedule due to their computer systems."
King Soopers,1dmu5jdn0h451802,4.0,"I worked at King Soopers for about 3 years. I loved my co-workers and management, as well as interacting with the customers. Work was fair, but i feel pay was too low, especially for anyone who was taught in multiple departments. I only left because a more competitive job was available."
King Soopers,1dmu0i3o1h451802,2.0,"The review summary says it all but this is likely common in the retail industry.  However, the fact that management does not back-up the department heads may be unique to this location.  I can't imagine all stores across Kroger are managed like this."
King Soopers,1dmttl749b85v807,2.0,"Great co-workers, but the management was constsntly changing and a giant mess. I was pulled from one position to another constantly and it was incredibly stressful. I had been in line for promotion for over a yearbut was never promoted for reasons beyond me and passed over in favor of other people who have not excelled in the position."
King Soopers,1dmpcph05h3gu802,3.0,I work in the front end and as far as starting for your first job here wouldn't be bad. They  are really understanding of schedules for minors and students in college. As long as you have a good reason they are understanding. Plus the people that you meet there become important to you and usually is the reason that some people stay. Everyone is usually really friendly with everybody as long as you do what you are supposed to. The longer you are there the better it is for you. For me though I just think that this job isn't for someone who wants to be financially stable unless you are there for a long time.
King Soopers,1dmnhokthh3st800,2.0,Each day at work is interesting and different. No two days are ever the same as peoples shopping habits are unpredictable. As manager I'm supposed to run the front end as well as do the office work and handle customer issues. I have learned how to manage my time and how to complete tasks in a timely manner as result of constant deadlines and seemingly having to be in retro places at once. Management is hit or miss and the company adds a whole is making questionable choices at the moment. The are a lot of great people I work with and making a customer's day is easily the best part of my day.
King Soopers,1dmlsikh5h3st804,5.0,"Wonderful place to work. Great manager, team members are awesome. Pay was great. Wish I would have never left"

King Soopers,1dmh1nqfth3sq800,1.0,"The company really doesn't care if you have a personal life or not, or if you're in school. The supervisors have their way almost majority of the time and can be unfair to those whom just got employed."
King Soopers,1dmcnnnmfh3gr800,2.0,Long term disability only lasted 2 years. They did not tell me until 1and a half years later. I had my Social Security reduced by 25% because I took long term disability 3 years away from age 66 retirement

King Soopers,1dktukjjc24f1004,1.0,"Well what can I say this company is garbage, I worked for king soopers for 9 years it was fun at first then it became more about making money then treating their people right. The management team where I worked sucked!!! They will not help you and throw you under the bus if they don't like you. Even after 9 years I was still only making 12$ an hour!  All I can say is do not waste your time!!!"

King Soopers,1dkh8pv64h40n800,3.0,12 hour days on average. With the fact they hired and fired people really fast even though I felt we needed the help. Got paid every week and was part of a union.
King Soopers,1dke58n5924fr007,3.0,"Management does not work with employees, you feel you are just a number in their system.  Customers rude, expect you to do everything for them, feel very pushed on a daily basis, with no help from other departments."
King Soopers,1dkceu1heh3og804,4.0,"I loved working there, even when I had two jobs. I wanted to be promoted and was ""guaranteed"" and interview within 30 days after submitting management application. After 2 and a half months not hearing anything, I put in my notice. I would say if you want to advance, you have to play the politics game and get friendly with the store managers."
King Soopers,1dkbtncnbh40l807,2.0,"The scheduling is based on seniority. You wont work any hours you want and will be forced to work hours you dont want. You will be forced to push carts for an hour, 3/4 times in your shift."
King Soopers,1dkbbbnjr24fq000,4.0,The staff at King Soopers were very understanding and friendly. It was easy learning how to use a cash register. The hardest part of the job was pushing carts while it was snowing. The most enjoyable part was talking and meeting new people.
King Soopers,1dk4kc4ckh3kg805,1.0,Joke of a management team zero training sink or swim mentality no core values lie right to your face! Don’t work with your home life can’t even give you a schedule on time then change it over and over and expect you to comply!!! Complete hole place to work ! Fire best employees after 35 years of service to save a buck!! No respect!!! Hate them!
King Soopers,1dk495fdih40l804,3.0,"Well King Sooper is fast paced and tuff but if you can handle then by all means apply... But if you are like me a full time college student with a constant changing schedule probably not the best place to work. They make it hard to work and go to school, yes you only work 20 hours a week give or take If you are full time college student it’s a lot to handle and it’s very hard to move up here and most of the time you get very rude and anger customers who come there but all most of the cashiers and other staff are very very nice and are amazing to work with."

You have to work until the job is done and more than half the crew spends one night in an aisle so they slack off while they make you do more and not even a thank you. The store manager is sexist and hates males and gives females extra benefits that the rest of us do not receive."
King Soopers,1dk1sgge8h3hr804,3.0,A Grocery store is a very busy environment. Staying busy can be very enjoyable and make the work day go by quickly. However corporate expectations are unrealistic and out of touch with the reality of a serviced based industry. There is not enough staff scheduled at any given time to address the needs of the store and it’s customers.
King Soopers,1dk1418vl24fq002,3.0,never enough help .either get called in early or stay late but don't get any overtime.many great employees you must be very flexible to work for this company
King Soopers,1djt8h0l324gj000,3.0,"The job was ok. It really depends on which store you work for. Upper management puts pressure on lower managers, which in turns adds pressure to everyone. The union was hit or miss. I saw them help people that truly needed the representation, but I never needed it, but was forced to pay for it."
King Soopers,1djt81bp5h3hn800,2.0,"Hi, veteran here. When I started at King Soopers, I was invigorated and excited to be a part of their team as I appreciated that they were pro employee satisfaction. As time went on, the dynamic of this place changed. It became very money driven. They cut employee hours, and doubled the workload on employees. After the Union negotiation recently, things shifted heavily. It is now solely money based. Upper management is pushing tasks on all employees that is beyond their realm of experience, throwing them into new departments with no formal training. Employees are getting injured more frequently due to lack of training on safe OSHA protocol. There is a clique system in each store, and if you don't become a scapegoat for upper management and get on their good side, you are constantly a victim of bullying from the team that manages you. Favoritism runs deep. Another point that I would like to add, is that unless you have put in a chunk of time working for this company, you are going to have a difficult time receiving time off or even the ability to get days off built around your schedule. Not flexible. Would not recommend working here."
King Soopers,1djt4mou4h3hn802,1.0,"The managers didn’t treat their employees fairly, they were rude and made certain employees work harder than others. Managers had employees do impossible tasks, and watch them struggle."
King Soopers,1djs301m2h3hn802,5.0,I loved working at King Soopers they promote with in and you can get promoted fairly quickly of your a hard worker and get the job done and depending on past employment experience you can get started with really good pay

King Soopers,1djkc0dkg24g0000,1.0,"If I could rate management lower than a one I would have, completely ineffective, hypocritical and disrespectful. Even if you have zero self worth and are really desperate for a job I would still go somewhere else. The whole company is s#$t."
King Soopers,1djk90hskh3h7802,5.0,"What a typical day of work would be bagging groceries for customers and keeping the carts full so customers wouldn't have to worry about having no carts. I learned how to work the cash register when we were low on cashiers and it was a busy day. The management was great and they were always on top of their game. Culture was very diverse and got to know interesting people. I'd say the hardest part would be when it would be snowing and people are rushing in to get food and supplies, but it would get easier as time past by."
King Soopers,1djjclssnh3h7802,1.0,"I worked in the deli here for three months. They were no up front with my wage, and it wasn't until my first paycheck that I was aware of my rate. They started me at the lowest possible rate for this position despite my experience."

King Soopers,1djf64amf52v1800,3.0,"To many tasks put on employees. Not enough hours or people to get everything done. They cut hours but, expect the enormous amount of work load to be done and if you work overtime you're written up. To much management but, none will ever jump in to help out a struggling department."
King Soopers,1djda8qrmh3vp806,3.0,The store I worked at had a policy where only the workers from one of the perishables department (produce or meat) could unload the nightly delivery trucks. And as the newbie I got a lot of those late shifts and had to deal with breaking down the load.
King Soopers,1djcfbogfh47j802,4.0,Presentation is important. Products should look good. Take pride in your work. Really enjoyed icing donuts. Being a people person is helpful. Working relationships were meaningful
King Soopers,1djap0ifmh3nt800,3.0,"At first, they give you tons of information without any breathers and then it gets easier. A simple task can get tiring over time if making it through 3 months."
King Soopers,1dj9i06dgh3nt807,3.0,It's a ok place to start working at but I would not work here forever because your hired on at part time and your hours are never solid unless you have seniority which means you have more years in the company then the rest of the people in the department your working in.
King Soopers,1dj8hv18rh3r3802,4.0,"Very fast pace which I like. I think the hardest part about it is that we required a little bit of more people but overall I liked what I did. The most enjoyable part was knowing we could make costumers life a little bit easier,."
King Soopers,1dj8dk0dch3n0800,2.0,Promised I wouldn't be transferred that was a lie called bad names and then got a no rehire when I said I wouldn't be back! Breaks and lunches are bull if your in management
King Soopers,1dj4rg1qfh3gh801,4.0,It was a good job when I was in high school and if I hadn't moved I would have stayed with them longer. When I needed more or less hours they made sure it happens.
King Soopers,1dj3l5p1ch43c800,2.0,"Overloaded work responsibility, not enough help to accomplish corporate expectations.  No assistance from Dept head. Constantly understaffed.

King Soopers,1diqtcdgvh43c800,2.0,I have worked here for over 11 years and my husband for over 20 years and we make good money for the area we live but not enough money for the stress we endure on a daily basis.
King Soopers,1dionkkooh3n0800,4.0,It's fun place to work but sometimes it's hard back there. Half the time your all by yourself back in or department. Sometime management will not be there to help you out.
King Soopers,1diohodp3h43c803,3.0,"It;'s a typical work environment. The place is very customer oriented with a company that refuses to give you full time unless you there long enough. I personally would prefer full time but I don't want to spend 20 years or so with Kroger to do that. Whenever they get busy or don't have enough people they ask you to stay but sometimes they pressure you to stay just to fill in for their system at the stores. But Kroger wants to hold their people at the minimum amount of hours possible. But the department managers ask if you want to stay later, come in early, and expect a yes for an answer regardless if you have plans etc. Our benefits change due to our union contracts expiring, employees want a new contract to benefit themselves and their lives which results us planing a strike if King Soopers DOES NOT agree with the contract the union and the employees want. But as any other grocery stores... Deal with customer,s move on, go on with the rest of your day before you go home."
King Soopers,1dio7dge0h3v0802,5.0,They're okay if you make an accident and do anyting sometimes they be yelling at you instead of dealing with their employer in a respectful and Manor way sometimes they have no respect when you make an accident and do something instead of them training you how to do it they'd rather have an employee train you and when you get something wrong they yell at you they don't see when you have a family emergency things happened in your family and they told me I can go see my family and when I got back they told me I was no longer working there it kind of heard of me because they should have understood that I had a family emergency
King Soopers,1dimi06f724ec006,1.0,"it was like being in a war for 13 years with all of their prejudice being held firm everyday. i would never work there again. nepotism, separatism from race to race. managers did not have concern for customers. it was horrible. i won the presidents award twice for my great service and the managers did not want me to be the winner of that especially not twice. they threw the winners board behind the soda machines after i won the presidents award title the second time. i was never respected while there."

King Soopers,1dikc2i2324ec000,4.0,Basic minimum wage job for courtesy clerk and cashiers. Three mains tasks that are simple and easily done. They are very flexible with your needs about working conditions. Also flexible with your personal life and scheduling.

King Soopers,1diaa0ro824ec002,5.0,King Sooners was a great place to work. The best part is I was taught how to decorate cakes on site and had a wonderful teacher I learned all my decorating skills from her
King Soopers,1di6tis5fh3qc800,1.0,They have no sense of structure. Upper management wants you to run your department all while being understaffed. And then by the lucky chance you do get staffed they do not provide your department with enough scheduling hours to even run it properly. It is a very very toxic work environment and would not recommend any to work here. I do have some friends here which makes it more bearable. Their insurance is pretty good as well and the only reason I stick around is for my daughters health insurance.
King Soopers,1di6b8rs7h3js800,2.0,"king soopers has a very seniority-based work environment. if youre new, dont expect time off any time soon. my manager kicked me out of her department right before hiring someone else behind the store managers back, which was against union policy. she recieved no repurcussions after her actions were found out. after this, the store would only offer me a demotion in pay.  it was either that, or i give my resignation. i havent seen a management department this poorly run in a long time. i wouldnt recommend this employer to anyone."
King Soopers,1di2pak0mh3qc800,2.0,The job itself itself isn't exceptionally difficult but they don't prepare you for it adequately. Expect a trial by fire and learning skills on your own.
King Soopers,1di12v4hqh42n800,3.0,"Kroger stopped caring about their associates.  To stay competitive with other businesses they are focused solely on customer convenience and satisfaction,  which is fine, but it was also at the expense of not retaining quality staff.  Employees were expected to learn and add new duties without proper training,  without increased compensation,  and whether or not they had sufficient staff."
King Soopers,1dhs4uajbh3ub804,3.0,"So for my first interview I felt good about going into the interview when I asked what previous experience I could get for the deli since I've worked in food service for most of my life I was shocked when I wasn't given any so I got to start out at 10.50 an hour and work my way up from there and in less than 6 months everything that I started with ended. When I started we had a full staff (about 12 people) and by November we were down to just 5 people this process would repeat itself 4 more times. Every time the deli would get a new manager and some new people we would train the new people and things would be fine for a couple months then the same thing would happen, people would start quitting and thinking about leaving I even started telling the management about when people are going to leave and they would tell me ""they wont do anything until they actually quit"". I was shocked I started having panic attacks because everyday turned into a struggle I wasn't enjoying myself at all so I decided to transfer to a new store after two years and two months when I arrived at the new store I was ready to work hard and leave the past behind me at my current store we currently have about 10 people and I say about because some people work at other locations or in Starbucks so our schedule may look full but it isn't. However the biggest reason I'm choosing to leave is because our stores are union and I don't have a problem with that however when our contracts were re-negotiated in January of this year we were all expecting a raise and I came to find out 5 months later that I wouldn't be"
King Soopers,1dhnherurh3js800,1.0,Worked as a cashier for 2 years. Many really young coworkers that are very lazy. I am shocked more customers are not complaining especially about delivery because many times items are left out of orders.
King Soopers,1dhk7gtdah3tp801,2.0,"Every day was a changelle to work. The head clerks were always running off and forgetting to tell people when they needed to take their breaks. On the busier days, they would send out all C.C.s to get carts and then customers would get angry because speed in the check out lanes would slow farther."
King Soopers,1dhh95k7ph425801,4.0,"King Soopers is great if you are in school and have a bit of a crazy schedule. In the end everything gets boring and the pay is just enough to survive, let alone pay off tuition debt."

King Soopers,1dha9vns4h45f802,4.0,King Soopers is an excellent grocery store as they come. They have an excellent meat section and a great variety organic produce. They carry organic items all over the store.  Excellent place to shop.
King Soopers,1dh7os89kh3lg800,3.0,It's a great business but the managers would all tell me different things to do and one manager would tell me my schedule and the other one would change it without telling me or the other manager. Breaks were really short and very few of them

King Soopers,1dh4oa2f3h3pk800,3.0,I did like my produce manager he was a awesome person but the stress of the store manager made it hard on him and all of us. But I enjoyed learning about produce and I didn’t mind hard work but some of the work was a little harder then most. If it wasn’t fir the wacky hours the seniority and not working with my schedule to fit my needs and the pay for the hard work then I would still be there
King Soopers,1dh496l2sb82g800,2.0,"Gonna be a long one. First and foremost i will say that every store is different so it doesn't mean you'll have the same experience at your store. Worked for KS for almost 5 years on the front end. There is so much to say i don't even know where to start. KS is a good place if you are just starting out and need a little experience, but don't expect to learn a whole lot in this job! Very unprofessional and doesn't teach much on how a real job works. The pay is not very good and takes way too long to build up enough to be a 'decent' wage. Work 1000+ hours to get a whopping 25-40c increase."
King Soopers,1dh35kvhuh459800,1.0,"This is the worst company I have EVER worked for.

King Soopers,1dgtdhonth3t1800,4.0,"As long as I did my job on time and did it adequatly, there would be no problems. I enjoyed my time there as long as I kept busy and did what was asked.

King Soopers,1dgqlu4rjbrdg800,1.0,Didnt really enjoy work and the upper management didnt know how to do simple things as give a proper times to work. Customers were not nice to a new person allow people to to learn its hard under pressure especially during the holidays.
King Soopers,1dgqat8tmh3t1802,1.0,I worked for king soopers for 23 years and lefted the company in February 2019 because I was not getting the training they promised me also it was always an issue to get two days off in a row and always a bad time to take time off mean while others seemed to get time off with less time with the company. Found myself hating my job that I had put some much into.
King Soopers,1dgm1p7r5h3p4800,4.0,King soopers is a great opportunity for students and/or young adults just entering the workforce. Many different deaprtments so there's a job for almost everyones skill set and experience level.
King Soopers,1dglkhp5ih3t1800,1.0,"The management at the store I worked at didnt care about me, my schedule outside of work, or anything that I wanted to do at work. My schedule would be changed with a moment's notice and often times i wouldn't be notified. My department I was being paid to work for was the front end as a courtesy clerk, a position that does everything in the store to a certain extent, and doesn't earn vacation time."
King Soopers,1dgli1tbtb85o800,3.0,Working for this corporation has been an experience with working in today's customer service.

King Soopers,1dg1rr5i924g4000,3.0,"If it weren’t for the amazing people that I have made friends with, I wouldn’t have stayed for 17 years! It did pay the bills and the benefits for the old contract are great! The cost of living increase didn’t mean a bigger pay increase though so a second job was needed to raise four kids. There is a lot of favoritism though and people that shouldn’t get promoted often do but I’m sure this happens a lot in retail."

King Soopers,1de57lub4h44u800,3.0,King Soopers is under poor management of minimum wage employees. They will take away your weekend nights for multiple weeks instead of scheduling fairly. My coworkers were friendly but the management seemed out of touch and always too busy to talk or help.
King Soopers,1de2jsk3424ft000,3.0,"A typical day of work at King Soopers consisted of a lot of uncertainty, frustration, and lack of communication. The management within King Soopers is very poor. They don't often connect with the employees below them, they believe that because they are above you that they don't have to do the ""dirty work"", and they will undoubtably work you overtime. The hardest part about the job was enjoying it and maintaining a life outside of work. I enjoyed the experience I got from working at King Soopers."
King Soopers,1de0mvalgh3oq800,3.0,"I spent my adult life working nights, weekends, and holidays. It cost me 2 marraiges. The medical benefits kept me there. I am very grateful for my pension.

King Soopers,1ddp5b2tb24fg000,2.0,"I started as a courtesy clerk in 2014. Eventually got tired of  working upfront and got promoted to bakery clerk in 2015. I was trained on almost everything. I became the most reliable clerk. Eventually the hours got cut,  like they do every year, and I was tired of 20 to 25 hours a week at 12.50 an hour. Finally put in my papers and I got promoted in my store and didn't have to transfer. I didn't have much to learn because I knew mostly everything. Fast forward to now, it's awful. New processes, hours being cut, no help. I have no time for breaks and barely time for a lunch. I usually work on my lunch because they expect schedules to be done on mondays (which I'm not supposed to do them because I'm an assistant. ). If I take my breaks and lunch, nothing will get done because there is so much to do and no help. They cut my hours and I'm expected to fill all the cases on the sales floor, fill all the tables(which I have stuff through the store), do markdowns by 9am, break my frozen load down, and have everything full by 9am or 8am on weekends. They expect full shelves constantly even though I can't help we rely on system to forecast what the tables need and order most of my stuff that's frozen. High expectations from upper management and corporate. My store managers are decent. Most of them come to help without a fit. It's funny how I can't have my clerks scheduled the way I need them but they can keep me on overtime almost everyday to finish everything. These corporate people have NO idea what it's like to work in these departments. Working here is like being in a prison, honestly."
King Soopers,1ddor5ad624gh000,4.0,"The work over at King Soopers is bearable. Somedays it is easy to get a grasp on my activities but other times I felt overburdened. Also with my disability, it is difficult to communicate with customers at times."

King Soopers,1ddlqa6t224fg000,3.0,"It’s not bad to work here however if you are part time but get use to working 40 hours for a while it sucks to suddenly have your hours cut which is what happened to me. It’s best to get that full time status as quickly as you can if you need. Management really depends on the location you work at some are nicer and more caring than others while some are not very understanding and have unreasonable expectations. It’s a quick paced environment and your days usually go by pretty quick, good benefits, just a lot of drama between workers also depending on what store you are at. Overall would recommend as a starting job, but not so much for someone who wants a forever home job. It gets tiring and old after a while ."
King Soopers,1ddk7eamu24g3000,2.0,"When I started, they refused to use any of my prior experience as job credit so I started at there minimum pay and in over a year and a half, I wasn't even being paid more than people who were just starting because minimum wage had increased in the state. They had me desk op for over a year with now intention of getting me a promotion to a head clerk. SO I did the job of a head clerk for that time at my regular wage where as actual head clerks made over $17/hour."

King Soopers,1ddfjdtvgh473800,1.0,"King Soopers is filled with mean-spirited, martinet managers who like nothing better than a good scream at someone they supervise.  If not a good scream, sometimes with contorted smiling face, these misfit managerial moo-moos enjoy condescending to their underlings between stippled, swollen lips -- hissing like vipers on a power trip.  No people skills.  You will be told to keep your bathroom breaks short, and they will be timed.  Bathroom breaks will be announced to all and sundry as ""potty breaks"", yes --  in front of customers by Front End Supervisors who look like Gidget but act like Godzilla's Girlfriend. Miicro-managing every move you make.  There is a sense that things are hopeless and only getting worse.  Top managers come and go.  Chaos reigns as you are not really trained to do your job, but are berated when you make a small error.  You will be paid next to nothing and will not get medical benefits for at least a year.  That's right, a YEAR.  Your schedule requests will be disrespected time and time again.  You can ask for the hours you want. That's a good thing.  Don't expect to get them.   There are rumors that some managers enjoy making employees work more or less than they request, that they actually give more hours to people who ask for less, and less to those who ask for more.  It's preverse, but the supervisors appear to get kicks from making their employees miserable."
King Soopers,1ddbq1npgh3n6800,3.0,A lot of drama here. Managers are rude to less than employee's. Getting time off is hard. Must ask for 3 weeks in advance.
King Soopers,1dd6c5pnf5nb6800,4.0,Not a bad place to work.I'd do it again.It's a standard retail establishment. The living wage is difficult to explain.  It's no longer a 'one person works' type situation.

They are disrespectful and never are willing to listen to the employee let alone care about them at all. Even if severely ill they want to force doctors appointments which are expensive and unaffordable on the pay they give and make anything the employee want to do a hassle such as even getting a day off.

King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."
King Soopers,1dc752vrk24fv000,4.0,It was fun working there when I did but I couldn't see myself my doing this everyday for the rest of my life. Overall good place to start out or to build your resume.
King Soopers,1dc61i97eh3kh800,5.0,The work place was very diverse. Great management and amazing coworkers. Very team oriented. Flexible schedules and overtime if needed or wanted. Training and teaching was excellent. Pay and raises was amazing. Great company to work for.
King Soopers,1dc3ch05nbrd2800,4.0,"Currently working there for  the past thirty-one years, I have grown to love the customers who shop there. Some days are more challenging then others depending on the time of the month. What I have learned is to have plenty of patience, especially with the change of time and technology. One of the hardest part of my job is dealing with the elderly, when trying to download apps to their phones for additional savings. I have seen many managers come and go, many I had a great rapport, and some I didn't care for but respect their position."
King Soopers,1dc2pjlq224ed000,1.0,I went to King Soopers on the recommendation from a family member believing that this would be a great career path.  The thought was to grow and learn throughout and move up to manager and so on.  The compensation was poor along with management and scheduling.
King Soopers,1dc0k8duq24fe000,4.0,Stocking shelves and assisting customers
King Soopers,1dbr9lnhmb88l800,3.0,I'm not quite sure if there's some kind of disconnect with upper management But there's not a lot of Appreciation coming from them for the work that you do to and more Net picking I'm what you're doing wrong A not coaching you through it Or giving you the benefit of the doubt It is their word over yours every time Regardless if you are right and they are wrong It is a good place to work but I would like it if the management were a lot better.
King Soopers,1dbqem9i124f9004,5.0,i enjoyed working at kingsoopers for the most part. Some days were stressful but it wasn't anything i couldn't handle. The people were great had no issues asking questions. I learned there how to use a cash register and to handle money.
King Soopers,1dblcs1gubrcm800,1.0,"The manager fired me because I looked like his ex wife, words out of his mouth. Bad corporation. They make you push carts in 0 degree weather for 3 hours at a time."
King Soopers,1dbjfers724fp000,3.0,There were ups and downs to this job. There are always customers and during the day it is always busy. Good co-workers and managers made this job tolerable.
King Soopers,1dbivhmj024e9000,3.0,Job pay is ok when compared to what has to be done.  Not knowing when you are going to get released from work is not good.  This happens daily.  Crewman were not allowed to leave until entire store was conditioned.  Sometimes managers left without even letting you know you were released from work.
King Soopers,1dbeh5c2o24e3004,3.0,Typical corporate mindset focussed on the bonuses earned by those way above you. Belief that the only way to make money is on the backs of the workers. Sets scheduling hours too low to truly meet the needs of the customers.
King Soopers,1dbcakest24f3000,2.0,They promote the wrong people causing stress on everyone else it depends on who you know and who you blow to move up. Always changing policy and trying new projects that don’t work and try to fit 16 hours of work into 8
King Soopers,1db5n462824f3000,2.0,"King Soopers as a whole doesn't seem to care about life outside of work. They expect you to be in the store to accomplish the tasks at hand, but they expect you to do this with no overtime and with minimal staff. They waste time and resources hiring and training new staff just to turn around and fire them for a failed drug test instead of waiting for those tests to come back before starting the training process."
King Soopers,1db3j4n4t24eh000,4.0,"A typical day (actually, night) at work for me is fast-paced, but not hectic."
King Soopers,1das492pf5ndr800,1.0,"Too much work and not enough people, but they dont care just get it done or write up. Have impossible standards that no human could meet. If you're friends with management that's how you get promoted, not merit based, it's how much you suck up the store manager. Problems, concerns, dont worry, they wont care."
King Soopers,1dargvrcb52te800,5.0,It’s a great place but it can overwhelming sometimes even in Sunday’s cause of the Denver Broncos games are sometimes on at Sunday’s but in other words it’s great
King Soopers,1dara7934h3pn800,4.0,It was ok people were good easy to learn some managers were easy going and good to work with others were lazy and would talk to certain costumers for 20 minutes to an hour
King Soopers,1daqgv7j5h3hr800,3.0,"They reward people for staying, not for working hard; if a 2-year cashier could work any role in the store, they can be paid less than the 50-year cashier who only runs self-checkout."
King Soopers,1daoqqp3a52t7800,4.0,Yes if I did not have to move I would have stayed u start at 10 work for 10 hours would stock shelves and clean up 5 days a week got paid twice a week
King Soopers,1dafat5ish3pe800,1.0,Poor place to work. Have to wait 13 months for medical benefits. No match on 401k if you are Union.
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."

King Soopers,1d9tfhiulh3h8800,3.0,"I learned how to be an employee while working at King Soopers. As this is my first job, I try to do what is needed and work hard while I am on the clock during every shift I'm scheduled to work."
King Soopers,1d9d691v1h453800,1.0,You have no chance of getting full time hours here. The management will tell you that you will get the hours soon so you will stay. Management plays favorites. Overall negative environment. Hours being cut regularly but they force you to stay on mandatory overtime when they need you.
King Soopers,1d991lncqh3gm800,1.0,i would not recommend working for this company. they do not work with you . nothing is ever good enough for this company . they do not care about their employees.
King Soopers,1d98qqkh9h40q800,1.0,"Dont work here unless you can take getting yelled at , if you expect managment to be on your side. Think again i would not work here if i could get another job. Very unorganized very unfair and not a loyal bunch of people.its not just one manager its all of them they think there so much over everyone. There just rude and very hateful.  Night crews fault for everything. Management got there jobs in a cracker jack box .. not one manager in upper management has never helped night crew they just sit upstairs and  talk about how bad night crew is. And how they walk circles around everyone. They walk in circles alright but not around us. Never a Thank you,."
King Soopers,1d966g1tuh40q800,3.0,"Department management was great but seemed to have no managerial power as they were often ""run over"" by upper management. Lack of teamwork and communication. Loved the work and my customers, hated the high school drama games."
King Soopers,1d8pafblf1ai8000,3.0,"Hardest job is being a courtesy clerk at Kingsoopers, based on customers mainly... dress code is way too strict, there is no expression allowed for employees"
King Soopers,1d8ojpjj1h40h800,4.0,"The people at King Soopers were ok, I did end up making good friends. The management was pretty ok they let me go on vacation whenever my parents planned a trip so they were flexible."
King Soopers,1d8m96cl21ago000,4.0,"King Soopers is a great company to work for! It was my first union job and I'm still not sure if that's a good thing or not. Some of the people in my particular store liked to play favorites, and that is unfortunate when that is allowed to happen in a work place environment."
King Soopers,1d8kjerph1agi000,2.0,"Great starting job. Management was horriable and made promises that were never kept and lead to myself ultimately leaving due to the fact. Otherwise, its a okay first job."
King Soopers,1d8ki2siq1ai3000,4.0,It was okay.  Working at Walmart would just be Easier for me and my family. It’s closer and I would rather work in a Walmart environment. I was referred by many people.
King Soopers,1d8kcen4o1ah8000,2.0,The daily tasks aren’t too difficult and other than busy periods the work load is fair. The management can be unprofessional at times but overall it’s bareable
King Soopers,1d8euqoc01agi000,3.0,"Perhaps not the best place for a permanent job, but definitely a good step in the correct direction and makes a good first job that teaches work ethic and minor management skills."
King Soopers,1d8d4q40q1aia000,3.0,Working there I had gotten real close to my customers and cried when I left even had customers tell me they were going to stop shopping there is I wasn't there . I loved the people I worked with and got along with everyone

King Soopers,1d81vnvjv1ba9000,5.0,Great for all levels and departments.  Well organized company and clean environment.  HR is very professional. Great communication within all management.
King Soopers,1d7v8h81g24e5000,4.0,This store is super busy and really fast pace. It can sometimes be a stressful place but for the most part they are a pretty good place to work. You have to be able to mesh with a lot of different people
King Soopers,1d7uudg0k1ahr000,5.0,"Being able to see customers and being able to make sure they had the satisfaction of their shopping trip, and being able to communicate with the customers and being sure you can help them if they have a problem."
King Soopers,1d7uspp5i1ahc000,3.0,Overall this job is good. I like the people who I work with and enjoy the customers. The pay and the management were the issue mostly. I have worked for king soopers for almost 2 years and am still getting pay at minimum wage. This didnt change when I brought up that I have worked more than 1000 hours which is the minimum amount of hours need to work for a payraise.
King Soopers,1d7sgu2pi24ei000,5.0,I need a place where I can expand my horizons and opportunity’s to grow as a person. I love working there I just need a place where I can grow not only as a person but as a worker in this society.
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."
King Soopers,1d5v63t7c24gv000,3.0,"Overall King Soopers is a good employer and advancement is semi-consistent. If you work hard and prove yourself, moving up in the company is possible. You are able to start off at minimum wage and move your way up to the District Manager roll or even higher. They pay for college and provide good benefits. However, the shifts are very inconsistent. Every week my shifts change along with my days off in the week. The work place is fast and you are always busy, whether it be cleaning or stocking. There is always work needed to be done. Can be a stressful job for juggling multiple tasks and getting them done in a timely manner."
King Soopers,1d5usts8jak4n800,3.0,A typical beginning of my shifts starts with completing peoples orders. Later in the day I  bring orders to peoples cars and explain any items we had to give an alternative item to or take an item off their order due to not having it in stock. I learned full on customer service as well as multitasking. Management in my specific department was great but outside of my department was very poor and I was treated poorly by them. The hardest part of the job is the way I was treated by other employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was the support I received for struggles within the workplace.
King Soopers,1d5nfhcb5b80n800,3.0,"King Soopers is a great place for task driven, focused people who want to learn and apply themselves. It is what you make of it, in a way. If you dedicate yourself as a dependable associate, willing to learn and take on more responsibility, you can elevate yourself as far as you really want. The compensation for store management and above is certainly livable with a decent incentive bonus, albeit with shaky criteria. Unfortunately, the culture of upper management can be thankless and borderline toxic at times. You will find yourself pursuing unattainable store perfection at all times, with no credit given."
King Soopers,1d5kj4jno1bge000,3.0,"I enjoyed creating boquets, and helping customers, but never made any advancement and had to continue with my schooling. They would not budge with scheduling."
King Soopers,1d5h6h2cd1bge000,4.0,"Good money for the work environment. Would recommend for this reason. Full time commitment and living wage, health BENEFITS. Other than that, it is what it is, a grocery store."
King Soopers,1d5g40klq1ahu000,3.0,"This job is fantastic for getting on your feet and to get yourself moving in a good direction.  They give discounts on Kroger products only.  They say they are extrelmely flexible with peoples schedules but if you even mention requesting a day off they will get up in arms about it.  Managment is friendly overall but some do a poor job ""managing.""  they can often times pick favorites as well."
King Soopers,1d5di1ojmak4h800,4.0,This company is great for anyone looking for a first job. This helped me develop better customer service and people skills which is crucial for any job.
King Soopers,1d593pqf21bge000,3.0,"The job itself was not that fun but coworkers were enjoyable to be around. Working in the deli the pay was not great and often felt like it did not match the amount of work put in, especially when running a shorthanded department."
King Soopers,1d55d6idv1bab000,3.0,Department hours are not spread out according to which department needs it the most. Its extremely stressful because almost every department is understaffed. The people who are in the department are expected to pick up the same amount of work as if they had been fully staffed. Everyone is very overworked.
King Soopers,1d4t51o831agi000,2.0,"The company has been around for a long time. But that doesn't mean they know how to take care of their employees. Management at my store has always been ok. Nothing more, nothing less. The pay is pretty terrible and you have to deal with every type of person. And Our Union has been absolutely terrible. In the several months they have had to do their job they have nothing to prove. The best part of the job is going to be the co-workers you will have. You will like some of them and you will hate some of them. This job is okay looking on paper but in practice its pretty terrible. Its just like communism."
King Soopers,1d4r3bil11bg2000,2.0,"Due to the fast-paced nature of the grocery business, I found my experience with King Soopers to be enjoyable . The only thing that I did not enjoy was being on my feet for several hours for a day."

King Soopers,1d4mepmdaaqgu800,5.0,I liked how people were concerned and were so understanding bout a lot of things. They actually listened to their employees. They always made sure that they were doing their job right
King Soopers,1d4mcceagakh4800,1.0,"Needs new management. Under payment is just an understatement: I've been underpaid many times for clocking in a minute early/late from lunch, it's very stressful, rude coworkers/customers. You must work there a year before you receive any kind of benefits, holiday pay is twenty cents more an hour (I made a dollar extra on my paycheck for working on thanksgiving.) Overall, was the least professional company I've ever worked for."
King Soopers,1d4ld8l12ak96800,5.0,If you dont work for kingsoopers when you get a chance your crazy. Its union based job and they pay weekly. I would love to go back to my old contract if I could get hired back
King Soopers,1d4jog36sak55800,3.0,Most coworkers were good to work with but the upper management has no idea the ins and outs of what the employees on the floor do. They come down and try to tell everyone to change what they are doing but have no idea the actual work being done because they don't see it happening.
King Soopers,1d4hkst58aqgr800,3.0,Good pay and benefits in union stores. Downfall is overload of work 10 hours of work in an 8 hour period. Management isn’t always the greatest and no one has your back
King Soopers,1d4dtf4mmak93800,3.0,"The pay is worth it, I worked with some really good people. Some really good benefits and the   hours are nice."

King Soopers,1d45pua3bak52800,5.0,"Very busy, sometimes you worked alone. I learned how do western union transactions, money order machine and, bill paying. Management was great, always helpful very appreciative. The hardest thing was difficult customers. I enjoyed meeting new people, enjoyed my co-workres."
King Soopers,1d41grll9ak8m800,3.0,reasonable workplace with flexible hours to acommodate a decent work/life balance. Union vs. company issues cause a rift between management and associate. Decent pay at upper levels.
King Soopers,1d4153t88ak8m800,4.0,"A typical day of work includes managing up to 25 employees breaks and lunches, picking up/loaning money, doing paperwork, and providing quality customer service. In management you are required to lead your team, and provide knowledge to customers on products as well as company policy."
King Soopers,1d4136nfvak8m800,3.0,I typical day of work is doing your job and another persons job as well.
King Soopers,1d3v70vm1ak8m800,4.0,Great company to work for with lots of room with advancement. Fast paced environment. Scheduling can be a little inconsistent. But gets better as you gain seniority
King Soopers,1d3qdiif5ak8m800,3.0,"It always depends on which store you are working at. Some are full of very friendly people and personable managers. There are raises and oppurtunities for advancement. Pay tops out at a certain point, though it takes years to reach it.. For my area, the maximum pay for employees on the floor or managers is okay. After a raise it could pay for living wages. Definitely a great job oppurtunity for students"
King Soopers,1d3mgi6foak4l800,3.0,"Managers do half the work of the cashiers and baggers and most are not very understanding. I did like the store owner at my location and the fast paced environment makes the job enjoyable. It's what you make of it, I personally love talking to customers (no, I'm not joking)"
King Soopers,1d3iaigg5ak8i800,4.0,Lack of career advancement opportunities even though I was highly qualified. applied for 2 advancement opportunities and I was denied for both. promotion given unfairly

King Soopers,1d3fbea7e1d0t000,3.0,"It's rare to find a good manager, co-worker, or employee here. When said person is found most leave so very few even move up. Favoritism is a big issue here, some have been denied promotions over other's because of favoritism"

King Soopers,1d3an189gak4h800,3.0,"A living nightmare, in short- everyone was selfish, and unwilling to help you (including management); I should have quit a lot sooner than I did. Sorry not sorry."
King Soopers,1d3829g6b1baf001,3.0,Worked most of my career in management and cant move up past department head due to the fact they choose who they like best rather then who is more qualified for the job.
King Soopers,1d34msqidak8i800,3.0,"I would clock in and check the schedule. I learned how to properly bag groceries, stocking shelves, maintenance, gathering carts, exchange propane tanks, how the dairy department worked. I seemed to do ok with management. A good mix of all age groups working together. Trying to advanced and not being allowed to. Meeting people and learning new things."
King Soopers,1d302qqn61d0n000,4.0,Friendly people always smiling. Everyone worked together to make customers experience fast and efficient. I learned how to properly bag like items together
King Soopers,1d2u5q31r0mtp000,4.0,Management was supportive. Coworker was sometime drama out but other then that very friendly and helpful. No one lets you struggle if you need help mostly anyone can help you in the store that works there.
King Soopers,1d2qrcsst1ai7000,5.0,King Soopers has many opportunities for growth if you show you are willing to work. The probationary period is very strict so if you mess up in your first month you can almost guarantee you'll lose your job.
King Soopers,1d2jtk49t1ba6000,2.0,The environment is fast paced which is a nice thing. But a lot of the time we are short staffed and cant keep up with the fast pace environment. Management is new so there is a lot of issues within management and the basic knowledge of the managers. While working at King Soopers for two years I did not have any raises or really any growth within the company.
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."

King Soopers,1d2b5vcphb89r801,5.0,my time at king soopers I was a courtesy clerk and we were always very busy but it was never that stressful because there were always enough people to take care of it
King Soopers,1d2avkbo4aqhf800,2.0,I did not get to work there for very long as they had hired to many people for the jobs available. There was not very much room for growth in the industry and not many people enjoyed their job.
King Soopers,1d2ahd4cdb860800,1.0,Don't care for their employees! Employees are like family. Healthcare is good. Don't get to close to any one keep to your self. Don't do anything out of your way because you don't get paid to do extra at this job.
King Soopers,1d287mljlaqhc800,1.0,five years they dont vaule their employess it is a hard place to work at when theres alot of call offs long term it can be good money five years down the line for new employees enless you become a manger than sooner
King Soopers,1d2606qkcb85t800,4.0,"If you love to talk to people all day, a cashier job is the job for you. I enjoyed the hours which were pretty regular and I enjoyed the talkative customers who made life easy."
King Soopers,1d22q5o4aak9i800,4.0,you get a paycheck every Thursday. you get to meet new people every day. learn new things every day. get a 10 percent discount of certain products and food. but the hardest part is multi tasking when bosses tell you to do certain things at certain times. and other people are just standing around not doing their own part of teamwork of the typical business day. mostly have to work on weekends and different shifts if you don't have seniority
King Soopers,1d1ugo9jobrdk800,1.0,A typical night we unloaded and stocked and conditioned shelves. Learned how to organize. The management was ok but the job culture was not good. We never had enough help and yet we were expected it to be done by a time too early so consequently we always had to work overtime. The most enjoyable part was getting to know my team members
King Soopers,1d1ma49ldak96800,1.0,They play favorites and promise promotions only if you do something for them. Store managers and assistant store managers don’t talk to employees unless approached by employee. Some head clerks don’t know what they are doing or how to act after they get promoted they are lazy. We don’t get paid what we are worth. Biggest thing in this company is it’s not what you know it’s who you know. Good job security because of the union. The only reason I haven’t left is because of the union local 7 UFCW. This could be a good place to work if managers and company actually cared about they’re employees. Don’t know if this is every store or just mine.
King Soopers,1d1k94o1saqh1801,4.0,"Although in my department myself and the rest of the team did our work in a timely manner and where very productive and had so many customer compliments, there just wasn't good leadership or direction from managers throughout the entire store all leading up to the store manager. But i really did enjoy working there."
King Soopers,1d1hf1bkpak96800,4.0,"The typical day is usually pretty busy, lots of customers, always a chance to talk to and meet new people. I have learned how to talk to people and make good impressions. The most enjoyable part of the day is talking to the customers."
King Soopers,1d1hcgmn5as17800,4.0,"The grocery market is complex, competitive, and highly unstable. American Retail customers are among the most difficult people one could meet, and Kroger's product policies enable further belligerent behavior, but I do understand why such strong steps were taken to advance customer service and CRM relations."
King Soopers,1d1ctdmu0aqh1800,5.0,"I was a cashier at king soopers for 7 to 8 years, I loved my job and had regular customers come to my line on a regular basis that became my friends. I am available for rehire if I wanted to"
King Soopers,1d19t9mlgb89g800,4.0,I got in as just a Clerk and could have easily kept moving up. The pay for management is very worth it. Great benefits. Lots of training and classes. Great Culture.
King Soopers,1d19i41fsakh0800,4.0,"King soopers is a good place to work, but the union can be a huge detriment to being able to work there for long. The union demands that employees are given hours based off how long they have been with thecompany, so a useless employee with 10 years of uselessness will get more hours than the new guy who works hard."
King Soopers,1d17kmnreb81f800,1.0,When I first started it was great but over the years it became a favorites game and began to not care about their employees. You must play the game and be a favorite and play foosball

King Soopers,1d0vgkrv4as11800,3.0,"Great if your department has co-workers who are team players. Fun customers which usually outweigh the bad ones. Stressful due to the volume of customers and when mgmt doesn't provide you with what you need. Nice appreciative lunches, atta-boy recognition when customers give great reviews on their surveys."
King Soopers,1d0v0k46pas11800,5.0,"I worked in the Deli, cutting meat, using machines, serving customers wants and needs. Cleaned up the deli every night and always did my best to do better everyday."
King Soopers,1d0sa8d6aas11800,5.0,I loved working at King Soopers. Great friendly management. Management will work with you on your schedule or if you're sick. Give you great hours if you ask for them.
King Soopers,1d0q9dqt1as11800,4.0,"More tasks are expected to be completed with less time to do it. Hiring people is not as easy as it used to be, because of this. Overtime is more often than not required to finish everything required, but overtime is not allowed. Training new people is a time consuming task that does not always provide a worker who has a sense of urgency. I enjoy helping the customers and working with the coworkers. The work load can make it hard to enjoy either of those things some days. My immediate manager is someone I feel I can go to about my concerns. The store management on the other hand is not always people I feel care about what my concerns are."
King Soopers,1d0o95ah81ahv000,4.0,King Soopers is a very diverse and great company to work for. The benefits help more than half of the employees a great amount. Management always takes care of any issues with care and patience.
King Soopers,1d0nc4e9d1bgf000,2.0,You are asked to do more then any person should have to do in a 8hr shift. Sometimes hard to get the vacations you want or days off that you request. Store Mangers and assistance store mangers get rotated every 2 years so you have to get use to things changing at the store a lot.
King Soopers,1d0ldpou41bgf000,3.0,"Sack groceries while talking to the customer. Making sure he found what he was looking for. Making sure what type of bag they wanted. If needed take the cart out to their car. When I went to service desk, It was customer service all the way. Cashed checks, do returns, sell and cash lotto tickets. I trained on Western Union and followed policy guidelines to send or receive. The job is not hard to learn and for the most part enjoyed the customers"
King Soopers,1d02gphm10mtf000,5.0,"My responsibilities at King Soopers was help bag groceries to cashier, return groceries back where they belonged, recover shopping carts from out side and sweeping and moping."
King Soopers,1d02cif6c1ahv000,3.0,"A typical day is fast paced and much work to be completed.  Heavy lifting at times (50 lbs or less) Balancing your time is critical. My co workers are fun to work with for the most part. Helping customers with their needs is satisfying. There is a large community of homeless at this location.  While compassion is very important, personal safety is a concern. Dealing with this has been the hardest part of my Job."
King Soopers,1cvu6mro81bgf000,3.0,It was a great experience but it wears on you after a while. They needed man power so they hired some pretty terrible workers. This means others work twice as hard as they need to and it was a pain. I fealt like a literal hercules performing task for not just one department but 3 or 4 at the same time. I had fun with friends I made there but it was a rough and grueling experience. Most of my managers were experienced and good at their job. The company doesn't offer benefits to teens they acact like they dont want their help at the store due to the limited window during the week we could change schedules and we were all at school.
King Soopers,1cvru1grt1ahv000,4.0,"Clock in, count drawers to make sure your drawer wasn't over or short, get to the assigned register, wipe area, get started scanning items, bag if needed, take payment, give change"
King Soopers,1cvr2jacp1ahe000,5.0,"It is a great first job for teenagers to work in, people are mostly friendly, co workers are friendly, jobs are fairly easy, managers are all caring and very polite."
King Soopers,1cvc1c5tl1aie000,4.0,"Though the work is occasionally difficult, most places will have a team worth working with to get it done. The only major drawback to the job is that many managers are promoted for the sake of filling the position rather than rewarding the people most qualified for it."
King Soopers,1cv1n6vk41ai6000,2.0,"If there are issues you will never know until the end. There's no management communication, with upcoming changes, to employees.  The employee is always wrong. The customer never lies."
King Soopers,1cuv9mmn11agl000,4.0,"My co-workers and my managers were very supportive in everything and allowed me to do a variety of different jobs within the store, even though i was not supposed to be doing any of them. i have learned too much to put here.  everyday was the same as the last, excitingly enjoyable.  everyone was very enthusiastic and supportive. the hardest part was the cart pushing, due to my bad back, while the most enjoyable was the variety of things that i got to do."
King Soopers,1cuumemcu1agl000,1.0,"I have never known a company that is literally dying for people to work there, yet they treat their employees horribly mainly because management sucks. They do not communicate with you or each other, they are quite rude when it comes to helping you learn, they discipline employees on the floor in front of customers, they are beyond strict when it comes to breaks, HR does absolutely nothing to resolve complaints, they will not ask if it ok for you to stay late, work another shift, etc. they just demand that you do it. I was cussed at by 3 different managers on 3 separate occasions in front of a customer including being called stupid. They gossip, chose favorites, don't follow procedure. I absolutely loved the customers, but Kings/Kroger really needs to do something about management. They don't even require a drug test and they still can't get people to work there!"
King Soopers,1cuqhipba1ai6000,4.0,I enjoyed all things about this job except the balance of work and life. Management seems to think the job will become your career when some of the employees wish to move on to higher goals.
King Soopers,1cupr39pd1ai6000,2.0,it was a job. it paid my bills and my co workers were nice. I was very sick with my first child and they was very understanding. I was able to take as much time as I needed off and I came back when I was feeling well. Management did not judge me and I felt a part of the team
King Soopers,1cun26mbv1agl001,1.0,"Retail customer service.  Barely above minimum wage pay, limited hours, dealing with customers, lousy benefits.  I took the job because I needed it out of desperation."

King Soopers,1cudotii1akj2800,1.0,You could work at a place that not only treats you with more respect. But you could find a job that pays you better. I suggest that people not make a career out of king soopers
King Soopers,1cud70pk3as3d800,2.0,It's overall an okay place to work as long as you choose the right department to work in. Customers can be really rude but all you can do is keep a smile on your face and keep walking. all the upper managers are horrible in my store sometimes you'll get some good upper management.
King Soopers,1cucchcbbb80i800,4.0,lots of people to meet there. It gets very busy on the weekends and on holidays. The enjoyable part is being able to help a customer find an item in the store and them talking to your manager about how awesome you are
King Soopers,1cu9osl78akf3800,1.0,"Fun until the best friends come along. To much  seniority, you can work yourself to death but at the end of the day. They don’t care and you won’t get treated with the respect you show you deserve. By only some manigment. Others are only getting paid what they treat you like. Lots of drama, and you’ll end up putting most effort."
King Soopers,1cu8buetnakf3800,2.0,"Kingsoopers, by far, is one the more horrible places to work. When you think union, you think safety. That wasn’t the case at all. The higher up managers where the only “safe” ones. Our turn over rate at our store was horrendous. If you decide to work for kingsoopers stay away from the grocery area (even though it’s the only area with hours). Stay far away. 12+ Hr shifts. With one day off a week and you’ll be working for people who are under qualified for the position. Store managers and assistance managers, alike, have a huge ego, and WILL belittle you, regardless if you’re  doing a good job. I could go on for days about how poorly ran this company is. But I’ll leave it there."
King Soopers,1cu854lcpbrfv800,2.0,"Always short handed. Managers are lacking in experience, common knowledge, and drive to work. Manager stands around waiting employees work. Company often put itself and customers over own employees."
King Soopers,1cu229fulakbu800,2.0,Don’t work here if you don’t enjoy being harassed by upper management for things out of your control.
King Soopers,1cu1uh39bakj2800,4.0,"My day begins at 4:00 am.  I scan the sales floor to determine immediate needs to the weekly sales areas and high visibility displays.  I ""break down"" the load and place product in the storage racks or on produce carts as appropriate for the sales floor needs."
King Soopers,1ctve8rstakbs800,3.0,It's an okay place to work. There are many issues but it's usually good. I have worked there for nine years and have had only a few problems with the company.
King Soopers,1ctr4h09qb8bu800,4.0,"I worked for King Soopers for over four years and I learned a lot about customer service, meat slicing, and meat cutting. I liked my time in Colorado but I transferred to the one store in Wyoming and it I could not adjust to the way it was ran."
King Soopers,1ctqu9ei7brft800,3.0,"Fast paced for courtesy clerks. Pleasant, time goes fast.  Regular breaks and very organized work floor. Lots of safety protocols. The customers are always pleasant at checkout."
King Soopers,1ctlge9sf1d0e000,4.0,The typical day depends on which department you work in.I work in the dairy so for me I stock all the dairy products and help customers find items in the store.
King Soopers,1ctghcce6akeu800,4.0,Unloaded trucks for meat department. Stocking the cases with product. Breaking down the loads. Organizing and ordering product. Marking down items that were ready to expire. The most important part was keeping our customers happy. I was the best at it.
King Soopers,1ctgato6paqj3800,4.0,"They over worked you and have the legal ability to keep you at least an hour over the tome you’re scheduled for so just because it says you’ll get off at a certain time you can’t argue that because they can keep you even later than you’re scheduled for, you have to give a heads up at the beginning of your shift or sooner that you want to leave on time today."
King Soopers,1ctau2si2aqj0800,4.0,Not enough hours or pay to make a living unless you were in management. Mr review would not shed a good light on the company as a whole and would need to upgrade its policies to include a living wage
King Soopers,1ct91ieugaker800,2.0,"Decent pay, overly stressful. They scramble to promote store managers with no experience so the lower position managers have an incredibly hard time since the store managers make calls about stuff they know little to nothing about."
King Soopers,1ct1qbn93aqj0800,4.0,"The most difficult part of my employment with King Soopers was that there was often a sense of having more duties to complete than time allowed. But this is a common characteristic much employment. A definite pro was that management often went out of their way to find a niche for employees: for example, I was often asked to create the Chalk-art signs for the Kiosk, or to set up new promotions. It was nice to be able to apply my creativity in my work. It was also nice that having not been employed by the company intermittently, I was offered an even higher rate upon my return for previous and newly acquired experience. Management was fair and often did the best they could to work around employees' personal commitments, despite seniority scheduling requirements. King Soopers did have a strong sense of family. It may sound like hyperbole, but my longest lasting friendships were formed working for this company, despite working at different locations and even cities. At the same time, perhaps along with the family-feel, there occasionally was a sense of excess drama and oversharing of coworkers' personal lives (gossip). The greatest lesson I learned at this job was to not take things personally, particularly the treatment given by some customers. Along these lines, I also learned to treat every individual following the same personal values I had developed."
King Soopers,1ct1cr82uak7q800,3.0,"It was a popular food market to shop, with a lot of great employees to work with.  The most inspiring element was the company's commitment to high standards & customer experience."
King Soopers,1csvlg30jaqj0800,2.0,If management doesn’t like you then you are done. You will never advance or be promoted. You will be faced with attitude and management who will find a reason to fire you.
King Soopers,1cskeqtekakbd800,3.0,"I got a 15 minute break every two hours (usually) or a 30 minute lunch after 4 hours, and besides those it was just constant bagging for customers.  My favorite part of the job was collecting carts outside, because, though it was physically taxing, it allowed me a break from the monotony and repetition of checking customers out of the store, as well as get a breath of fresh air.  Beyond getting frustrated with that process, though, the work was alright.  My only other complaint was that management required you to find others workers to replace your shifts if you couldn't make them unless you asked for time off two weeks in advance, but beyond that they were fairly accommodating."
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."
King Soopers,1csci9guaas2v800,4.0,Great people and great place to work but you will have to stick it out to prove you are in it for the long haul. Decent advancement when opportunity is available. Union dues are a pain.
King Soopers,1csa941gpakba800,2.0,Long hours expected low pay. No holidays. They offer +1 $ more an hour on holiday pay while other company’s time and a half. They could careless about your personal life they are not flexiable. They’re management is joke
King Soopers,1cs9li3mvakej800,4.0,"King soppers is where i learned my customer service skills, and how to work with others. Sometimes the hardest part was pushing baskets in the snow because they would get stuck or having an angry customer. other than that it was a fun job."

King Soopers,1crer5l58aki4800,3.0,It was nice working with the public but there are times when there isn't enough help. Having lazy teens working during the busiest times isn't good but you learn to get through.

For my Senior Project, it requires a lot of money to do. With this job, I will not be able to work on my project."
King Soopers,1cpuvl4fiakhl800,3.0,Nice steady work you are going to get over forty hours every week.Since it is a union job you have no chance to move up to another position. Fast job staring at machines all day sucking your soul at your body

King Soopers,1cpfsebp4b828800,3.0,King soopers was one of the cleanest places ive ever worked. The management team was fair and expected just as much accountability out of management as they did other employees.
King Soopers,1cpdmrhbdakdf800,2.0,Job had no opportunity to advance . Management had no discernment on employee’ s desires for jod position . Management had no respect for employees . No benifits to generate incentive .
King Soopers,1cpdcvo57as1i800,3.0,The people who worked there were agreeable but some managers always had biases for certain people to work at one specific thing. The working schedule was not particularly accurate and the way the building and people were run didn’t make sense and was very unclear.
King Soopers,1cpd57c2vaka2800,4.0,"Customers get to know you and you build a rappor with them, watch out for the gossiping around the building, watch out for shady co-workers, the weekly pay is awesome"
King Soopers,1cpd566rpas1i800,5.0,"A typical day was walk in punch the clock only 2 min. before your shift begins, you may be required to cashier, pack groceries, courtesy desk attendance.  Ask the Head Clerk where she wants or needs you.  It was fast paced and the time flew by."
King Soopers,1cpckn65cakdf800,2.0,Overall I loved my job at kingsoopers but I didn't care for the lack of training that was provided in order to do my job effectively an not get yelled at for not completing something I was never trained to do. Putting more job responsibilities on one person enough for 3 people and only giving 8 hours to do so. I tried numerous times to get some more training only to be told they don't give out more training. I'd think if they promote you they'd train you thoroughly and or get a fellow worker in management to give proper training.
King Soopers,1cpbjqd83ak68800,3.0,"Y'know, I really love this job but the fact that hours are inconsistent and the pay is minimum wage I can't in good faith recommend this to anyone. I don't recommend being a CC or Clerk for Kings."
King Soopers,1cpa68bdqas1i800,2.0,"Worst company I have ever worked for. Poor management, terrible customer service, lazy staff. And terrible terrible terrible management. Never once got a raise in the time I worked there and had to wait three weeks for my vacation pay on top of them missing my other pay for a week and a half."
King Soopers,1cp0gu74raqhf800,4.0,"I like the folks I work with. I like that I don't get bored and there are always challenges within the store. I am a member of the ""promise Team"" which the goal is to help build a positive work environment for the associates, customers, and vendors."
King Soopers,1corktcvdas1f800,2.0,"This was my first job and even towards the end of it I worked myself to death. But that wasn't because of kings requirement, thats just how I'm wired. Even with this, I was seen as someone who could be used to make them look good. Being one of the harder workers in my department, management doesn't care about that. Just a tip for those who want to work here, do the bare minimum and you'll still have a job. Customers were possibly the worst. Kings has the customer's always right policy but they take it to the absolute extreme. Customers can yell at you for telling them their card is declined and somehow you're wrong. Overall this job is for people who are desperate for a job and will take anything. Not a job I recommend even to desperate people."
King Soopers,1cor1sdnvb865800,3.0,My store was super busy so there was always something to do. Most of the people were great. Some difficult customers but you only got a raise when minimum wage went up.
King Soopers,1cood8l8pakdb800,3.0,"There are many managers, but there was one that used his job as a power source. The others were helpful and understanding."
King Soopers,1comavq3vaqhc800,3.0,"Typical work day would be to open up, input rx that were submitted overnight or early morning, take in orders from the night before, Monday, Wednesday and Friday put away Peyton orders. Answer phones, send and receive faxes, call insurance companies, call and receive calls from customers, problem solve, follow HIPAA, work at the register, put drugs away. Management was passive aggressive. I learned to be a lot more patient and that being kind can get you a long ways but some customers you will never be able to please. It's just the way it is. The customer is ALWAYS right.....yeah they believe that. Even when the customer throws a bucket full of groceries at you and demands you check out their items. Still it would somehow be our fault in managements eyes (not pharmacy manager, store manager)."
King Soopers,1col0rit1ak64800,4.0,The company has done an excellent job implementing clinical practice with pharmacy practice.  The difficult part is having the proper amount of time to perform those activities.  Sometime it takes 40 minutes to complete a comprehensive medical review and the prescriptions and immunizations are all waiting for you as the only pharmacist at times.
King Soopers,1cod5u6n0akda800,4.0,Very relaxed company that didn't hassle you as long as you did your job appropriately. Easy to get along with coworkers and management and great customers

King Soopers,1co7b2utgbrdp800,2.0,"King Soopers and Kroger as a whole was an excellent company to work for about 7 years ago when I started working for them. However, in recent years the company's new CEO and board members are focusing less and less on keeping the employees content. The focus has shifted from an engaging and fun customer service environment to a dysfunctional and mixed up mess of both shiny new and decrepit old technology that takes pride only in its meaningless buzzwords, and a work environment where both the employees and customer service are an afterthought. The company wont give anyone enough hours or pay to conceivably afford place to live that isnt a trailer, and they're so busy trying to do more with less that they can't keep employees from running for the hills at the slightest opportunity."

King Soopers,1cnv4bn3pak5r801,1.0,It's like any retail job. The only thing that matters is making the CEO rich. You are not even a person to them. You don't matter to them at all. You are a number and nothing else. Don't expect to be treated as a person either
King Soopers,1cnun8u9saqh7800,2.0,"I loved all of the employees and most of the management. Moving up was difficult, but it isn't a job that I would want to make a career out of. It was my first real job and I learned a lot."
King Soopers,1cnug9f5uak5r800,2.0,Working at Kings was too bad. The job wasnt too easy or too hard. The customers werent too bad. The only bad thing about the place was management. They thought they could do whatever they wanted and they can make their employies do whatever they said. The management through out the store thought that (at the time i was 16) they could make me close on a school night and that i had no choice but to do it.
King Soopers,1cntd7qiias17800,3.0,"Working for King Soopers was not my most enjoyable job. Most days were slow and in the end, there was nothing else to do. The management never saw eye to eye with any employees, and the employees seemed to lack any kind of passion for their job"
King Soopers,1cns3qqvfas14alv,4.0,"King Soopers was a fairly decent place to work. Environment can be stressful at times depending on your department, people can get along sometimes, other times not so much. Management was fair, some were good, some were bad. Pay is great, hours are inconsistent and all over the place. Overall it's great for a student to work but hours vary depending on employment status."
King Soopers,1cnoket0aaqh1b52,3.0,It's pretty good place to work. Almost everyone is nice and has a strong work ethic. the hardest part is when you try to finish on time and get everything out when you short staffed or when they can't send the stuff you ordered.
King Soopers,1cnna8at7aqh1dq3,5.0,"As a GM employee, I was taking care of everything requested by management in the department. Stocking shelves, managing inventory, and always helping customers with questions. As long as you did what you were told to do in a reasonable amount of time, the job was very easy.

King Soopers,1cnhk6v2vakcsb43,3.0,The location I worked at was union which is different then any other place I worked at. Raises are based on hours worked not on ability to do a good job. They do sonority when scheduling witch means if you are a new hire you will be closing for a while
King Soopers,1cng96f1kakgr86h,3.0,"After working at King Soopers I have such mixed feelings about it. The pay was awful (due to low pay, store dues and union dues), the schedule flexibility was awful, the job positions were boring and the customers quite rude. However I found being a bagger and courtest clerk to be quite relaxing and easy and I ended up working there for about a year and a half."
King Soopers,1cnf4idmcakcsaeo,3.0,"Working at King Soopers is fine. It is a lot of repetitive work. The management was so good when I started but is now horrible. At the service desk, we deal with money transfers, utility payments, paycheck cashing, customer complaints, etc. As a courtesy clerk, we have to do carts, bag groceries, maintenance, cashier work, etc. It is just like any retail job. If they like you, they will work with your schedule, but if they do not like you, they won't."
King Soopers,1cnd8agtiaqgt885,5.0,"A typical day at work consisted of bagging groceries, collecting carts, running the cashier, and providing excellent customer service. I learned how to perform under pressure during big rushes at one of the busiest King Soopers in the country while still providing the best customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job was feeling cared for and respected by my management team and building friendships with my coworkers."
King Soopers,1cn8g3ad15n9gfcf,2.0,"Overall the company car was s more about the amount of money than their people and it shows in how personnel are treated. There are no fixed shifts unless you have been with the company at least 3 years and even then they are not guaranteed. It is a union job at most stores, though there is a lengthy probationary period. The pay has come to be only competitive within the grocery industry."
King Soopers,1cn8522s9ak9c9dg,2.0,"Like other places, it has its ups and downs, but recently its been more down. Most customers expect their stuff to be bagged instantly, and the rushes have all registers open with at least 4 customers in line each. Even around the store, customers complain about how the store isn't ""perfect,"" and cause a fuss when they don't get their way. On the bright side, the lower level coworkers stick together and most try to keep morale up. Management is often never around when you need them, and most of the upper staff is as aloof as the customers. Just about the only enjoyable part of the workday is carts, and even then you have customers that will do anything to make sure you stay under their heel."
King Soopers,1cn7hqsf8akcrd0t,3.0,"Working at King Soopers was really hard when it came to meting the demands of the Associates and the Management, because they had to meat the demands of the customers. I think that if they allowed more options from their seniors staff from day and night then create a better system for the new employees so that way it would not be so hard on them; maybe they would be able to keep more newer employees at the at the king Sooper I worked at."
King Soopers,1cn5caeeras0rabk,3.0,"King Soopers as a whole is a nice company. Customer service is their number one, so they give you the power to make your customer happy which is very nice. It gets extremely busy which can be very overwhelming. Management differs from store to store so the work environment differs from store to store and even department to department."

King Soopers,1cn4qqiklakcraa4,4.0,"I Loved working for kingsoopers, the only problems I had was scedualing in different departments and not letting me know when and where I am sopost to work that day, also written schedules where a big deal, would like my schedule to be in fine print and always right about it. also I do not appreciate them not announcing management positions open so I could apply or ask for that position, the management switch around is stupid especially if that person does not know the department at all. and in my store the click list is going down so fast because in my position I was suppose to do the manager job and do the shopping, also work different departments and when I asked the store manager if I could have the position as manager he told me no and that only a manager from another department that didn't even know click list had to do it? somethings aren't working as a team all together with all departments. And that is something I would like to change. other wise the people and helping my employees and learning new skills in different departments and getting to know everyone in the store and helping customers and getting compliments was the reason I loved going to my job everyday."
King Soopers,1cn0itf1iaqgrbr0,3.0,"The store manager is very rude and sexist toward women. Most of the managers are incompetent and don’t know how to run their crew. Favoritism plays a big role in how managers treat their employees. Stepping up is very difficult, they usually hire out of store unless you’re a butt kisser. The turnover rate is so high here because no one can take all the stress they put us under. The only thing keeping most of the employees here is the pay."
King Soopers,1cmvufkd0aqgrdkq,4.0,the company was pretty good to work for but needs to work on raising its employee moral. It was fun at times but the new CEO made changes that effected the employees.
King Soopers,1cmt57al4akcqbfs,1.0,"Bagging and stocking groceries, the environment is very boring and unprofessional. The customers are very disrespectful as well as the managing team.  During my time spent there, I was a cashier and a bagger. I decided to resign from my position as a courtesy clerk as the position wasn't a good fit for my personal interests."
King Soopers,1cmqk7vraakcq8i8,2.0,"The main thing I received while working at King Soopers was customer service, which I attained purely from working in this kind of environment. In my positions, I had to deal with multiple incompetent workers and they would remain there because it is extremely hard to get fired once you're hired, which leads to laziness and a lack of effort. this places saving grace was a handful of dedicated hard workers which can be found at any place of business, and was usually overlooked due to the amount of poor workers."

This of course meant there would be new mangaers. The new managers are 100% the reason why I quit. They were awful and made the work enviroment terrible.
King Soopers,1clup5tkt1bgc41u,3.0,"Intense pace for managers.   Managing others while being responsible for priority stocking.  Many required daily and weekly tasks.  Repetitive, so very few surprises.  Variables in day were staffing issues, delivery times, and order sizes.  Hardest part of the job was always trying to do more with less.  I enjoyed teaching new associates, interacting and teaching customers about products.  Management was great, they looked at results and if you exceeded expectations they left you to run the department with little interference. Kroger implemented new policies and suddenly micro-management became more commonplace.  Had a great culture and you could tell people cared about each other.  Was welcomed quickly and didn't feel like a new hire for long."

King Soopers,1cl4m0hub1ba122h,3.0,"It was a great place to start as your first job to gather som experience but besides that the advancement can sometimes be a bit stringent as everybody who has been working there, has been there for 20+ years so it's hard to move up or get their hours."
King Soopers,1cl0okann1ba17nu,1.0,"Never enough help, customers complaining/leaving for competitors because of this, they treat their employees like it's their fault they're too short-handed, and it's not very attractive to people looking for a job. Starting pay is horrible, and you don't get many benefits if any at all until after 1 year of working there. The only reason I stayed for a while is because I started when I was in High School and I currently do have good benefits. But because of these issues, nobody wants to work for King Soopers anymore,. Customer Service is NOT their #1 priority. They'll say it is, but it isn't. Their #1 priority is their charts, more specifically, how many people go through self checkout or use Scan Bag Go. We could have a day where we have tons of help working that day, customers satisfied since they don't have to go through self checkout with a big order, and management would freak out because not enough people checkout themselves. Customers constantly ask why we don't have more help. This is why I'm trying to quit and find a new job."
King Soopers,1cksm6jrnak4n9sa,4.0,"King Soopers tries to provide a pleasurable workspace that allows leaders to shine. King soopers will move you up quickly if you demonstrate the ability to perform and the desire to achieve. Unfortunately this show of worth comes at the cost of working exceptionally hard for exceptionally long shifts over an exceptionally long time at exceptionally difficult stores. For me, this meant working 6 day weeks at 60+ hours a week, often breaking a dozen pallets of produce per day(more on the weekend), while 4 workers understaffed, while training 2 new workers, while maintaining paperwork and salesfloor standards in a million dollar store that happens to be in a high-theft area, that happens to have the most foot-traffic in the division. Like most jobs, menial tasks complicate with overwhelming numbers, I would have achieved assistant to the store manager within a year and a half. Pharmacy provides a better work-life balance."
King Soopers,1ckptg82h1aif4rm,2.0,"Benefits and pay are better than anywhere else, however the job environment leaves much to be desired. The job itself is rather easy if it weren't for the fact that management will quickly write one up or scream out employees for overlooking small details or even for something that is the result of a personal disability.  I cannot speak for the other locations but the location I worked at had gotten especially bad."
King Soopers,1ckog4q9i1ahv0vf,1.0,"I worked for King Soopers for a year as my first teenage job. If you are a high school student thinking about working here, STOP. DO NOT. I asked to be off no later than 9;30 0n school nights, and was scheduled until midnight almost everynight. The managers are unprofessional and do not understand what minor laws are. They never once had my schedule match my availability, and i was punished if i was late to work because i was still in class."

I had a college degree, and wasn't expecting to be asked if I would be interested in being a Pharmacy Tech.  King Soopers paid for training and put to me work.  It was a little bit of a sink or swim at first as I work in one of the busiest pharmacies in the company.  They do have learning opportunities online, but we never have time except on breaks to do much.  They do pay for the Pharmacy Technician newsletter which we can access from home.  It's an excellent resource.  They offer good benefits for part timers.  They do try to engage employees in the company and do have tuition reimbursement."

King Soopers,1ck1gdvam1ai36a7,3.0,It was my first job so I have some fond memories. I had a lot different managers when I first started working there. The only manager that stayed was the main store manager. It’s a good job for a high school or college student. Just have to make sure you get the right hours if you’re in school. Stay hydrated during the summers when you do buggies. I’d recommend this job.
King Soopers,1cjthgr4l1ai356c,1.0,"Advancement at this King Soopers was based on time only.  Quality workers were compensated the same as ""slackers.""  The General Manager was prone to temper tantrums and lacked general focus or an ability to motivate."
King Soopers,1cjr9ki871fdj7ac,3.0,"The day is always busy, but that way I learned how to manage my time well as well as take care of any customers needs or wants.  The management leaves something to be desired, as we are consistently changing store assistant managers, as well as changing the company as a whole to be more environment friendly. The hardest part of the job for me was the hours. They weren't consist and caused me some physical distress. On the other hand, the part of my job I most enjoyed was the time I spend with a few coworkers and customers. They always made me smile!"

I usually worked the production shift which included making party trays, sub sandwiches, salads. And I was also responsible for cooking the rotisserie chickens in batches that came out at specific times. The deli was always busy with customers. The hardest part of the job was helping the customers while getting all of my required tasks completed in a timely manner. I enjoyed going to work. I never missed a day (until I got sick) and was never late. I learned to be patient with my co-workers. People learn and work at different paces."

However, the company is notorious for hiring people as ""part time"" employees and yet gives them full time hours, making it so they aren't required to give their employees benefits.  The pharmacy technicians are also paid about the same as a cashier or checker, despite the fact they have much more/harder responsibilities.  The job/work life balance was horrible.  The company didn't try at all to allow their employees to enjoy their lives outside of work.  Ask to get off fifteen minutes early to go to a family dinner?  Don't even think about it!"

We even held ""competitions"", where we were timed on our items per minute, and given prizes for being in the top three. It was a pretty fun and exciting job. Only downside I can think of is, my department manager was friends with fellow cashiers. So he would favorite them over everyone else, and even treat others very poorly. I quit because nobody cared about his behavior and I was tired of the favoritism. It happened with multiple supervisors, he was just the worst one."

King Soopers,1cikj8cfgas0sa6j,3.0,"My Co-workers were nice but I didn't really enjoy the job. It was fast paced sometimes, but I noticed that the cashier's would have to constantly ask me to do an age check for alcohol, cigarettes and other things that needed an ID check for. So, I would have to leave my job in bagging to go do the cashier spot, while most of the time the cashier would just stand there and not help me bag, then go back and bag and be behind in bagging. That is fine to do when it is slow but when there is a line that should not be happening. They should have an age limit on the cashier if that is the case. Also, I was told I would only have to push carts in twice ( you do it for an hour each) and there was times when I was sent out on carts 3-4 times a shift and pushing carts inside, I did that for an hour. So between 3-4 hours of pushing carts is not good on your back. Plus breaks, you got them but you never got the full amount because the time you get back to the break room or back up front, you never get the full 15 min or 30 min break for lunch."

They have done this to me several times. Management is poor. They told me I would go back to days after they hire someone for the graveyard shift, but they scare everyone away because they only offer $10.50 an hour.

Pay scales are fair, although new associates were hired at higher pay rates than many of their contemporaries, including management. Career opportunities are provided but little to no support is offered from store management to pursue these goals. Attended college courses through a program offered by the employer to pursue a store management position. After several semesters of courses, no feedback or support was offered in relation to this career path by store management. Requested a performance review for over a year and never received one. Formed good bonds with team members, and at most times a strong team environment would develop. Overall, a good place to work that could be great if management offered support in advancing one’s career."

King Soopers,1cgo4cl8c1ai84r5,4.0,"I bagged there and it wasn't too bad, fast paced at times, but fairly manageable . Customer service was alright, just was there to get the job done not really to start a conversation."
King Soopers,1cgmnlso11ai801v,3.0,"It's been some time since I worked at King Soopers, so maybe a lot of this is non-applicable, but it was a good, flexible job while I was still in High School. It was consistent, busy work but not such an overload that is negatively impacted my school career either. However, attempting to stick with the company afterwards came to prove difficult."
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."
King Soopers,1cgikk4af1ago4ut,4.0,"King Soopers was a decent place to work at. The only thing annoying was the front end management forcing you to work the fastest because they were too lazy to help. Also some customers were very rude, but other than that it wasn't bad."
King Soopers,1cgfguv051d055is,3.0,"A far as the Delicatessen is concerned the work is hard. As compared to other departments in the store you will stay later, get dirtier, and overall put more in than anyone else."
King Soopers,1cgdle7mf1ah22vk,1.0,1.Since most of their stores are 'Union' they schedule based off of seniority not BUINESS NEEDS.
King Soopers,1cgag5agkak4kbnr,4.0,a typical day at work would be usually pretty busy but it tends to vary. management does a fine job of keeping everything in order but as I get older I seek better opportunities which king soopers cannot provide for me.
King Soopers,1cga3oluqak8keou,4.0,"A pretty good company as far as grocery stores go. Regularly hiring people, especially during the summers and the holiday season, making it a good place for potential part timers and students. Getting hours that work with your outside schedule can be tough, and your shifts can sometimes be wildly varied, but if you hold through and gain enough seniority, it can be a pretty good balance. Work keeps you busy and usually keeps you moving."
King Soopers,1cg3lii0abrcj981,4.0,I enjoyed working with the staff. The discounts we're excellent. The hours were nicely organized most days. Being able to work with others and work alone was interesting and welcomed.
King Soopers,1cg26td8qaqgi8sp,3.0,"Depends on the store and management you work for but as I was an employee there, there were much much easier ways to solve issues and conflicts that weren't thought of beforehand. The management team was ridiculously unqualified for their roles and the untitled employees seemed to be more professional and teamwork motivated to complete jobs as a whole, not individually. I would not recommend my former store, but as a whole King Soopers would be a 6/10 for places to work."
King Soopers,1cg02e53iak8kf3f,2.0,"Working here was the worst. The management was young and didn't care about anyone but themselves and their ""work friends."" I constantly got yelled at for stuff that wasn't my fault."
King Soopers,1cfvu7sphak4k870,4.0,"Worked at the bakery for awhile and it was fun, smelled all the fresh baked goodness. Supervisors were nice and understanding. The deli was just as good."
King Soopers,1cfvntfgtak8ka32,3.0,My boss bringing personal life into work and upper management did nothing me and two other associates left over this going on for 3 months straight. Is still unresolved.
King Soopers,1cfuaefco1ahu22v,5.0,"Getting to talk to people all day long. Standing for the majority of it with 15-30 minute breaks, depending on how long your shift is. Getting carts from the lot to inside."
King Soopers,1cfnrrpug1ba14mu,5.0,"King soopers is a great company overall, but some stores have very poor management, which in turn makes the employees lives more difficult. Overall, it was a good company and I am willing to go back."
King Soopers,1cfj19ddd1ai11b6,1.0,Nothing is ever good enough and the company does not care about their employees. Everyone is replaceable. If you disagree with too management they are out to get you. Harass you until you step down or quit your position. This pressure comes from the DM not the store manager. Getting promoted is all about who you know and how well you are liked. Not about your performance.
King Soopers,1cfg7og4r1ai173c,3.0,The experience of working in a King Soopers is almost entirely dependent on how that location is managed.  Many of the daily activities and tasks are the same store to store. However if the shift and store managers are not assisting their crew these tasks can become a nightmare to accomplish.  If they do support the crew however the job is fairly easy and even enjoyable if you enjoy interacting with a lot of people.
King Soopers,1cfg492el1ba16n6,3.0,"Management made working there way more stressful than typically assumed. My schedule was very inconsistent and changed randomly sometimes without being notified. Generally, it was a very stressful work environment between the customers and management."
King Soopers,1cf8dn5rqas1cfdf,5.0,"It was like working in a big family. There were some issues with communication, as there is in any large company, but everyone looked out for everyone"

King Soopers,1cf6no2thas16f89,4.0,"Surprisingly to me (because of a long history of being at a competitor of King Soopers), I really enjoyed my job.  The people I worked with were fabulous, both in the pharmacy and throughout the store."
King Soopers,1cf5t2mm8ak97bnq,3.0,"Have worked there for almost one year, was promised I could work 20-25 hours per week, have consistently worked up to 38 hrs per week.  Mgmt keeps telling me they need to hire more people before my hours can be cut."
King Soopers,1cf3cobkpaqh6cqd,3.0,The company is only concerned with the bottom line. A few good managers but they are generally forced out but the corporate culture. Organization thinks they know best and will not listen to employees concerning local market.
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."
King Soopers,1cev3i6aoaqh6egi,3.0,Started there as a teen to get some experience on my resume. The store was constantly busy as were the workers. Not many promising positions there. Met a lot of great people.
King Soopers,1ceul6dm0akd4dg1,2.0,"Customers are always in a rush, management  along with co-workers were always angry, and half the time work was stressful. There was to much work politics."
King Soopers,1ceukid8vas16ak8,3.0,Management in my store was great and most employees themselves were friendly and helpful. The hardest part was the physical labor of lifting ~40-50lbs items from bottoms of cart and the best was probably seeing customers who were regulars and friendly.
King Soopers,1ceqccpa0ak94e6n,3.0,"Learned a lot about customer service and union work. Enjoyed that every day was a unique experience because you deal with different customer issues each day. Did not like the fact that advancement/bonuses are based on how long you have been with the company and not on your work ethic and merits, very discouraging if you are a hard worker."
King Soopers,1cep1qcdnak52ctu,4.0,"Early start at 12a.m. and fast paced from clock in to clock out. Great group of people to work with and very supportive team environment. I did miss getting more customer interaction as my shift ended two hours after the store opened, but enjoyed assisting the few customers I would get to help out."
King Soopers,1ceonjg31aqh3bar,2.0,"It's very fast paced which is nice because the day goes by fast but it's very disorganized.  You're told to do whatever your immediate superior assigns you to do but then your manager's superior keeps changing things, including your schedule, even though they have no idea of your training or your availability.  It makes it a difficult place to work at due to this."
King Soopers,1cemd3b00ak4vf54,2.0,"Fast pace workplace where you are on your feet all day and are in constant contact with the customers, it is attempting to be a positive workplace, but it is in constant fights with the high turnover rate. The management pushes all its work on the workers and asks them to take on more tasks than they can complete in the day, then get angry that not everything was completed perfectly. Constant write ups for things that do not warrant write ups and the superiority can just take your days off without your permission, and will call you in whenever they want and you can not stop it."
King Soopers,1cekgfom6akgscup,3.0,"Management wasn't that great and seemed to come from all walks of life. It was a union job that made the job secure but made it hard to get any weekends off for any reason reguardless of your needs. You work nights, weekends and holidays. The people who have been there the longest are also some of the worst people to work with. They get weekends and holidays off because of seniority but also were some of the laziest people I have ever met. No training and its definitely a sink or swim culture. Learned how the grocery industry works with no training.  Plenty of work though with raises every 6 months working 40+ hours a week. The health insurance is some of the most affordible in the U.S. No matching 401K because you pay into a pension."
King Soopers,1cek3qkeeas10dob,4.0,My coworkers were great to work with and I had a lot of fun. For the most part it was laid back. The customers I dealt with on a daily basis could be very frustrating and eventually the job became exhausting spending almost nine hours a day in the store.
King Soopers,1ced789r4b855d7j,3.0,King Soopers is a pretty decent workplace. No benefits or paid vacation. But the managers seemed to be understanding when I was sick or otherwise couldn't work and I always got the days off that I requested. Managers were good at hopping on a register when we were busy rather than pulling people from other departments.
King Soopers,1cecsbp1aakgsfaj,2.0,Worked here for a few years when i went to college. About what youd expect from retail. Working in the deli you got to sample all the food though which was nice. Saved some money on food expenses.
King Soopers,1cecq2kpib8558re,3.0,King Soopers is part of the Kroger Company. Kroger has many stores throughout the United States. This makes transferring in or out of state much easier should a person need to relocate and want to stay in their current job.
King Soopers,1cealoqgmak4va4i,3.0,"Only major issue is the lack of understanding for associate availability times. More often than not you'll be scheduled to work on a day you've told them well in advance you can't work. It can be rectified by switching hours with another associate, just annoying they don't seem to care what days you can and can't work."
King Soopers,1cea5ito6brcu8og,4.0,"It was not the perfect fit for me, however it was reliable and I could count on getting in a busy workday. With this position it is constant moving and stimulation. I also enjoyed the 10% off my purchase's."
King Soopers,1cea4kqpbaqgv881,1.0,the most boring job i ever worked. felt like that days lasted forever. i was going to school and working. they would schedule me later then they were supposed to. sometimes their written schedule would be different then their online.
King Soopers,1ce4tp6gqak4ocns,4.0,"A typical day at work, consisted of nearly 10 hours and a non stop, urgent mentality. However, this job taught me How to develop a strong work ethic, sense of urgency and opened up doors to potential, yet undesired career opportunities. The management varied. Some were phenomenal and others were below average, to say the least. The workplace culture was fast paced, cut throat and never ending. You needed to be able to complete tasks quickly and efficiently. The hardest part of the job, for me, was the inconsistency of hours, but that's retail. The most enjoyable part of the job was the sense of Independence."
King Soopers,1ce4ee2m2brcmdm7,3.0,Typical 8 hour day and if stuff gets done you get bored for the rest of the day. You learn a lot about the retail life especially on busy days like weekends and holidays. Management can sometimes be consistent and sometimes inconsistent. You get along with most employees and can even become good friends. Everyone is nice. Hardest part of the job is to be able to get stuff done in 8 hours as they don't allow overtime and especially when it gets busy and you have to stop what you are doing and help at the front end. The most enjoyable part of the job is feeling accomplished after a long day.
King Soopers,1ce2v44rb5n8p9j2,5.0,*Superb management
King Soopers,1cdp3ctkl5n8p9e4,4.0,The Pharmacy was a fun place to work and King Soopers provides excellent benefits. It was hard to move into a full time position and still wasn’t full time after 6 years employment.
King Soopers,1cdoichkaak4obp0,4.0,"Apply for departments you actually want to work in. Some departments are better than others. Less recommended are night crew and deli. The work is hard, the shifts aren’t optimal and the starting pay isn’t great."
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."
King Soopers,1cdkn2l6f1ahe71c,1.0,They don't care how hard you work or how well you do anymore. It's only about if they like you or not. Typical work days are just anyone being bothered by management.
King Soopers,1cdi6l0oo1agu25p,3.0,"Solid, decent paying job that is not very difficult. Inept management and corporate blindness are only things I didn't like about it. Other than that, I enjoyed helping people have a great experience shopping at our store."
King Soopers,1cdfhucuh1ahe7pq,5.0,Did basic front end responsibilities. Helped out other places that were short and helped customers out when needed and gave a good experience for them
King Soopers,1cde2l5lf1aht7kl,1.0,"You are just a number to these people and they don't care about their employees well being despite relentlessly claiming they really care. The only way you can actually survive with this company is by working full time. But you'd still need a second job. As for the management, it's a revolving door."
King Soopers,1cd8e0cf90mtf67l,5.0,"restocked shelves, moved old to front, kept inventory of stock replaced."
King Soopers,1cd6q47hm1aid6th,5.0,Enjoyed my experience working at King Soopers.  Wonderful coworkers and management..  Worked in a much smaller and older store. Due to this I was able to really connect with the guests who shopped at this location.  Benefits and compensation were incredible.Receiving raises every six months was very encouraging to continue my employment with King Soopers.  What was a frustrating is the equipment we were provided is extremely dated and quite often needed to be repaired causing a shortage of equipment to prevent all departments to complete the required work load in a timely manner.
King Soopers,1cd3393cg1bgb0g4,2.0,I have had some issues with king soopers. They are a union based company which is nice but at the same time it’s terrible. I hated paying the union dues because it was extra money that I could have used. The union has fought for people that should not be working at king soopers because of there work ethic. In my experience especially at my store..they will hire anybody they can get. They are always really desperate for employees and it sucks for the rest of us who are trying to excel in our job careers but we are constantly held back by the other people they hire who have no work ethic.
King Soopers,1ccu1liteb816ajl,1.0,"After working for a year and half the worst thing about the job was the amount of work with such little help. There is no work life balance even though they say they do, and don't follow their core values."
King Soopers,1ccpvm52dbrd3cgs,2.0,"All the workers were great and had amazing attitudes towards their work, no drama or gossip. Head clerks were respectful and worked with the courtesy clerks with the best of their ablilities. Management struggled with scheduling and often refused to work with people on their availability given at hire, very under staffed, and employees were never given proper training. Courtesy clerks were often used as  custodians/janitors, but never paid additional wage that was promised for working the position. Large turn-over, not properly trained. Employees would be assigned to train new employees themselves, even if they had only been working their a month."
King Soopers,1ccn0qi50ak8re1b,4.0,"It was a lot of fun to be able to have a job where I felt confident. Although, the Head clerks were extremely rude and disrespectful to all employees."
King Soopers,1cch7i0n8akgpcjo,3.0,"There is never a dull day in the deli keeps me busy always going i like that. I slice meat,hot bar,cold case i cook chicken i prepare the food. I serve the customers. Fulfill orders. I love working with my co workers great invroment"
King Soopers,1cccdoregakcp8rc,5.0,"A typical day at work included keeping the meat counters and shelves full, keeping  the cases dishes and counters clean, providing samples for customers during the day, keeping customers happy, and keeping within the standards of the health department."
King Soopers,1cc6pg2ssbrd3cpl,1.0,Management does not care about their workers. New changes or programs happening almost weekly. No work life balance. Management consistently talks down to employees.
King Soopers,1cbtgr8ccas0pc20,5.0,"King Soopers was an incredible first job. It was easy to move up, plus the offer tons of benefits. It is a very good company to work for while in school."
King Soopers,1cbpvddjsas0mesu,3.0,"They hire more people than the department needs so they can cover shifts when people call off, which I understand, but most people that start there get 20-28 hours per week. The union takes 22 dollars a week out of my check so realistically you're making minimum wage unless you've been there 5+ years. They don't pay based on performance, only on how long you've been working there if you're in a union store. And you don't get benefits or vacation pay until you've been there for a year."
King Soopers,1cbkfcs6jak4mffu,1.0,I did not enjoy working at Kings Soopers. The lack of leadership and poor Compensation led me to leaving the company.
King Soopers,1cbflu7g1ak8m9o5,4.0,"I joined king soopers as a cashier, I applied for a grocery clerk but they didn't have any positions for that role despite the application saying so. So they offered the Cashier and I was intending to work part time but ended up working over 40 hours a week and even when told I was suppose to be part time I was told 'we are working everyone for 40 hours because we are under staffed.' The store is packed from 9 am to at least 9 pm every day with few and short breaks. The only saving grace was some of my coworkers at the job."
King Soopers,1cbfa9ie5ak8mbsh,5.0,This is the place to work if you want to converse with many different types of people.  Working in the general merchandise department I got my exercise everyday and I enjoyed that immensely.
King Soopers,1cbf2t2b2ak8mcf1,3.0,"Fast paced, learned fast, took on extra work loads and job skills, chef, and cold case setting, learned and could run every aspect of the department, my skills and knowledge strengthened me as a employee, always finished my work load and task, learned new skills, and aspects of assistant manager, manager, confident with my achievements and accomplishments. learning new things, customer friendliness and friendships."

King Soopers,1cbab3hheak4k90a,3.0,Typical day starts a 3 am. Hardest part of the job is waking up that early. The work culture allows for many types of ethics and sometimes that creates a less than desirable working conditions.
King Soopers,1cb6ksrlmakcheov,4.0,"The typical day would stare by getting to work several minuets early. As soon as I got to work I would find one to the assistant managers and see if they had any special instructions for me. If they did not I would start my shift. This could be either working the counter, frying food or helping at the hot bar. I did not learn a great deal at this job since I had worked deli before. Management was very empathetic and helpful. This job was very team oriented and I had very friendly co-workers. The worst part about this job was the occasional angry or unfriendly customer. This is bound to happen with highly customer oriented jobs. The most enjoyable part of this job would have to be my co-workers. Although I was only there several months I grew to be quite fond of my fellow employees."
King Soopers,1cb5g6d8uas0j9nk,4.0,"Being a barista completely shattered my understanding of coffee and taught me the importance of a customers preference. It's almost like an art form to deliver to satisfied comers, especially if they acknowledge the patience and care you put into their drink. It's a real confidence booster. When came to management, I knew their hands were full with trying to run a brand new redone store. There was a lack of communication with not only my department, but neighboring perishables as well and it created a road block in the store meeting it's standards. For the most part my hours were great, but we had so many on deck bodies dropping left and right to where i'd have to take more hours. I'm not the one to complain for more hours, it really just started affecting my school work. I want to see the store and each one of their staff to succeed."
King Soopers,1cb59t45vas0j9mj,5.0,Working at king soopers was rewarding in that it was like family.  They were flexible and showed concern for family/ personal issues.  It was fast paced and there was sooo much room for advancement.  They really cared about each employee and tried to provide help if needed.  They were excited to promote you if you were interested in other positions and worked with you too make it happen.
King Soopers,1cb302ih3akghasn,4.0,The people you work with are amazing. The big bosses tend to pick the most inconvenient times to tell you what to do. Lot of standing but as long as you keep busy you don't notice it as much.
King Soopers,1cb0vooltas0j8i4,1.0,I worked there for 8 years and barely got a promotion. I worked my butt off and nothing. Was told I wasn't impressive to them and complained all the time when someone needed time off for like a family thing or an emergency or if you were too sick to work.
King Soopers,1catpu5jaak4j968,3.0,"KingSoopers is like most large corporations in that their rules and policies were to be followed.  There were approximately 200 people employed at store #127 (Belmar Commons-Lakewood) and it ran on fixed procedures.  The store manager set the tune for the store and the managers changed every couple of years, some were good and others not so good.  I worked in the dairy and was not subject to constant supervision.  Hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks with dairy loads, extremely heavy.  After transfer out of dairy worked as day clerk for the store with replenishment, handling customers, etc.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with some really fine people,  Most are still friends and I enjoy seeing them when in the store."
King Soopers,1caqn4gke5n8kfql,3.0,it was an ok place to work  i did not like the hours i worked and it was hard because i worked in the gm department and we woukd have to breke down the loads

King Soopers,1cagahtru1ahi0jp,3.0,"I personally did not work for this company to long. Management turnover rate was high in the store I was employed at. Benefits were not great, I was not there long enough to receive them. I did enjoy working for the GM part of the company."
King Soopers,1cacf826a1ai37ns,4.0,"The King Soopers I worked at had very nice employees. They were talkative and welcoming in a wonderful way. I however did have some slight issues with upper management. I don't feel they always handled thing to the best of their ability, and there was a lot of bias."
King Soopers,1cabuaq3f1ai34bu,1.0,The management is awful and its a complete buddy system.  They will team up and falsely accuse employees with a false witness.  I wouldn't recommend buying anything from them much less working for them.
King Soopers,1cabhgc4qak91at5,4.0,"The time I've spent at King Soopers has been pleasant. I get along with everyone I work with and management is good at working around personal schedules and events. They are very understanding. While the environment can be fast paced, it's not too stressful due to the team dynamic in the company."
King Soopers,1ca94fgfeb84od9j,1.0,"Working at King Soopers from my experience, is frustrating.  Your availability is completely disregarded and you will consistently get scheduled times you can't work if there are any.  Communication between management seems to be lacking, so that few issues actually get dealt with.  Courtesy clerks and new employees are definitely treated with less respect than other employees.  The schedule comes out on Friday for the upcoming week, so if there are any scheduling conflicts it is extremely difficult to deal with on such short notice.  Your schedule can change without notice or approval.  Breaks are usually not on time, or forgotten completely."
King Soopers,1c9rvkehtaqjvdpv,5.0,"I worked for King Soopers for seven to eight years. A typical day was pretty smooth. I learned a substantial amount about food safety and production.  I had some trying experiences when I went into management. I was an assistant manager in the deli for a short period. I felt the store management was unapproachable and at times abusive, especially towards department management and assistants. There was really nothing to difficult about the job. Getting to know customers was the most enjoyable part about working for Kings. I genuinely enjoy making people happy."
King Soopers,1c9q2ujj31fdn5ua,4.0,I worked there for 3 years and honestly it was a steady paycheck and the people that i worked with i got along with great for the most part. There is somewhat of a support system but it depends on if you ask for the help or not.
King Soopers,1c9idmmvd1agp4oa,4.0,King Soopers is okay to work for if you're a teenager in high school and if you're looking to start college but I wouldn't make it a career.

King Soopers,1c9ibg3jtakfpfmg,5.0,"The pace and business I find enjoyable mostly. It's not for everyone, and the team and co-workers make it work. The company is a decent company to work for. Every location has a different vibe, some are better than others."

King Soopers,1c8tlkbjc5nbuaon,4.0,Tasks are very simple and easy to learn. Management depends on store and location.The hardest part of the job is finding the time and motivation to get everything needed done. Most enjoyable part would be being recognized by management for doing well.

King Soopers,1c8k0sj2makjge95,1.0,"I worked for them for 3 years, when I first started management was really helpful and supportive but then they switched out managers a few times and they seemed to just get worse and more controlling."
King Soopers,1c8j3r2h0akjgep5,3.0,"Good place to work for students and kids. Depending on what department you work in and the people you work with can have a big impact on how you view the company.  You may be told that your applying for a checker, but come in and end up on the nigh crew schedule your first week because its too hard to attract people to work that shift. Even though it good for students, be prepared to battle for your class days off if it changes from what you told them in the interview."
King Soopers,1c8iman1pakjg939,5.0,Very fast paced and always something to do. I learned a lot about the deli and customer service. There was never a dull moment at work. The people I worked with helped make my days go well.

King Soopers,1c88q6osiaqjg957,3.0,"My brief time at King Soopers was enjoyable but was also overwhelming at the time. This was the first job i had held and was only looking to work part-time. Due to a shortage of staff though, i was scheduled to work 40 hour weeks from 1:30pm to  10pm. This was more than i expected or desired at the time. I was also unable to get my schedule altered in any significant way, which was a contributing factor to my search for a new job."
King Soopers,1c88kb0j9ak7pf57,1.0,i think it amazing place good money its just place your not going be happy working for in long run. I think everybody should be happy where they work not stressed.

I worked nights during the week and on the weekend I worked early hours. I loved working in the bakery, Management and my teammates were the best. I learned bookkeeping, scheduling, and making the bakery look its best."
King Soopers,1c83sca245j7bbea,4.0,"It was either busy or not, not to much in between, everyday there was cleaning, greeting customers, and helping with assistance, things you would imagine to happen at a job. Wasn't to stressful in the free time employees would talk and have a good time while cleaning or doing some little things around the front."
King Soopers,1c81oado6ak7ocss,4.0,"Fun place to work, many opportunities for work in all departments with many different hours offered. Great advancement opportunities. Low stress, good, hard work. Management needs improvements."
King Soopers,1c7tr3u7gakbv8qf,3.0,"At one point, I actually enjoyed my job. I got along with all my coworkers for the most part. The only thing wss that I was making table scraps. Then management got moved around and I started having problems. Next thing I knew, my manager was trying to get me in trouble. Months later I had to quit over a lie. If you work here, dont expect a promotion unless you want you kiss the managements butt."

King Soopers,1c7jpkhdv52vic0o,5.0,"Providing customer service to the general public internal , external managers were always to teach you different areas in the store to gain eye sight on the store values. Being the for customers with questions and assistance needs"
King Soopers,1c7hei2u8akj6f1u,1.0,They are a typical corporate chain with no regard for overall safety or well-being of their employees. All about the numbers. They cut hours regularly and expect more work to be done with less help.
King Soopers,1c7eqj8tcb87kel5,3.0,Working as a team isn’t the best with king Soopers but the overall r job isn’t too bad. Just do your job and do the best you can to keep up. My advice at this job is take a deep breath and don’t think to far in to the job
King Soopers,1c7dcbns05nbc8pg,3.0,"It was a fairly decent job to have, Co workers werent hostile, the higher ups genuinely cared about the employees, though the positional managers did occasionally have glaring issues that were hard to ignore."
King Soopers,1c7and2voakf28af,2.0,The store was doing just fine when I first started. Managers with experience kept the place going and felt fine. The guaranteed 20 hours a week was nice. After a year getting a week of paid time off was a great plus as well. Things went downhill though when they started moving store managers to different stores and filling in there spots with new hires. They didn't have experience with how Kroger ran and when faced with a question they could almost never come up with an answer on their own and need to consult someone else. With no managers in the store that has experience there was no one to teach the new hire managers on what to do. The store got to a point where they had to send back people to teach the new managers. In the end it end up hurting the store with too many managers who didn't have a solid understanding of everything and it hurt the upper management.
King Soopers,1c7a35i0vak7celp,3.0,Did over night baking which was always fun. Got off work early and when not baking i did mid shift. And got to help out at different store when needed
King Soopers,1c7a1njc0akf2cr5,3.0,"Each shift has different responsibilities. Late shifts are changing adds, facing up lobby, stocking wet rack proficiently, unloading truck, breaking down load, and cleaning back room. First day is welcoming but not structured. Training is when something is done wrong otherwise learning over months span different details of the job. Night crew in produce were hardworking and driven. Produce manager was very kind and understanding and informative."
King Soopers,1c74k1rt5akbi8oe,5.0,"This was very easy job . I watered plants in a greenhouse most of the day and it was very chill. The manager was really nice. It was a really easy job that paid about what the work was worth , which wasn't much. I liked it because I got to spend a  lot of time alone and outside with plants. There was lots of opportunity for creative expression through the bouquet arrangements."
King Soopers,1c74js5q2akf2c1h,3.0,"I worked really hard at this job and I really didn't like it. It s not a hard job , but its  just really gross because you have to be touching raw meat all the time and you get splashed with blood and grease. It just wasn't for me but I made lots of friends there ."
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."
King Soopers,1c74fkg5kakf29jf,4.0,"I can go on length about the failing of this company, but that would be disingenuous. I learned a lot in my time with this company, and would return if I do leave. The biggest problems i see are the lack of training in the location I'm at, as well as the slow response to it's competitors, though the later may be due to union intervention. I have had some of the worst managers I can even think of in my life here, as well as some that were so great i still aspire to be as good as them."
King Soopers,1c74efchj5j71967,3.0,It was a good place to work and good paced and a good job to start at . The environment was fast paced always working but made the job go by fast so didn’t mind atall ! Over all good place

King Soopers,1c6shuj8makbg813,4.0,Working at kings you have to be able to work at a fast pace in teams and by yourself for long hours. It is a fun job but cuts into your life plans. enjoyed the experience.
King Soopers,1c6lu9t35aqj2dpv,3.0,"I worked at King Soopers for about a month before my fiancé, who worked at the same King Soopers, passed away. At first, I was not given bereavement until I came in twice to tell them it was necessary. I was placed on an LOA, then let go without notice due to said LOA."
King Soopers,1c6j8iojcak76ase,1.0,"King Soopers makes it sound like it would be a great job, and every one is super nice to you for the first day or two. But after you have been there more than a week they treat you like garbage and they are completely disrespectful."
King Soopers,1c6dtrobkakerdle,1.0,"No room for advancement, they play favorites, if you do get the chance to move up- you'll be moved to a new store every few months. Terrible pay, managers don't do anything but berate and harass you about store conditions you can't control."
King Soopers,1c6b9mp3bak6nbcg,4.0,"It's not great, its not terrible. Its a good job to have until you find what you're looking for. The immediate managers are nice but often over worked. The company is trying to hard to be an 'upscale Walmart'. They don't let you put any personal input really to improve the company. They just want to stream line everything. Only way to really move up is to become a manager, and nobody wants the positions cause they get poorly trained and over worked. Have fun getting the days off you want/need even if it's a putzy minor holiday."
King Soopers,1c687n1fjakei9he,4.0,I really enjoyed working for King Soopers. At my store I felt that they were fairly flexible with my schedule. Managers were driven to train their people in their teams and set goals. I liked that I felt I could improve but not felt talked down to.
King Soopers,1c65qotdfakifbgo,3.0,its just like any other grocery store but customer service is what brings people back. always have a smile on ya face and you will be fine. good work environment
King Soopers,1c62r7qfeak6nepe,4.0,"As fun and as challenging as it was, I never really felt that I belonged in the Deli Department. The management was awesome but my gut feeling told me to transfer over to Meat and Seafood because the managers over in that department were more challenging (in a good way) to work with. Their expectations were always high and I really wanted to challenge myself. Deli was challenging but I didn't feel as pushed by the managers"
King Soopers,1c61jph4raqii86e,4.0,It was a massive thing to see how everything made customers enjoy our new products and having to try them as we needed to. It made me realize that working in a small place actually had benefits that I never knew beforehand
King Soopers,1c60u2okpaqiif8e,4.0,"I worked at 4 am every day, so my day started early. I learned nothing. Management was't bad. The hardest part of the job were the people. The most enjoyable was always having something to do."

King Soopers,1c5r9a3v7akifa5e,4.0,Working at King Soopers was a lot of fun but came with a lot of work to do throughout that day. Had to be quick with customers but also work with them in a timely manner. Management could have been a little stronger in certain areas but some how made things work.
King Soopers,1c5lu0pbnaki7882,2.0,not fun at all because of the environment and there has been unsafe activities happening there and i dont reccomend working there because of their past history
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."
King Soopers,1c5hi6qi0ake2967,5.0,Working for King Soopers yielded many friends of whom I am still in contact with. The other employees made me feel more than welcomed and like I was accepted in the workplace. One of the main reasons I am no longer employed there is due to the fact I learned I wasn't the best at dealing with complaints with minimal emotions.
King Soopers,1c5efqnuhaki5fcr,2.0,"managers were to busy to offer training or advice, no team work, always point blame, no upper level support, not enough sanitation, not enough help, high turnover, compensation needs to reviewed"
King Soopers,1c5ctto63aqi6e0m,5.0,"worked for them for 4 and a half years, its good for the above average health insurance. Around $8:50 gets taken off automatically with your weekly check when you sign up for their health care."

King Soopers,1c5a0n3mcak6c9fm,1.0,Most disgusting job I've ever had. I had to clean the restrooms and the entire store ever hour or two. and dump every departments trash as well as help the front should they be short staffed or should it be busy.
King Soopers,1c59k8kgcake287o,4.0,As a night baker I had the benefits of working full time and getting a night premium of almost $3 on top of my existing pay rate. Management was friendly and easy to get along with. The most difficult part of the job was working the holidays as that is when most departments are super busy. The most enjoyable part of the job is that it was all fairly easy.
King Soopers,1c59bpea8aki5d2v,4.0,"I enjoyed connecting with my customers on a daily basis, providing them with a beverage they know is made just the way they want it. As a lead, I learned time management, budgeting, ordering and its many hardships; overall, I learned how to connect with not only customers as I'm the first person they will come to with a question, but with my team as well, as everyone has a different learning style and needs different ways of approaching them."
King Soopers,1c59041a1ak6cdh3,4.0,I had an issue with the store manager when my niece was born. She almost fired me because I was going to be an hour late since my niece was born and i was the only family my brother had at the hospital that morning. She has since been let go.
King Soopers,1c57i2efeaki3cak,3.0,"The everyday atmosphere wasn't so bad but there were many stressful days due to upper management. Every other employee for the most part were kind and awesome to talk to. However, store management can come off rude and overbearing. There are a couple of individuals that have been blatantly rude and condescending many times while working there. The main thing that pushed me to find another job is that I was told at the beginning that they would work around my school schedule. But recently was told that they refused to work with my schedule and would be forced to transfer to the front end as a bagger."
King Soopers,1c54jde9qaki18go,2.0,"As a manager of a department, several years ago, when I first started,  we were encouraged to run our departments as we saw fit, we were trusted and taught how to be business minded and were reviewed and praised on our performance."
King Soopers,1c544np0qak67dbl,1.0,"Poor management, poor corporate, poor environment, poor benefits for low ranking staff members, poorly staffed, insufficient wages, little to no incentive for part time employees"
King Soopers,1c53tvabqaka8b2u,4.0,"Fast-paced environment, Have been learning a lot of medical terminology, Pharmacists I work with are mostly great. The pay is super low. Would like to learn new things in hospital background."
King Soopers,1c4vtbt54ak5tema,1.0,"I worked there for 8 years. And once I hit 8 years it wasn't so bad. They say they will work with your schedule. That is a lie. They schedule based of seniority. So when you start off you don't get to choose your shifts or your days off. They give you the left overs. With being a union it means they keep all the bad workers around because they can't fire them easily. So the bad workers pile on seniority and have control of the schedule. Wasn't fair. I would work harder, faster and give better results than my co workers and yet I had to beg and plead to get days off I needed for my son. I almost didn't get to have his first birthday off. You don't get any insurance or vacation days or sick days until you have been there a year. And the insurance is only medical. You have to wait 3 years before you can get dental and eyes. And you get one week vacation after a year. And then you get an addition vacation week at 3 years. And the one more additional week at 5 year. You can never really use your sick days. You have to be sick 3-4 days in a row, and get a doctor's note before you can use them. I was under the impression you could use some of the hours if you had to call in sick. Management sucks the most. They put unrealistic standard on everyone at the store and if you don't meat it they yell at you and treat you very poorly. Management will back stab you every chance they can get. It seems like they just enjoy making their employees life the worst they can. I seriously wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. This company is taking a nose dive and everyone working there should get"
King Soopers,1c4tf001rak5tavj,1.0,"This job is miserable, and literally bad for your health. Don't take a job at a grocery store unless you have to, and try to make it as temporary as possible. Thank you, and goodbye."
King Soopers,1c4svfea7b89vbdn,4.0,A typical day at work would usually be very busy. I learned good customer service working there. The management is good. The hardest part of the job is how busy and stressful it can get. And sometimes people can be mean and rude. The most enjoyable part of the job for me are the people I work with.
King Soopers,1c4okmma0akhodjj,4.0,Great people and a nice environment it can be very fast paced and you have to be able to keep up but other than that its a great place to work especially for a first job!
King Soopers,1c4nskihhakdla9u,3.0,"When I worked for King Soopers during the 1980's and 90's, it had a more supportive work environment and better wages and benefits than found today. But while employed for this company I enjoyed part/ time scheduling flexibility with a wage/ benefit package that allowed me to support my living and educational expenses. I began as a courtesy clerk for under a year, followed by a promotion on the night re-stock crew for 12 years and concluding as a cashier for 5 years. I thank King Soopers for their role in where I am today."

King Soopers,1c4i0u6lcakdl96c,4.0,"I worked at King Soopers for almost a year, and during that time, they told me that working is more important than education.

King Soopers,1c4aglbrpak5ndtj,1.0,the job was fun and they gave employees lots of freedom to help customers in anyway. But for the time i was working there they paid cashiers and baggers different wages and as a cashier i was paid a baggers wage. after many countless times talking with HR this issues never got fixed. floor managers would make you go on your lunch break a couple hours late if the front was busy. often times missing a lunch. when i went to talk to the store manager about these issues. he had no idea this has been going on. they really take advantage of employees in highschool.
King Soopers,1c48a0davakdgetm,5.0,"Every day at work was a blessing, the customers were very kind. Every holiday we celebrated with food and drink, and were able to leave at a reasonable time."
King Soopers,1c47rl71dak9rbpg,1.0,They reason I left them was because I was part of a 1st time processes that they wanted to try. They said that if I didn't want to stay in it I could just be placed in a store near me and would just do what i learned at that store. When they told me that they would be moving where I was working and I told them I could not they just stop talking to me and would not call me back or pick up the phone. In the end since they never told me what store I would be placed at they just left me out of it and I was not able to work for them anymore.
King Soopers,1c47odvkvak9rd25,3.0,Days can be Monotonous but are usually fast paced. There is always something to learn. Management is usually competent. The non management workers are generally great people. Hardest part is the heavy lifting.  The best part was that I pretty much had the run of the department because of my experience.
King Soopers,1c45d2vtuak9r8ee,3.0,Too many young and not trained people in management. Only kind of good thing about the company is the union. Under staffed at almost every location. Inconsiderate managers

This was a great job for someone who loves people, the energy of the fast pace, and being able to create delicious desserts.  This was one of my favorite jobs. The Kroger Company is a fabulous company to work for.  They donate so much to the local communities.  That inspires me to work even harder for them.  They do a great job of caring for the employees.

I have learned a lot over the years about the importance of team work and communication. Management at King Soopers was insistent that we follow these 2 rules and develop them into skills. Our team at the Starbucks Kiosk was a well oiled machine.
King Soopers,1c3cv099tak9ecl2,1.0,Bad management with inconsistent hours and little to no scheduling flexibility. Late hours/early mornings and no benefits for part-time workers. Won't be considered full-time unless you are working exactly 40 hours a week.
King Soopers,1c3b8qh8eaqh2du4,2.0,Working at KS was fun at first. People were nice but the hours get to you. Working weekends and nights with a random day off here and there gets old. Some days its a 5 hour shift others an 8. Some days its a midmorning while you closed the night before... Just not fun when you are married and like to travel. Nice no brain jobs but hours are not friendly toward evening/weekend life.
King Soopers,1c38vk6u1akcsb0o,4.0,"I honestly didn't have a problem with the management team, most of them were always focused on the job and their team. Although moving up in King Soopers was a bit more challenging than other places I worked,but overall I think it is a good place to work."
King Soopers,1c36fg3n35n8q8tu,5.0,worked too many days straight without a day off. I liked the position and I am a hard worker but he schedule was to difficult to keep up with as far as scheduling
King Soopers,1c31v2or0akcsb9k,2.0,Reliable job good rule that management has to follow with union the bad think is low pay rate and no 401K or PTO. Easy to transfer to another store if you don like the one you work at.
King Soopers,1c31cqgbiak95esk,4.0,"A simple job, King Soopers is the best place to start. I recommend the position to students and anyone looking to get into retail. The management is solid, I always received breaks on time. The hardest part about the job is trying to help multiple customers at the same time or having to call a manager to assist you when it is busy."
King Soopers,1c2te4ecdak50a6u,2.0,"I was still in high school upon being hired, and they refused to work with me and my school hours. They had me working until 11pm every single day, and I just couldn't balance the two, and was forced to quit so I could keep my grades up. Now that I'm out of school, though, I'm sure it would be fine."
King Soopers,1c2sr3nm6b853e8j,1.0,Was fired for taking a week off when my son was born. I had permission a month before taking it and when I went back on scheduled day I was told I never requested it and was ambushed by 5 managers insulting my work behavior even though I never heard about it before that. They want kids that don't have an opinion and don't need money beyond buying some fast food or makeup.
King Soopers,1c2rphbmf5ncqcpe,3.0,"This type of job is fast paced, and they see so many people come in and out. Because they have such a high rate of people coming in and leaving they don't give much attention to new employees or care about your work ethic."
King Soopers,1c2pmlmbhas0v81d,4.0,This a good and safe work environment for high school and college kids. Its always a good thing to stay on task especially on holidays and when football is going on.
King Soopers,1c2ep1f2gak50d58,2.0,I enjoyed working with the customers and being active through out the day. i also worked with some really great people who were  great to work with...
King Soopers,1c2d6oterak92cto,3.0,"typical for a retail setting, medium to heavy workload, hours vary depending on site, cut-throat upper management, unclear conveyance of rules and regulations but with out of proportion consequences;"
King Soopers,1c2d2u3t1as0vch2,3.0,"If you are OK with whatever is given to you, you can have a 40 hour work week or less. Be prepared for hard work on your body and lots of time on your feet."
King Soopers,1c2css3lkb850bdm,2.0,"In the last couple of  years the company no longer values there associate.  A lot of people are leaving the company, as well associate turnover is higher then ever now"
King Soopers,1c2cc01daak50a3a,5.0,I was proud to work at King-Supers.  They gave me a clean environment to work in and a safe place to earn money.  I liked most of the supervisors.  (No ones Perfect)  I earned a decent wage.
King Soopers,1c211pfv8ak4u97h,3.0,Hired on as a courtesy clerk. Cashier did not deem appealing with all the bending over. I am shocked on the worn out vest's and cheap strap they use for getting the carts at least at my store.Embarrassing to say the least. Not even a decent coat rack for us. We have to double up our coats over other workers.Billionaire dollar company?Day two a manager got mouthy with me. I let it go. I am retired anyways and  just doing this gig for something to do. I plan on three months in the front end then I will transfer to maybe produce. Decent coworkers I like just about all of them. I don't recommend this job as a career if you have a lot of bills and family. I like the fact that even the store manager will bag groceries when the stuff hit's the fan.Give it a shot if single and no family to worry about.
King Soopers,1c1tcv2olak90bi6,4.0,"No front load belts for the regular registers means bending, constantly, into and out of the cart, which puts a lot of strain on the back for those over 6 ft tall."
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."
King Soopers,1c1okhhgkas0lfk4,3.0,"Not bad. I didn't intend to make a career out of my stay but it is entirely possible to do so. However management does play favorites when it comes to job promotions according to my observations and first hand accounts from coworkers pursuing management positions. Expectations coming from the top are always enforced rather than tried and true sensible and efficient practices. With that being said: If you're looking for steady work with competitive pay and benefits, King Soopers just might be right for you."
King Soopers,1c1obrlt3b84lbd7,4.0,I enjoyed interacting with the customers and working with my coworkers. Loved learning new things that I had there.Enjoyed the fast pace I was expected in scanning products and helping customers find what they were looking for.
King Soopers,1c1mj0vbraqgkdjt,5.0,"I really enjoy working at King Soopers, they are very positive with good communication. There are rarely any rough days and if there are we help each other out. There is little to no drama and we all get along really well."
King Soopers,1c1ldolotaqgkc23,4.0,"It is what it is, a busy grocery store. The hours are all over the place. Overall it's decent if it's the environment you want to be in. Just smile, help customers and get through your day."
King Soopers,1c1dps527b84ld22,3.0,There's always a lot to do. I got the chance to work with a lot of nice people. The job is really repetitive though and the turn over rate is rather high.
King Soopers,1c1ab49htak4k8td,3.0,"Its common knowledge when you work for this company that what they feel towards their employees has been going down hill for 20 years since Kroger bought it. The new management style of ""no human factor"" is pushing people who were dedicated to their careers out the door. They are expecting employees to give them full availability but only want to give 20 - 30 hours at very poor pay rates, impossible to make a living off. I myself have worked hard for 3 years in a job that has many management duties and after 3 raises only make .30 more than new hires. Its frustrating seeing the fellow employees, which by far is the best part of working here, so stressed all the time."
King Soopers,1c19uriidaqgkemv,1.0,On my 2nd-day brand new to the company I did not feel safe when an older pervert bald courtesy clerk with a beer belly and I was alone in the break room sitting next to him on the wear and tear couch close to the coffee table kept touching my right thigh and going underneath my king Soopers medium blue shirt to feel my breast.
King Soopers,1c15psv8m1bac7um,4.0,"As a teenage worker I quite enjoyed working here. The coworkers were like family to me and the environment was fairly safe and clean. I am a high schooler, and as such need some schedule shifts to accommodate for homework and school activities, but they were very hesitantly given or never given at all. Lots of physical labor for courtesy clerks, and very busy/stressful during certain parts of the day. No raises for courtesy clerks/teeagers. Might try working in a department other than front end once of age."
King Soopers,1c13smhu71d157lg,3.0,"The original position that I applied for was cashier but i was told that those positions were already filled up so I decided to become a courtesy clerk. However, during my time there I noticed that they hired not one but two people for the cashier position even though I was told it was unavailable. Furthermore they really didn't train me that much during my first week there and one of the head clerks didn't bother to help me with the carts. That same head clerk was just pretty bossy and nitpicky over everything when it didn't look a certain way and would constantly watch over me which made it uncomfortable for me to actually enjoy the job. Another thing was that the carts were pretty heavy to move and they often only had one courtesy clerk out there so it was difficult to bring loads of them in all the time and it caused my body to be in constant pain. Even when I asked for help the head clerk would sometimes have an attitude and just tell me that I was wasting my time. Though I enjoyed getting paid weekly the job just wasn't worth it. If I have to deal with being in pain and rude head clerks than getting 20 cents more than minimum wage isn't worth it."
King Soopers,1c10jqf0r1ah332u,2.0,"Lack of training, most employees were non complacent and cliquish ordering new employees around to do their work! I was alarmed over lack of Sanitation and Cleanliness at this location! Complete lack of communication amongst manager to employee."
King Soopers,1c0ujc4pras22a9a,3.0,There was not very much organization. to many people telling you to do different things. The hours where going down because of being over staffed when there was not enough staff.
King Soopers,1c0rpg8paas22dbd,5.0,"Good company to work for, very competitive benefits for retail industry. Not a bad place to work if you like overtime, can be stressful at times during the holidays."
King Soopers,1c0pk9mrjak5vc8g,3.0,It was my first job I was 16 and for my first job it was really good. Definitely something that can be a career just not the path I chose to take. But all and all a good job.
King Soopers,1c0pk1c2lbrdnfaj,3.0,King soopers is a good place to work and they treat their employees fairly. I would gladly work for tis company again in the future and would recommend you consider working there as well.
King Soopers,1c0pf74hbak9v9ln,3.0,"The last manager I had to work under forced me to stay over my schedule time, if not I was told I would be written up or fired. At the time I was using the bus for transportation and had asked not to receive the over night shifts due to lack of transportation, the next printed schedule I had two weeks of overnights, luckily my co-workers made the days seem quick."
King Soopers,1c0n227kqas21ean,3.0,"I always have enjoyed the customers and associates I have worked around. There are many different kinds of people whom you can learn from and are willing to mentor/teach, which, I have been on both sides of the situation. I have met and made a lot of friends over my years with the company and am greatful for the job opportunities I have had."
King Soopers,1c0n05hjaas21a5h,4.0,"It's retail. Same stressful, money oriented issues as all retail pharmacies. More work required with less help. More duties with less help. Otherwise, the company is supportive of pharmacist discretion with filling prescriptions."
King Soopers,1c0kvnjj5b85ubb5,1.0,management needs help or choose different ways to approach different scenarios . The hardest part of the job was trying to follow what management wanted and also what your supervisor wanted.
King Soopers,1c0k9tvcsbrdb8q2,4.0,"King Soopers is a great way to get your foot in the door of the work environment at a young age but you once you get around 17-18 years old it is probably best to search for a job you would like to stick with for an extended period of time, King Soopers doesn't provide much advancement nor enough pay for bills around 18."
King Soopers,1c0hm96o2akdjbrl,3.0,"High amount of products that needed to be packaged and labeled everyday. Different types of bread and brand names must be memorized and labeled properly. My bakery manager was always helpful and patient with me, which made my day at work less stressful."
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."
King Soopers,1c0hfssf3ak9ke3q,5.0,I really like this job and unfortunately got terminated due to a co worker stealing something and me happening to be walking next to him to the break room when I never even saw this happen. However they had me on camera paying for my  stuff so it was a guilt by association ordeal which I understood :/
King Soopers,1c0hc7ghlakhc8s2,3.0,"This was my first ever job and have seen so many changes and can say that it wasn't for the better. As a cashier, the front end management is mostly made up of under qualified employees that get the job because all the senior employees don't want to put up with the BS from upper management."
King Soopers,1c0ep7gi7aqhffac,1.0,"Run, don't walk, if you're even considering employment here. Employees are treated unfairly and harshly in front of the general public and one manager even made the news for emails threatening violence with a gun to employees."
King Soopers,1c09ge0o5akdcfvr,4.0,Long days very productive .
King Soopers,1c07ambjjb85hfla,3.0,Fast paced unlimited opportunities for the hard working. Great store to learn all the subtle daily jobs within a grocery store. Customers are always right and their needs come first.
King Soopers,1c05b12inb85adq9,4.0,Everyone starts out part time unless your in management.
King Soopers,1c02kd6p4ak5c9dq,3.0,"Management is hit or miss. On Monday they'll tell you speed is more important than accuracy, and on Tuesday they'll tell you accuracy is more important than speed. Apply here if you want to do the jobs of 3 other people then get yelled at for not working fast enough. No room for advancement and the pay is poor."
King Soopers,1bvqm8cl9b80pcjo,2.0,"Great atmosphere to learn many areas of retail.  Entry level experience and cross-training is available in all departments.  The business is fast paced.  There are many opportunities to move up into management, but upper-management can be extremely stressful."
King Soopers,1bvqbvk5tak548vt,2.0,"we were understaffed and required to push past our scheduled hours, sometimes going 4 to 6 hours over. management also regularly ignored doctors notes requesting certain things at work, and would sooner let you go then listen to the doctors notes."
King Soopers,1bvd9s2meas0sbug,3.0,I enjoyed my time working at King Soopers.
King Soopers,1bvcda23e1d0b3m5,1.0,"I have applied for a job, I wanted to stock the shelves overnight. But I was sent to the shelves just to face items on the shelves. I have been waiting for a chance of an opportunity for A YEAR AND A MONTH! I never got an opportunity and I have not grown into my job. It is a joke. I am very disappointed in managers. No one cared about my training. I had to teach myself to get to know the aisles. Unfortunately, I have learned NOTHING from the managers. My advice is if you are deaf, don't apply for a job at King! I am considering to work at the school as a janitorial in 2018. Wish me a Good Luck!"
King Soopers,1bvau2dp4akgodtk,3.0,I have worked for this company for 7 years i recently transferred from a non union to a union and have treated so differently this meaning with more disrespect than ever!  I used to love doing what I do and now I just cringe everything I walk into work
King Soopers,1bv7sdnapaqgqdrh,3.0,many other people are less socially awkward than me so they were able to fit in better. I was teased by coworkers. Management was always great though. Overall a valuable experience but not one I'd like to repeat.
King Soopers,1bv5ovijdas0scdl,3.0,"The company Kroger provides many opportunities, benefits, and steady raises as long as you put in hours....IF they allow you to have those hours. It does not matter how hard/honest/capable you are willing to work, ""Senior"" employees can bump you from hours/vacation/and shifts. All of my assassinate manager and shift leads were great but the main manager was very unprofessional towards employees. I personally left with no issues but sad to see other treated poorly."
King Soopers,1bv5jjepbaqgq9lh,1.0,"For the past year, the company has experienced an employee shortage. In the past couple of months, it has become the standard policy of the upper management to treat the hard working employees who have stuck around like garbage and to treat the new hires (when we get them) like gold even if they don't show up on time, or decided to call in 3 days out of the week, frequently. Someone had a no call/no show for 7 days and were still allowed to continue to work there.The rest of the people, who show up everyday, have to pick up the slack, and direct management are not given the tools or back up they need to keep discipline and any complaints are shoved aside. As long as the store can somehow scape by to meet the bare minimum of company sales standards all safety and workplace cooperation are ignored. This true of most store in the district."
King Soopers,1bv3nbkheakgoaf1,3.0,"It was very cold to work in temperature controlled environment. I learned how to work under pressure on a assembly line when packing meat, the enjoyable part was working with staff and the employees."
King Soopers,1bv3hdl7pak8q9mn,2.0,"The employees here are just people that don't really care about advancing in life. They all talk badly about each other, and are never in a good mood."
King Soopers,1bv3d6vtlak4rbis,3.0,King Soopers is a good place to start out when you are young.
King Soopers,1buototrp1fdh7p4,5.0,Schedule is different week to week. Great union pricing for health insurance and discounts for food and helps lower the price on your gas bill. Great company poicies.

King Soopers,1bujee0ju1d0i2l5,5.0,Overall Kroger needs an Overhaul  of some of its stores that are non Union especially in Colorado and to competitive for hours and if management likes you u can excel fast The little person always loses
King Soopers,1bueag81gas159ku,3.0,learned lots about mgmt. of a fast paced environment. have had some great mentors and leaders that have guided me in the right direction and to happiness.
King Soopers,1buc339q11d1e7ah,4.0,"As far as customer service/retail jobs go, King Soopers provides great benefits and many opportunities to grow within the company. Although it can be a demanding job, you are compensated nicely and provided the support you need to succeed and advance."
King Soopers,1bu7r4tmcak93c53,4.0,"at work, i would check in and then i would either work as a bagger or a checker. sometimes there would be meeting to attend and i went to those. i got along fine with my coworkers and management was a little strict but not unfair or mean. the hardest part of the job was pushing carts when it was raining or snowing. i did get sick once from having wet feet after pushing carts in the snow, but it was kind of my fault for not wearing shoes that weren't canvas. the part i enjoyed the most was working with people. i loved working with people and talking to everyone there."
King Soopers,1bu7ota38ak50bcg,5.0,"Clock in, start bagging customers groceries. When head clerks ask to  go bring in grocery carts, we would do it."
King Soopers,1bu4gvi9cb80mb9g,4.0,"I learned how to work with upset customers and how to make it right. It is fast paced and their are a lot of things to do like pay bills, restock, western union, and money orders."
King Soopers,1bu27p91h5j76ak6,3.0,"My typical day at work was, clock in, report to head clerk, start greeting customers, checking them out., making sure they found everything ok. take breaks or lunch, finish my shift and go home."
King Soopers,1bu1kj3a8akct9pr,4.0,Kings is a great first job for anyone and the staff or soon to be co workers are friendly and kind. The job isn't bad but can be stressing at times. Overall good place to work.
King Soopers,1btv2rgbaak509sp,3.0,Only thing I have to say is working a person full time on a part time status does not feel right to myself. A typical day at work was cashiering. Management was very poor and need to change how they take care of work related issues. The hardest part of the job was getting hit by a car when collection shopping carts but King Soopers did cover medical bills under compensation insurance. Most enjoyable part of job was the people I met and seeding those I already know.
King Soopers,1btmcdtus1d0b7ds,5.0,Prepare to get thrown to the wolves once in their employment.  They hardly don't train you.  They use their new employees every which way they can.  They only care about their corporate selves!
King Soopers,1btk92ldmakcnaf2,4.0,"The job was very stressfull and things had to be done a very certain way and if you messed up you also got talked to or written up, we all make mistakes. people dred going to work everyday cause management wasn't so great."
King Soopers,1btk7bth6akgoeg6,1.0,This was the single most unpleasant experience I have ever had. Not enough people to work and Kings wont hire. Please if you like life and things don't start here.
King Soopers,1btfpuuibaqgp8ar,2.0,I was brought into King Soopers on the 5th of October and started working in the deli. They started me off doing online training courses and eventually brought me out ito the deli. I was then taught in a very fast manner how to treat customers and how to use the slicers. The deli manager wasnt very fond of me and disliked me for some reason while I worked there. He would always make me do these tasks that I havent been trained in and he told me to do them anyways. I left King Soopers because the management was poor and they threatened to fire me because of a time card mishap.
King Soopers,1btf1trq2as0qd8j,2.0,They push you and push you to be faster. there is never enough help. no training. no job advancement. constant turn over in employees. Manager was more interested in the young boys working there than training or helping good employees. Not a chance at advancement. you must know someone to be someone
King Soopers,1btacl3dgakckfnm,3.0,"It's a grocery store. I was more comfortable, relaxed and accepted at the Arizona location (Fry's). I informed management that I had allergies to seafood yet they still assigned me to work Meat & Seafood dept. telling me to just ""wash my hands"" and hurry up."
King Soopers,1bt7l48jbak8me1u,4.0,"Better than other competitor companies for salary and benefits. Provides more support staff, better hours and holidays, and provides lunch / dinner breaks"
King Soopers,1bt215l771agq0ij,4.0,"King Soopers offered options for advancement up to a point--which was exactly where a person is deemed ""irreplaceable"", at which point advancement stops where said person is."
King Soopers,1bsuqkntt5nena54,4.0,It was fast paced almost all of the time.There is much work that needs to be accomplished daily.The management team was pretty good.The hardest park of my job was being short staffed on a busy day.I enjoy working with new people and I also enjoy learning new thing.
King Soopers,1bsts80v21bg71jp,5.0,"I personally loved working with King Soopers. It's a great place for a teens first job, or a stepping stone for more experienced folks. Nearly every employee and manager I interacted with was extremely pleasant, helpful and enjoyable to work with. A typical day varies on business depending on the day of the week. My store manager was wonderful, very friendly and kind. The hardest part is probably just dealing with difficult customers, but the most enjoyable part was simply connecting with coworkers and consistent customers."
King Soopers,1bsp7k5r0aqgic9m,4.0,"A typical workday can be stressful but still pleasant. I've learned to stay calm and handle situations accordingly. Everyday is different, but everyone I work with is great! The people and personal experiences I have with customers makes my job that much more enjoyable. The hardest part is to meet certain standards. However, we strive to meet those goals daily and with a little effort and teamwork, the job is done successfully."
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."

King Soopers,1bslst3r8as3ad5b,1.0,"A typical day at work is slow and repetitive. Management is always missing from the front and rarely helps out the employees. Upper Management tends to try to insert and wave their authority often. The hardest part of the job is working way too hard for the company and not getting compensation for it. Hard work does not pay off in the environment, and it does not get recognized. Management treats their employees like they are expendable."
King Soopers,1bskjeb76akbgf0c,3.0,"I loved the people that worked there, they were very helpful. When I need advice that I couldn’t get from my family I would turn to my job. And they help me with the situation"
King Soopers,1bshe2pnl5nefcm9,4.0,"I learned all aspects of working in a large Deli, experienced a friendly, fast paced working environment. Upper management was very involved in daily functions and provided an excellent shopping experience. Was very team orientated, willing to help each other out as needed,"
King Soopers,1bsc7s9ojaqirbui,4.0,"The job is okay (front end customer service), but not allowed to advance. Need full time hours. Even filling out proper paperwork doesn't make a difference. Unlike many other jobs,  KingSoopers is unionized so there's a little more job security. Pay is not competitive. For example, Good Times burger joint and Walmart pay $11/hr, while Kings pays less."
King Soopers,1bsbiekn6akaudmv,3.0,"When I worked here, I started off as a courtesy clerk. 3 weeks later they promoted me to a cashier. After that I never got an opportunity to move up.Overall I really enjoyed working at kings and would go back if I had to. Bu If I had to I would make it clear the hours I had available to work. At the time of my employment I lived in a different city and bussed to and from. Which was fine until they moved my shift to 3:30pm to Midnight. I voiced my concerns because there was no buses running at midnight but they had not listened which caused me to leave. Becauses that I really enjoyed working there. I wouldn't complain about anything else. Everyday was about the same as the day before. I would recommend this job to someone who likes things to be predictable with their job."
King Soopers,1bsbdm0r0akauf65,5.0,was not thrilled with the scheduling. some weeks you work all lates on other weeks you worked early and then some weekes you worked early and late in the same week.

King Soopers,1bs93s9guakau9vm,4.0,"Any job within King Soopers is fast paced and extremely customer oriented. The most enjoyable part of the job is how fellow employees try to help one another as much as possible. The downside of working for King Soopers is that while schedules are based off seniority, the longer you are there the more you get to select the shifts that are desirable for you, they have a difficult time retaining people. The retention issue often causes King Soopers to be short staffed and over work the employees that remain."
King Soopers,1bs6tjfshb8b4crp,4.0,If you are a manager you are payed well. They expect a lot out of you and don't always give you the support to do it. the associates do not get compensated as well as managers

Lots of room for advancement within the company along with lots of opportunity to learn from members of management."
King Soopers,1bs0nhe6sakao89r,2.0,Management at king soopers wasn’t very good. I went back to work there with them knowing I was pregnant and had a heart condition and they said it was fine. Now they fired me because I’m to difficult to work with when I never called out. I made every shift and finished every shift. I threw up one time and had one heart problem. I got told I was a problem from a manager and that he never got sick so I shouldn’t either.

King Soopers,1brk9cr79ak6iben,2.0,"Typical work days are long, I haven't really learned much. Hours are hard to change if you need to change them for something unavoidable. Management is good and the people are good too."
King Soopers,1brhgmfj9akal87u,3.0,"Customers are great, but we always seem to be working shorthanded. very high turnover rate, which requires the employees that stay on to pick up the slack. I work with some good people that make working harder more bearable."
King Soopers,1brf4u5afas2ico1,4.0,very fast paced work place. Mainly friendly customer and associates. Great produce and meat depts. great quality and always fresh. The store is well maintained and clean.
King Soopers,1brd7kdivakahde7,1.0,"no, I would never reccomend anyone to work here. It was an awful place to be and I would come home crying and depressed or high up with anixiety and i rather just be working fast food then kings.."

King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."
King Soopers,1br83apa1aki1fnh,3.0,I don't plan to leave just keeping options open for better opportunities. King Soopers is a good company to work for and many other great qualities. I would suggest family and friends to work here.
King Soopers,1br7vkvccak6e8rk,1.0,Seemed like it would be a good place to work if the management wasn't awful. Like most places - the management is awful. Make sure you have a good idea of the manager before going in.
King Soopers,1br2h21ddaqi4c7b,3.0,"Training at the beginning of the job was thorough and welcoming. My immediate supervisors were spectacular. They were incredibly patient, gave opportunities for creativity and allowed room for mistakes."
King Soopers,1br2dc8t8aka6bk5,4.0,"Really was a great job for 22 years. Although in store pays very little they have a three tier pay scale depending on years of service so someone just starting out will never make what someone who has been there for 25 years. The bakery plant is not that way a person starting today, will after 2 years make the same money."
King Soopers,1br0195acbreffvu,5.0,This company would be better if there were more room for growth and more than minimum wage to start out. Like most corporate jobs there are many rules to follow but overall it was a decent job.
King Soopers,1bqsil9i9akhpbch,5.0,Great place to work and shop. I loved my job at my first store. I got a offer for full time but had to relocate. Sadly my store manager and deli manager who's names I will not say were awful. As is made the the store a very stressed environment. Caused a lot of employees to walk out of a well paying carrier. I would go back to the company if given the chance.
King Soopers,1bqs0k8m5aka6afl,4.0,The shift was pretty stressful and people in other departments treated bakery as if it wasn't important. Other then that it truly wasn't a bad place to work. And I'm sure it just varies from store to store.
King Soopers,1bqovp1b852tuafo,5.0,Good workplace comraderie. Somewhat overbearing management. Hardest part of the job- the people. Most enjoyable part of the job- the coworkers. Typical minimum wage environment.
King Soopers,1bqoi4p0bak64fjt,3.0,The co-workers I am with are kind and generous and showed the most respect to customers and the head clerks that are present at the time. A few of the managers were unpleasant to work with because a few of them needed to be taught by workers that worked for them on how to perform the task at hand.
King Soopers,1bqmkcr78ak64dmc,3.0,"King soopers was an excellent place to work for. Regular raises, friendly employees, overall a great work environment. However, the bad management started tearing the store apart and many quit, or left to work at a new store."
King Soopers,1bqieu2q8akdt9rk,4.0,"If you want a company to grow with, King Soopers is a decent place to work. It can be demanding, but you can advance rather quickly with the company. A lot of good people work for the company, and if you are a student, they have flexible hours to meet your needs."
King Soopers,1bqid8mu0as279cb,5.0,"King Soopers is a wonderful place to work.  I loved the floral department, as I was able to use my creative abilities, interact with my customers and use my skills to increase sales."
King Soopers,1bq9imiqhb8acb2p,4.0,I would get to work at 7 in the morning and check my section and see what needed to be stocked as well as rearranged and or clean and after that I would speak with my supervisor to see if there's anything specific that I needed to attend to that day and take care of that accordingly then it was maintaining the sections of non-food products throughout the day and helping guests with whatever they might need and at the end of my shift I would pick up hours cashiering
King Soopers,1bpmghut1akdi9f5,4.0,"It was a fun place to work, but very very fast-paced and they always keep you on your toes. There's always something that needs to be done, no time to stand around. Which is what I loved about this job."
King Soopers,1bpk0hdrlakdia2d,5.0,"The workplace is nice, the co-workers are amazing, and the customers are friendly. The only thing that makes this workplace unfortunate is the lack of communication as well as the lack of control."
King Soopers,1bovrrpeuas1geuu,3.0,Not told why I was let go but lots of nothing happened while I worked. It was nice but low experience manger and not actually given what I was supposed to know
King Soopers,1bofq962vakcqcs2,3.0,"King soopers benefitting was not the best for me because, at the time I wasn't motivated enough to have my positions switched fluently while the short period of time I was there. my position was switched three times while I was there. Once was a night stocker for the first week, then moved to the day time but only with the diary and proteins, and lastly in the deli. Which kind of made feel like I wasn't good enough. Later I decided to stop going to work and plus I felt that the employees thought I was awkward because of how quiet I was but I also was responsive coming to conversation."
King Soopers,1bob3l95sas0sa1d,5.0,"During my time at King Soopers I gained a huge amount of work experience from customer service, food prep, stocking, palate jack certification, fuel center service, and cashiering."
King Soopers,1bo86a17gb89593n,3.0,too fast passed for me. I was not able to handle the work load that was required for the job. I tried a few different positions with out any luck so I decided it was not a good fit for me.

King Soopers,1bnm0kebo1bgb0ut,3.0,The hardest part of this job was dealing with upset customers. This is a grocery store job so you have to deal with all kinds of people. Understand that this is a retail job and that you're going to run into all different kinds of people and you have to be able to keep your cool when you get the customer that isn't having the best day.
King Soopers,1bmva7o7faqgrbrc,5.0,KingSoopers Safeway was a easy punch in  get your job done and puch out -go home kind of  job.  Great job  if you like to work hard and keep busy. They have changed their benefits and rate of pay to less than what I was making when I left there many years ago.
King Soopers,1bmv0md4kak568n5,4.0,I got this job while I was still in high school and it was great experience. I worked in the apparel department organizing and keeping the department clean as well as helping the customers.
King Soopers,1bmupj92rak56e55,5.0,"They were there for you no matter what,  I felt like they really took care of me,  and if I had any problems be it personal or proffesional they were willing to listen"
King Soopers,1bmsn4d5b5n92fis,4.0,"I enjoyed my time at King's, starting as a bagger and working to a promotion to the dairy department. Lots of hard work, stocking and facing many products. Customers were great and loyal shoppers, had a good experience overall."
King Soopers,1bmlb77dfak52f7i,5.0,"It's a great environment to become a part of, especially if you're looking for a job that will help you increase you customer service. Everyday is always a fresh new start, and you will always have kind employees to help you stand back up if you were to ever feel like quitting. Retail can knock on your head a few times, but if you have those certain employees to keep you going, King Soopers is the right place to work at."
King Soopers,1bmjim6lab811afa,2.0,"I worked there for 9 months, the first two of which weren't half bad, mostly because one of my two managers at the time didn't involve herself with me and left me to the devices of the other manager. However when I was required to work with her more she began treating myself and many other of those working under her poorly. Incessant name calling and would belittle her subordinates in front of the rest of the crew."
King Soopers,1bmd0eq9dak8p9fr,5.0,City Market management was invested in their employees. They had regular training to keep employees updated on the best practices. You were allowed to move to other possessions with in the company. The company provided fair wages and health insurance.
King Soopers,1bm06dcmob84o9mg,1.0,This particular store has employees that are allowed to work
King Soopers,1blt2omuvakckagt,1.0,Management does not listen. They do not take into consideration their employees when making decisions. No advancement or moving up options. Higher management expects lower works to do management work with out the pay.
King Soopers,1blmj5k1h1ba13ka,3.0,"I've worked for King Sooper's and the parent company Kroger for just over a year, and it certainly has its ups and downs. At Kroger, I was very quickly given responsibility that, as a new hire, I should not really have had. I hired into Grocery, and once management saw that I was a competent worker, I soon learned how to write orders for an entire department, and frequently covered opening shifts for some department managers, particularly Dairy and Frozen. As a part time associate, I worked like this for about 11 months before I moved from Michigan to Colorado. After the move, I took a spot at King Soopers in Produce. This store does seem to be better staffed, so I have not yet placed department orders, although I have placed smaller ones. Overall my hours are chaotic, and hard to plan around. I would expect that unless you are working as a cashier or bagger, you will be scheduled at least 40 hours per week, based on both my experience and my coworkers'. The work itself is not difficult, occasionally heavy lifting or dragging large stacks, although store management can be a little too ""hands on"" at times, telling you to stop what you're doing at the moment to do what they think should be done right now. What can you say besides ""Okay""?"
King Soopers,1blmgp93abrcna8r,3.0,"I got to talk to all sorts of people, and I got to work with really cool people. I actually didn't mind it at all. I do wish that they offered discounts on more than just the kroger brand. It's not very good..."
King Soopers,1blget0k4akggbi9,3.0,Ever since I began working for King Scoopers there was never enough staff to get the job done without overtime. It feels like we are set up for failure by not having enough employees because the expectation of getting the job 100% done on time is strictly enforced even when we only have half a crew. Department manager is stressful for most and the pay is only about 50 cents per hour more than assistant manager.
King Soopers,1blc24o321d184ls,3.0,"The environment was great, and most the people I worked with were great. Connecting with regular customers was also nice. Seeing friendly faces Ann's customer interacting was the best part."
King Soopers,1bl954j4ras1j94v,4.0,"I started with king soopers as a second job which quickly turned into my first job with the advancements in positions. They don't pay their workers a fair wage for what they expect everyday. However, i love going to work and working with my co-workers."
King Soopers,1bl39b0r6aqhs8nj,5.0,I like the job not a bad starter job the pay is okay and the staff is great you meet new people and see new faces every day which makes me happy a lot of stuff to do to keep busy very very clean work area and of course meeting the managers is a plus everybody's fun and likes to have fun
King Soopers,1bl2cq1lrak64fvp,5.0,King Soopers is very organized and have fine tuned all operations of their store. They support you and will invest in their Managers of the future. To bad the Union is nothing more then a prop but overall if you're going to work in retail management King soopers is the place to work !
King Soopers,1bkslcdboaqhoasr,4.0,They are cooperate and friendly. They focus on Customer for the positive environments. Overall good place to start a job. Sallary is reasonable. Close to my home which makes easier for me.
King Soopers,1bkpgno7faqhfdaa,3.0,Its hard to keep up sometimes due to the Dishes we get with customers and being highly understaffed but its an alright job overall but not a job I intend to stay at forever.
King Soopers,1bkjuagiuaqhfa67,3.0,King Soopers pharmacy has long hours and late shift hours. This doesn't give you time to spend with family. The pharmacy has changed a lot they are understaffed for the amount of prescriptions that are done daily. Which can lead to a stressful work environment. If you are not a certified technician it is a good place to start and them move on. King Soopers will get you the experience you need.
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."

King Soopers,1bkat7qo8as0mftg,5.0,Each day I'm in charge of taking in and filling prescriptions for patients in a timely manner. Must have pharmacy knowledge as well as customer service background. The management is very reliable and respectful. The hardest part of the day is getting out prescriptions in a timely manner around rush hour. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and keeping a smile on their face as well as yours. You get to know your customers.
King Soopers,1bjp5od9fak95ffp,2.0,If you ever ask for Day Off you never get cause they always play with seniority. You are better off calling in sick and it sucks. Poor management team. Headclerks are always hard to find when you need them. They are always playing around. To be honest I feel like I'm back in high school. They don't value your hard work at all. I never got proper training.
King Soopers,1bjomg04kaqh6dmc,4.0,"It depends on where you work, or what department. Most departments seemed to have good management and a great idea of customer satisfaction. Manager usually looked out for the employees and did what they could to provide for them. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and the service you helped provided."
King Soopers,1bjnr1ss91bgf41l,1.0,Pay union dues every weeks and they do nothing for you.
King Soopers,1bjlfg2hiak5bdqo,4.0,"Amazing job, sliced meat and cheese for local neighborhood, helped stock shelves, fried chicken, made sandwiches and prepared salads and sides. everyone was willing to help one another, even between departments. Most enjoyable part was making the sandwiches for the people and the deli threw cookouts and barbecues to promote our ribs in the summer. Majority of management had worked there since high school and liked to start drama and talk behind peoples backs, which wasn't so fun."
King Soopers,1bjha56ckakd09hs,2.0,"Its a company that will suck you in for years and years. A fine experience for high schoolers, but get out while you can if you're any older than that."
King Soopers,1bj8sqjh51bg9778,3.0,Most enjoyable part of the job is working with people. Very stressful atmosphere with too many processes and procedures and not enough training to feel successful.
King Soopers,1bj5qrhi7ak8o9ru,1.0,"never enough help, always cutting hours and expecting  you to work at zero error rate. not held as a professional at all. does have union but have not seen the union doing anything."
King Soopers,1bii2ihidb82hatf,4.0,We work lots of hours with very little compensation a not enough people to get the job done right. They have lost lots of people in the last few months and still expect the same amount of work to get done.
King Soopers,1bicnkf5aaqgleco,5.0,Would unload trucks every night made sure all products are faced forward into the edge made sure that everything was stalked and if we needed more stuff we had it on the boats and we would stock it if we had extras we would put it back on the boat and put it in the back
King Soopers,1bi5fhsvnak4mep9,4.0,"Because of a few combining factors they are severely understaffed in all departments. Management is friendly, minimal drama if you stay out of the existing drama. Staff is pretty stressed from the under staffing, which causes a domino effect of poor training and more stress from long timers having to pick up slack. They're also trying to expand to quickly, which thins out the amount of experienced workers at each store.  They need to raise their start wage to entice better workers to apply, but you get raises quickly enough if you'll tough it out a year.  It doesn't take long till they allow you to go into management if that interests you.  As a whole I enjoy working there though despite the issues, since the staff and in store management are very friendly and compensation fair."
King Soopers,1bi25gkqiaqgjfcu,1.0,This job was one of the worse jobs. The hours were terrible and the management was not a great environment that I wanted to be in. The team that I worked with always complained.
King Soopers,1bi1narteaqgjbu5,4.0,"King Soopers is a good place to  work for. It allows for balanced life, has good benefits, and allows a person to advance their career with the company."
King Soopers,1bi01b5i8akcibtk,4.0,"King Soopers was a great first job the only thing was I felt it was hard to change to different departments which made it hard to want to stay. Honestly, it was not a bad job."
King Soopers,1bhv4qa0vak4k9dj,4.0,I enjoyed going to work everyday providing the fastest checkout experience for every customer possible. Everyday I interacted with customers and ensured that they had bought everything they needed. I worked to satisfy customers in the front end of the store.
King Soopers,1bhna17pt1ba3029,5.0,learn morehere then a lot of places fair management fair company very family orientedandwould love to be back there maybe one day I can great team members
King Soopers,1bhdj70tdak9r98m,3.0,"This is a great place to work if you're looking for an inbetween job or a temporary position. There is opportunity for advancement, but the compensation is horrendous. You likely will have people under you who are making more than you, and the seniority based schedule is broken. If you're at the bottom you are guaranteed to work nights, weekends, and holidays. Management and hr need some serious work. The friendship between the two create an untrustworthy environment. The associates are amazing and friendly. However, if you're in a management position you can forget about being able to have any relationship of any sort with anyone without threat of your ability to fulfill your duties. The company treats you well enough, and the benefits are decent. It has its pros and cons."
King Soopers,1bguc47nlaqhdajg,3.0,I enjoy working at grocery stores but the bigger chain stores don't pay much but ask a lot of employees to keep their reputations up.

King Soopers,1bfifhnhsas0oa5i,4.0,"As night stock one will work for their money. The shift goes by quick, sometimes it can feel like there is more work than time. Can't speak on behalf of all management or co-workers, but like everywhere else it's hit or miss."
King Soopers,1bfhjv6o6ak4mclk,3.0,This job was okay as long as you are not in any management position. They do not treat their management well which often trickles down to the employees.

Everyone is friendly and easy to get along with. the pay is nice for just starting off, but the longer you work here it becomes less and less nice. A typical day was always busy here. Never a dull moment so its great for hard workers because they get to show how good they actually are. One thing they will do is schedule you A LOT. There were a couple weeks where I had 3 ten hour days. Being in retail, that kinda fry's your brain."

King Soopers,1be3rjbfdbrembuc,1.0,No one actually seemed to care about the decency of the workplace for the employees. I introduced myself to the store manager twice and she still couldn't remember my name. Honestly the only good aspect about that environment was the pay.
King Soopers,1be0n34fsaqi0ang,4.0,"The company itself is not too bad.  Generally they take care of people, but it's very demanding.  Hours you work can vary week to week, which is hard to budget for.  Your hours can be as low as 20 or as high as 40.  People who have been with the company longer have 'seniority"" which means they will get the better shifts, the better hours, and the better days off.  Sometimes this is ok, sometimes this leads to issues."

They never acknowledged any of the good I did for the company and instead when I made a stupid mistake (completely unintentional) I got fired for it (In all truth, I am positive, they were looking for a reason to get rid of me and they did... and I'm not the only person they've done this to either!) I put 100 percent of my life into them for 25 years and even went to college hoping I would move ahead... nope! They only want pompous people that their heads inflate the moment they get promoted. It used to be a great company to work for, family oriented and great opportunities to grow. Not anymore. They've been Krogerized and don't care at all about the people who put their life and soul into the company."

King Soopers,1bd4fg1jpak9l8u5,4.0,"I love working at King Soopers not just because of my co-employee that are friendly and the management are so good to their employees, but also meeting different types of customers is what I enjoyed the most maybe because I'm a people person."
King Soopers,1bd32tfo0ak5havg,2.0,"King Soopers can be a good place to work at if you like the people you work with, especially since the money can be good. It was pretty good for me for a while. Although I was working hard, I was pretty happy with my job. The pay is poor to start, but tops out nicely. Beware that the raises between year 1 and 3 are meager, then you get two huge raises in year 4."
King Soopers,1bd2uqno2ak9l89j,4.0,this company I wish due to health issues from the random style scheduling  didn't have to leave .
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."
King Soopers,1bcvqfl04ak5hfg8,2.0,"managers were rude, unhelpful and would not work with you for a flexible schedule while I was in college. Had to quit school in order to       continue work. If i need help pushing carts in from out side managers did not send anyone out. If someone else did I was sent out to help them. Managers changed schedules last minute, mostly the day before, even though posted schedules are final."
King Soopers,1bctch3q6akhdaou,4.0,"During my time with King Soopers the management was undergoing change. I noticed the stress this put on the other employees. Other than the continuous change that the company was going through, my fellow employees were amazing to work with. Everyone at King Soopers is very productive and puts their job first on and off the clock."
King Soopers,1bct1l91rakhd9ip,4.0,"Each Licensed  Starbucks location I worked at were very busy stores, and in some cases the only coffee shop nearby. One of the most important skills I learned working at Starbucks was how to lead a productive and supportive department where each person's skills were put to their best use. The hardest part of the job was Occasionally being short staffed and having to fill in the gaps. My favorite part of the job was socializing with the community and turning customers into regulars."
King Soopers,1bcr3uokdakhc8gr,3.0,"As friendly as every co-worker is, every face that walks by knows you, and every isle is clean, you are still the bottom of the food chain. When you start they make you do a lot more than you should because some of your co-workers like to take extensive smoke breaks as well as a disorganized schedule that completely messes any hope of a normal life."
King Soopers,1bcqvs94fak9ib5a,2.0,Lots of opportunity for advancement. Very friendly associates and great place to make friends. Poor management leads to over working the associates and leading them to feel burned out. Little to no advancement in pay. They will try to avoid paying you more if possible.
King Soopers,1bcqnp8plbrdhbp4,4.0,"Fun place to work if you are a people person, lots of customer interaction. lots of room to advance, company seems to promote from within.lots of customer service skills needed"
King Soopers,1bcjuet24ak9h86o,2.0,when you are salaried management there is no work life. Can barely get a family member birthday off. Consistently over worked without support from the district division level.
King Soopers,1bcj9rohc5n959cc,2.0,"I would go in to work, break down pallets and distribute to various isles. Learned how to be productive in a physical job. Upper management has their faults and can take them out on their employees. There was no since of workplace culture."
King Soopers,1bcgduqn0aqh4big,2.0,"The overall environment was disheartening, but advancement is based on seniority, so if you stay there you will move up the ladder, at least to some degree."
King Soopers,1bcdkn6ibaqh4crn,3.0,Room for growth and improvement but only so far and the compensation was never adequate. Does offer a good chance to move departments if work life ever becomes stale
King Soopers,1bcdebriobrdf9ir,5.0,"Hours are flexible, the managers are very understanding about almost anything. Everybody's so nice, I enjoyed working here! It was nice, you get paid every Thursday, that was my favorite. Overall great job!"
King Soopers,1bcc9c6gob89hbj0,5.0,"This is also a good first job, however the culture that is created among-st the employees is probably the most passive aggressive place. But this job taught me so many skills, like balloon decorating, customer service, and especially customer communication."
King Soopers,1bc9i06vpb81fe70,4.0,Regular large work load with few people to accomplish desired tasks. Co-Workers were undoubtedly the best part. A lot of scheduling issues and hours being cut frequently.
King Soopers,1bc83brhd5nd0et6,5.0,The experience was great because they worked with me where I was and helped me to advance to levels I never thought I would consider. Awesome values:)
King Soopers,1bc6saripak9ec8o,3.0,"A typical day at work would depend on the day of the week and the time of the day. Generally on the weekends, it is fairly busy. On week days, it is usually busy from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. The management team is highly dependable and professional. The work environment is mostly professional, with the exceptions of some young employees."
King Soopers,1bbk2fh1qakgsde2,3.0,"Extremely busy at all time, people skills grew here, management was average, culture was diverse, dealing with customers was the hardest but at the same time the most enjoyable"
King Soopers,1bb9vso57ak8lfft,3.0,The people you work with can be a little spotty. Some are great and some are horrible. It all depends on which manager favors you more to be honest. It is super competitive and hostile at times
King Soopers,1bavbu7r31aie1it,2.0,"If you absolutely need a job, they always hire...because people are always quiting.  The company is going down hill with new policy (which they don't actually follow through on) and more restrictive micro management style.  The upper management team has a very, do as I say not as I do mentality, and the culture is becoming more and more toxic.  I wouldn't recommend this company anymore, which is sad because I've put 6 years in.  It used to be a decent place to work."
King Soopers,1basc8d2u1ahf0ln,4.0,"I enjoyed the fast pace kind of work that King Soopers offered, not as a cashier, but as a customer service rep. and a night time stocking member. My managers were always ontop of things, and helped me advance in every way they could."
King Soopers,1banqfend1ags6hr,2.0,"Worked over nights to stock shelves. From 10pm to 6am, very hard work environment. Everyone is at each others throats, eventually help each other but with complaining. The night management was horrible. Instead of sending you help when you need it they talked down to you and make you want to quit."
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."

King Soopers,1baleoie21ai75ku,3.0,King Soopers is a great place to work if you are in high school or college and want some extra money. Not the type of place if you want a lifelong career.
King Soopers,1bai7qguo1bg67qt,3.0,Very busy. It was where I have learned how to become a pharmacy tech. The hardest part of the job was learning every thing and getting certificated within a 6 month time frame. I enjoyed everything about my job and learning new things everyday.
King Soopers,1baggsmnj1ahk4sc,3.0,"Love my job, loved the people I worked with and the customers. The management made your life difficult and did nothing but complain no matter how hard you worked. If it were not for the managers at this store I would still work for this company"
King Soopers,1bagdlvuf1ba454d,5.0,Working with many people with different backgrounds made it a great experience to learn how much others can offer to being in the same environment with you.

King Soopers,1ba6rd6ag1ahk41q,4.0,"The job is fun when you have a full, productive crew that works well together. The customers are what make this job worth it. They come in, you greet them with a smile and their name and they talk to you like a friend and it's great when they even know your name. The benefits aren't too shabby either and very inexpensive."
King Soopers,1b9tn9k80akdea0i,5.0,"I enjoyed this company as my long service here reflects, met nice people, worked for and with a great staff of poeple."
King Soopers,1b9oq563dak9e9p7,5.0,"Most days during the week are relatively busy, it begins to die down  around 7-8pm each day. I did not learn much working here. I got a long with all managers except for one, she was not easy to talk to and always got customer complaints. I did meet some pretty great people while working at King Soopers. I am friends with a lot of them still and often times have get togethers."
King Soopers,1b9hn2li7ak5bfkq,4.0,"In par of post graduation from college I needed a part time job to get some income. I applied mainly for the fact of the position being a good starting job. The job requires for early morning shifts starting as early as 2 in the morning and ending at 10:30 AM. Through most of the shift you'd be stocking and organizing shelves in your designated areas and other times tending to the backroom. I've managed to learn the amount of effort it takes to keep things up to code and stock as well as showing gratitude to the employees. For me the management of the store excels very well, although the manager for my department is tough to work with where on occasion one thing is out of place and everyone else the department gets a lecture for it. I'd say the hardest part of the job is maintaining a steady work pace. The best part of the job is helping customers and chatting with your co-workers."
King Soopers,1b9h5nk8qak5bf4u,3.0,It was an okay job but they made a lot of promises that they never kept. The people are nice and the job is relatively simple. The job was tedious though and was hard to get through especially when it was slow.
King Soopers,1b9gv5np9as1gct7,5.0,I would handle accounts for patients that recived medicine and needed it bill to insurance or were set up o payment plan for Medicine would the billing and follow up for collection on those claims.
King Soopers,1b9ghiderakh7d4l,3.0,"This was a great job, I would go back. The people were very nice, and the hours were good. The only thing that made me leave was that you never had 40 hours."
King Soopers,1b9gdsmn9akdbb0r,5.0,Working at King Soopers especially early before college or even college gives you a great outlook on life and how you can use this job to your advantage by putting this on applications showing King Soopers your a hard worker and everyone is friendly over there so it becomes more like a hobbie as you not just make friends but also learn how to deal with customers the proper way.
King Soopers,1b9g8sr3pakh7bl5,3.0,"Enjoyed the people I worked with, but that was all. Had issues with management. District coordinators are useless, had zero help from the front end one. She always made it someone else's problem when I had an issue that I didn't know how to solve."
King Soopers,1b9es9m3fb89gdc9,3.0,Nice benefits great hours nice crew and amazing managers. I worked the graveyard shift so I learned the ins and outs most people don't like working at night but I prefer it.

King Soopers,1b91kkn97as1eb5t,4.0,"It was my first job so I learned so much at young age. Mainly loyalty and work ethics. However started out with bagging groceries, then cashier. My favorite job was working at the photo department it was fun and it worked out with my school schedule perfectly."
King Soopers,1b91d5meuas1ecas,5.0,"Good place benefits,good pay and usually you could get 40 hrs.people were very nice and helpful. Clean and we'll stocked.If you couldn't get hrs.at your home store you could help in other stores if they needed it. Great source of vendors."
King Soopers,1b8ku16fkak8sfv4,5.0,"I worked at the service desk helping customers pay their utility bills, making money orders, cashing checks, selling tickets, send and receive money for customers, process returns. I learned how to read people and their true intentions when approaching the service desk. I can tell when someone was lying and telling the truth for their visit. Behind the service desk it was very busy but my co-workers were great people to work with that made the time there fun. The hardest part of my job was watching for customers doing fraudulent transactions. The most enjoyable part of my day was cashing out lotto tickets for winning customers."
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."
King Soopers,1b8iq1ohjb88rdgo,4.0,"Bagged and checked everyday, usually between 4-8 hour shifts. The management was good but they expected a lot out of us. They kept the store clean and they were efficient. The people that worked there varied a lot, courtesy clerks were usually teenagers. There are a lot of people working in one store so you don't meet everyone. The most enjoyable thing was the people I worked with, and the job was easy overall. The hardest part was having to move carts while the store was crowded, or when the weather was bad."
King Soopers,1b8dpa12jb87h9vq,5.0,Friendly environment with good compensation and benefits. The staff was always very nice and fun to be around. I worked with groceries and produce on a regular basis.
King Soopers,1b88nplfeakcpalb,3.0,"Okay place to work, liked it but also disliked because I was suppose to be a part time employee thats what I was hired under and then I kept getting full time hours and I would tell the  manager and she said ""someone quit so now you have to take their hours"" which wasn't okay they should have a plan if something like that happens instead of automatically put it on their other employees and expect them to be okay with their entire schedule changing."
King Soopers,1b852oj0tas0regd,3.0,"At King Soopers, we need to get to work on cashiering and bagging immediately, which is challenging and tedious, yet once done, it's very satisfying. Lots of customers every day, yet it's good to help others and start conversations."
King Soopers,1b82tvcvq5j5tf5o,4.0,"I did not work in the Pharmacy.  I worked in Retail, Warehousing, and Marketing over the last 36+ years.  This company has been very good to me and my family."
King Soopers,1b80i31qmak4n8hk,4.0,"Typically I make sure the front end (check stands and service desk) run smoothly and efficiently. I've learn excellent customer service skills and how to manage and coach others on my team. It's an enjoyable job, only stressful when you're extremely busy and understaffed. I enjoy the people I work with and the customers I help."

King Soopers,1b7tsri571ago5q9,5.0,Great system in place
King Soopers,1b7t985c35ndocoe,3.0,"Working as a courtesy clerk has been an interesting experience. Get the chance to talk to people, learning to meet and greet new people, and have the freedom to move around instead of sitting or standing in one spot. Bagging groceries was only part of my job there. I also pulled carts, ran the cash register, and provided effective customer service. Though the pay isn't all that good, the employees are really friendly, and know how to get the job done as a team."
King Soopers,1b7od160u1bg25cv,5.0,"King Soopers is an excellent place to work for if you have worked there for a long time, they are union so as the contracts get negotiated they seem to have less benefits and compensation. The union makes it hard for people to move up and get hours, this being the reason i am looking for another job. Everyone that works in my store is very nice and personable."
King Soopers,1b7o4vdpg1bg20vs,3.0,"King Soopers as a whole is very focused on customer service and making sure customers are taken care of. I wish I could say the same about their employees. The standards they expect of employees are valid and customers deserve it; however if employees were given the tools and looked at as more than a piece of paper the whole system would work to everyone's benefit astronomically better. I always gave my best for the customers, with little to nothing in return from the Company."
King Soopers,1b7eo9kqdak5pfdk,3.0,"King Soopers was a great environment for interacting and connecting with customers. However, the position of courtesy clerk was overworked, and work distribution was often unfair depending on the manager present. I did really enjoy getting to interact with the customers and other employees."
King Soopers,1b7ei1hteak9p9mj,3.0,"Good job for people who do not want to further there careers. Ready, fire, aim is the company attitude.  Hard work for minimum wage."
King Soopers,1b7caddt1akdqb3b,4.0,"It was alright. I guess if I had to I would work there again, I did enjoy the time I spent there. I did make some friends while there whom I am still in contact with semi regularly."
King Soopers,1b7bfpvkdas1kfgr,5.0,"A normal day at work is bagging peoples groceries, helping peopleo out if they need help, pushing carts, and checking people out. What Ive learned from this job is that you have to be very patient, have self control and be able to multitask. The management in King Soopers is very good and kind. Workplace atmosphere is cheery, everyone helps each other. Hardest part of the job is being able to take criticism because if you want to say something you cant because the customer is always right."
King Soopers,1b78veadrak5jasf,5.0,"From my work in most departments, advancement and recognition came hand and hand. Positions gave great opportunity to learn and expand in already growing skills. Always a wonderful cast of people that make the work that much more enjoyable. Hardest part of the job is investing the time."
King Soopers,1b779gni3ak9e85m,2.0,"It's an ok place to work as long as you are able to make it your number one priority, despite the fact that it doesn't pay a living wage, unless you want to progress to management. I am leaving this job because I can't be promoted as long as I maintain my commitments to my children's schedule. Also, you work very hard for mediocre benefits and a wage that is minimum wage or slightly higher, unless, you work in management - in which case, you will need to be married to your job. Having said that - I enjoy my co-workers and my customers."
King Soopers,1b74sqfmfakh4fo2,3.0,"King Soopers is a great place to work, but it is not a great place to stay. I worked there for years and I moved up and was on my way to be promoted once again, however it was time for me to go."
King Soopers,1b6ppr3j5akdjc09,2.0,"Management at King Soopers was incredibly disappointing. The only thing I liked about working there were the benefits, which included a healthcare plan. Management cares little for your overall satisfaction and would rather replace you than accommodate your needs. An example of this is when they wouldn't let me take my partner to the hospital when he really needed it. The least they would do was let me take him to the hospital, dump him there, and then come back to work."
King Soopers,1b6cpiv2eak97emk,3.0,Don't expect to get paid much unless you work your way up to a head clerk or work for a while in the pharmacy.

King Soopers,1b67sdffgb85a8s1,4.0,"Ok first job. It's not as bad as fast food anyway. Union takes dues from everyone, even if you make minimum wage or are not in the union. Basic customer service with no set schedule at all."
King Soopers,1b64sncplakd3drr,2.0,The atmosphere isn't great there. The managers are OK. The people in charge of hiring are not good. They fired me for a stupid reason.
King Soopers,1b5vlp8olak8pah7,4.0,miss working there.  Miss the pay and benefits.  still have friends I worked with that I keep in touch with. Just don't miss the big city
King Soopers,1b5qmnau7as0pce3,3.0,I moved up quickly for the pay.  Compensation is pretty good compared to same jobs elsewhere.  My position is getting more and more stressful and the expectations and goals are starting to become unattainable. The higher up positions are who you know.
King Soopers,1b5oh75faas0pd3p,3.0,Our union really helped with fare wages ad holiday pay as well. I loved my co-workers and store staff too. Store management was very helpful and willing to add hours to pharmacy staff for better customer service.
King Soopers,1b5og9upnak8p9vk,4.0,"They kind of throw you to the wolves with training, but theyre supportive and understanding when you have questions.  Still kind of learning about the job"
King Soopers,1b5nk113fak8pbj0,5.0,This has been the best company I have worked for in a while. I have received many customer service Osat awards. The upper management does a good job of taking care of employees.
King Soopers,1b5ln53q11ba20mj,3.0,"The King Soopers I worked at was very busy, but that wasn't so bad it made the day go by faster. What was really bad about working here though was the flexibility in schedule. Since I was new there I had to wait for like 20 other people to decide if they wanted a day off before I could get a day I really needed off. Tried talking to the boss about this but he said that was the way it goes."
King Soopers,1b5jb590kb854bbl,3.0,"great co- workers and overall enjoyable job. Can advance, and many areas of store to transfer over to if desired. Many locations, could transfer to another store if desired"
King Soopers,1b5gg9tvbb8aif1f,4.0,Overall a good place to work. I liked working with the Union. The manager of the store was very difficult to work with and the company allowed her to continue in this fashion because of her numbers.
King Soopers,1b5g8bhl11ah675p,5.0,I pushed carts for an hour and then after I would bag for customers and keep them company while they wait to be cashed out I stocked things needed on sales floor once and awhile and helped with general customer questions and concerns
King Soopers,1b5b7lkts0mt9796,3.0,"If you are looking for a full time position it is almost unheard of. They have good benefits and flexible scheduling if you are looking for that. Since the go off of the union, it is hard to move up in the company."
King Soopers,1b56qgsqo1agh4bi,4.0,"Overall, I really enjoyed working here, but because it's based off of seniority, unless you plan on being there for more than 5 years, you won't get many hours. There are pay raises for every year that you've been there once you move out of the courtesy clerk position. Management just really depends on the store you get. My experience was pretty positive with them. We were treated well, had dinners, parties, etc., and were rewarded for doing good jobs. I struggled changing positions from courtesy clerk to cashier (which pays a $1.00 more an hour) because I did a good job as a CC and they didn't want me to move. The hardest part is probably all the physical parts. It wears you out. From carts, to lifting turkeys and soda packs all day, to stacking boxes filled with produce. It's not for the weak. My favorite part is the coworkers. Don't get me wrong, there's always gonna be that one that you can't stand, but overall I really enjoyed working with those people. I learned that being able to get along with your coworkers and getting on the good side of management makes a HUGE difference in how good or bad a job can turn out to be."
King Soopers,1b53uop8f1bg16js,4.0,"Although it at times was hectic, overall quite fulfilling with knowing help was provided to the patients with medication. Learned how to interact with people, time management, and multi-tasking. Management was very understanding and flexible. Coworkers created a family-like atmosphere in the work place. Most difficult part of the job was being given the task of informing a patient that I could not fill their prescription(s). The most enjoyable was being able to help with the education of the patient with their medication and saving the patient as much money as possible."
King Soopers,1b51ovr580kbr2bj,5.0,I enjoyed working at King Soopers. The management was great! I had the opportunity to work different departments during my employment. The more you learn the better.
King Soopers,1b4mo3jjjakbkaud,5.0,"King Soopers gave me the chance to expand my knowledge and experience within a more direct employee to customer work space. I learned how to approach and greet customers which helped me to move into a more confident personal space. My social abilities expanded faster than I expected. My knowledge of a warehouse setting was also challenged as I had to move product from the truck the freezer and back out to the floor to meet customer demand. All in all, I am very proud of the experience I gained at King Soopers."
King Soopers,1b4d1ej21akavcgr,3.0,"Moved up many times in my career, still room for advancement, but cannot afford to live on my own...this company needs to do cost of living raises."

King Soopers,1b3qr2v99ak56a5g,4.0,"The hardest part of working nights was the foreman bugging you every hour,asking how much longer. Other then that everything else was okay. New management now I'm not sure how everything is going."
King Soopers,1b3luva76ak4v9h0,4.0,"average of 8 hour shifts, nice to interact with customers of all ages, co-workers are good people but little chatter which isn't always a bad thing.

King Soopers,1b3gp14u6ak4v8ql,3.0,"Very little training is given, yet a lot is expected of you.  Management positions work you to the bone and demand a lot.  Great benefits and a 401k."
King Soopers,1b3foptnk5ndiep1,5.0,Clock in for your shift received a break every two hours. I learned a little about being a manager co-workers were awesome and friendly. The hardest part of the job was being understaffed and the most enjoyable part of the job was actually getting to know my customers.

King Soopers,1b3d14m90aqh785e,1.0,Their turnover rating at every store is ridiculous. Management expects everything to be done within the amount of time given in each shift. I worked their for a few years and still know people who work there and the complaints are continuous. I wouldn't work there unless our a teenager trying to get through school or you don't care to move forward in a career.
King Soopers,1b337hljnak9ua79,1.0,"Advancement is all about who you know and not what you know. Store management are very unprofessional and do not care about their employees.

King Soopers,1b2mb1cn0ak9jdii,4.0,Good place to work until i had to have back surgery. Then was told i had to resign or be fired while recovering from back surgery. That King Soopers does not support Employees who are hurt or recovering from surgery. this was told to me by the new manager.
King Soopers,1b2k9ika9b86eeq5,2.0,"Kroger does not promote employees based on merit, just how long they have been with the company.  Most managers are not ecucated, just been working their since high school, and that is their level of education.  Customers are very rarely nice and pleasant to deal with."

King Soopers,1b27l95s2ak9c8k4,2.0,There are great people you get to meet and work with but the management is rough. They are unwilling to help many associates and pick favorites most of the time.If you want to move up in the company you have to be a favorite. Benefits are not bad and the day is always busy.

King Soopers,1b1cnpi9tb84p8c7,5.0,The job was pretty simple but had a lot of variety.  I enjoyed being able to work different positions when needed so I was never bored with the position.  I enjoyed the customer service aspect but the customers were fairly spaced out during later shifts which is when I was able to help different areas of the store for experience.  The people I worked with were wonderful and always helpful.

King Soopers,1b09ll94qb83bfhg,4.0,"All told, a demanding and repetitive job, yet with plenty of different and evolving tasks, including face to face customer service and up selling. Cleaning is paramount, and new hires should expect to do the majority of the grittier tasks. The company prioritizes seniority of work experience in terms of task assignment and scheduling. With this in mind, all management level employees actually do work every day, and spent less time in meetings or off site than comparable deli outfits. All coworkers were highly trained and appropriately able to perform through the work day, yet fatigue and seniority issues can plague team morale"

I enjoyed the stability of my job and felt i was paid well for my experience and knowledge of the business. I was promoted based on my experience in fields that i qualified for and was treated fairly while being promoted to management positions. I would recommend this company for anyone who wants to pursue a quality job in retail sales. However, this occupation does not afford you much time to enjoy weekends or holidays as demand is at its highest during these times. The benefits over time are worth putting in the time to receive them. Good company but personally Kroger is a much better work environment and management is more in touch with associates needs and opinions. They offer union protection but will soon phase out the worker's right to assemble with UFCW."
King Soopers,1au941ulk5nd3c72,4.0,"The job was good until they changed management, the Forman was huge on promoting up if you put forth the effort to. Unfortunately the supervisors Rodger and Nathaniel are usually on an ego trip feeling like the king scooper gods and think there over the Forman but if you let Kenny know he will take care of it. Besides that the co-workers are very helpful in working with new people. Kenny and Gail are very grounded when it comes to work flow and keeping people on track."

King Soopers,1atu63ima1d0d7su,4.0,"A typical day at work in the Grocery Department consists of stocking shelves, filling outs on shelves, and organizing shelves for customer perusal. The management is currently good at the Colfax and Quail store in Lakewood, CO. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, most people that are employed there have good attitudes and good work ethics. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the general public in Lakewood, CO. The customers there don't have a good sense of manners or politeness. Although, many retail places have customers that don't treat the employees well or appreciate them. The most enjoyable part of working at King Soopers would have to be working with people that have fun at work, as well as do the work efficiently."

King Soopers,1aqvigh8kak5palg,5.0,Like working here as I enjoy the customers and the co workers I work with. I only wish they would do 2 week schedules and post ahead of time as they only do one week at a time which is rather ridiculous as you can't make plans not knowing what your days off will be each week as I find it very difficult to try and schedule any doctor's appointments. I tried mentioning to them about trying to do 2 weeks scheduling as they only think of themselves and rather screw  their associates as it is not fair at all.

I learned the ins and outs of the deli industry and how much it really takes to run a team of people as well as keeping the department you are in charge of running smoothly. Management wasn't the greatest but that is not their Fault Because your employees can only be as good as the beliefs that you have for them.

King Soopers,1am7blg44b88sf9m,3.0,A typical day at work would be just clocking in and getting on a register. What I learned was to scan produce really fast. Management was very nice if we were short handed they would jump in and pitch a hand. My co-workers were also very nice we all did the same job so no one ever sat around. The hardest part of the job was staying hunched over the check out stand. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and making friends at work.

King Soopers,1ale8ni6iak5t8vg,4.0,"Working for King Soopers is ok. Most days are working busy on the weekends since most people have time off to come to the store and get groceries. Some customers are nice and understand how the business is, but other will try and take advantage of the store to try and get money back. Management was good for the most part as far as the store management, but some department management can get very messy at times. Most of the co-workers I have worked with are nice people, including some of the high school kids, but some you can tell have worked there foe too long, and want no part of being in a team. The hardest part of the job is putting up with difficult customers, because you don't want to make them mad, but you also want to obey the store policies to avoid from getting a write up. The most enjoyable part of the job is being recognized by customers who acknowledge how hard the employees have worked."

King Soopers,1alau12tdak5j8v9,1.0,"As an associate in Lower management at King Soopers I have had almost the worst experience working there in my entire life. I learned a lot through the intense stress and tough situation the stores of this company go through on a daily basis. A typical day for me as a night crew foreman is starting at 12 o'clock midnight, going over the daily paperwork and checking emails to see what is current with day management, bringing down repack, unloading a truck stocking our older stock to the shelves before stocking new stock to the shelves and them bringing every item in the store forward before 7 am. sometimes not even getting off work until 10am-3pm sometimes! The people who work there are quite nice but highly taken advantage of by the higher ups, and never fully trained or given proper training before being given responsibilities. the most enjoyable part of the job would be being a good leader and role model to my associates. the hardest part is dealing with the unreasonable expectations giving to the associates and still trying to keep their moral."
King Soopers,1al83m6e0ak5j9l2,2.0,"Kings was a great place to work. As time passed, the company focus moved away from traditional Grocery practices to a contrived series of corporate directives that did not support daily operations. This process of change required sub-standard management recruits. The resulting in-store management teams lacked the experience or competence to maintain  basic daily operations. When corporate leadership visited the stores, hundreds of hours of overtime was required just to present a normal level of service during the time of the visit. Communication was happenstance and ineffective. Management follow-through was non-existent. All levels of in-store management participated in ""The Blame Game""."

I learned how to take care of plants and properly water them, also how to provide great customer service to every patron that entered the store. The hardest part of the job was dealing with my co-workers who constantly didn't want to work which made for a very weird environment within the store.

The repeated promises that they failed to uphold concerning scheduling were very difficult to endure, and eventually led to my loss of willingness to work there. They were trying to leverage seniority and other immature factors against me, which I found demoralizing, yet everyone I spoke with had had the same experience. This is possibly why they have such a high turn-over rate at their store locations in Boulder, CO."

After completing deliveries came back turned in money collected and loaded up more deliveries and delivering them and collecting money. Pretty much doing that the entire day. At end of day turned in rest of money and change bag, turning in the delivery log and parking the van in proper place. Coworkers were great and very helpful, hardest part was mainly the weather if it was really cold and snowing and the roads were icy, Mountain deliveries were especially hard during those times.

King Soopers,1ag5n7jmuakbobnk,3.0,"A typical day at work can be challenging at times. I have 2 types of people who come in good and bad. Most of the time i have to remember they are customers. On the other hand, the good people (regulars) drive through. Indeed, they make my day. What i learned from a fuel Clerk job you have to have a good attitude and be aware of sales, checking gas pump equipment, also a clean environment. Management are always welcoming and they will always have something to resolve a problem to work around it in a good way for their emplyees. The coworkers on the other hand some can be good some can be bad. Either it was the earliest they work or families they attend to afterwards. It is understandable. But I give a good respect for the coworkers who work hard for their families, money on the side for school, experience if they are in high school. As far as the hardest part was the minimum wage for a twenty year old to make ends meet. Rent, utilities, fees, phone bill, etc.The most enjoyable part of the job was being with people who I got along with. Don't get me wrong i get along with everyone.

They suspend you before they give you a ride up and investigate the reason. But if they realize they were very short-handed (this is why i work thriugh lunch akmost daily no breaks except bathroom)how do they expect you to be perfect. If you pay peanuts you get monkeys and King Soopers is turning into a zoo
King Soopers,1afot5ihpakb1anj,2.0,"Job pays very well, but management is unprofessional & play favorites. Kroger only cares about shrink, but took away the tools for us to stop shoplifters. They rather we observe & report & not get involved."
King Soopers,1afjirfh5akame5q,5.0,"Enjoyed working at the front desk, greeting clients."
King Soopers,1af432lblakabano,4.0,"I worked multiple different departments and locations throughout my 11 years at King Soopers. My last position at King Soopers was Night Crew Foreman. I would arrive an hour before my crew to start setting up. We would spread the pallets of product throughout the store, then spot the items near the location to stock them. After stocking the items we would face the shelves to make the store look as nice as possible for the day of business to come. I learned a lot about maintaining inventory and what items sold most at the different times of the year as well as the different locations of the stores. Management was very educated and helpful. Most of my coworkers were very fun to work with and pitched in extra help when the crew was short handed. The hardest part of the job was training new employees that felt the position should've been easier and they were resistant to working hard and eventually would quit. Not all new employees were this way, but the ones that were-were difficult to deal with. The most enjoyable part of my job was the exercise and the upbeat attitude that most night crew employees possessed."
King Soopers,1af1fkicuaka8eor,3.0,"The employees were very friendly. The management was fair most of the time. I enjoyed the work for the most part but they wanted more all the time. The pay was not very good, Kroger company has many benefits if you are working full time. Part time employees were not privy to all the benefits"
King Soopers,1aenfhm3jas1uc6m,2.0,A typical day at King Soopers is breaking down the daily load and stocking it to the shelves for the customers. Customer service is a daily activity that is very important to the company. I have learned to order for the needs of the store. Hardest part of the job is the manual labor attached to it. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the amazing employees that also work there and some of the vendors that come into the store.
King Soopers,1aejr6t0sb81maeg,4.0,"My typical work day was pretty busy and could have quite a lot of physical labor ,but allowed me to learn many things that I ,honestly, should have known. My co-workers were very accepting helpful and friendly. I loved almost all of the work but carts was probably the hardest part of the job."
King Soopers,1adttivn0b81mc8n,2.0,"overall the work place is a atmosphere for some people. management is never on their game, but learned a lot from the people that were actually dedicated and wanted to help others."

King Soopers,1adc0tgeiak9o9ck,4.0,"The days went by quickly; hardly anytime to breathe, though. The service desk is extremely busy. I was pushed along very quickly and left alone to learn on my own too soon. Sometimes found it hard to get someone over to help out with things I didn't know how to handle - which there was a lot. For what you're expected to do, the pay was way to low."
King Soopers,1acpk9svdak7se9j,3.0,"I enjoyed Helping people and the people I worked with. Did not like the fact that it was not full time. I stocked shelves,cashiered, rotated stock and removed out of date and damaged product to reduce shrinkage."
King Soopers,1acnhon37ak96c6m,5.0,It is a great place to start and learn to grow. You can work your way up fast and learn how to be a manager and what will make you successful. They really do care.
King Soopers,1ace79n6bak7jddl,4.0,i was always busy and on my feet i got along with my coworkers and  i learned how to do new things like cashier. the hardest part was during the holidays because it was busier then normal. i enjoyed working with my coworkers to get things done.
King Soopers,1acd77ap7b84oetv,4.0,"Going straight into guest mode here, you learned how to handle guest in any manner. The management very strict. Everyone was very friendly and worked hard here. Hardest part of job was bouncing between lanes. Most enjoyable part was seeing everyone I know in town."
King Soopers,1accj29gtas178kf,2.0,Same routine which made it very boring but there was never a time I didn't have anything to do. Management never seemed to care to get to know you or talk to you.

King Soopers,1ac5gg3e75ne5dg8,4.0,Can be a really good career if you put in the initial time and can handle retail hours. Starting out can be tough and difficult learning everything and how to get it all done. Depending on your position and time of day your work day can be steadily busy and go by quick or slow and drawn out with a couple hectic of times. Be ready to be on your feet all day and deal with repetitive and/or moderately hard work. No matter the economy everybody needs to eat and is union so has good job security.
King Soopers,1ac2mhae7ak78crj,1.0,"Terribad. Like really really bad. Don't work here if you can avoid it. I have heard better things about other stores but mine was poorly organized, poorly manged and the culture was absolutely horrid."
King Soopers,1abvtdc4sak78fsm,3.0,No job security along with no training accompanied by accountability for what you don't know. If you are moved to a new location then you have to start over on proving yourself.

King Soopers,1abqu6vhlak8q8h5,5.0,"I really liked the retail experience at King Soopers. We had a fast working environment. I learned how to get my jobs done in a limited time, how to deal with customers, how to dispense medication safely and accurately and many more. I gained a lot working there."
King Soopers,1abqa705sak78ak3,4.0,"Typical days consisted of taking care of patients with their medications. We made sure that our customers were satisfied with the service and helped them to understand their insurance copay. We would enter in prescriptions making sure our the information on the hard copy matched what was on the computer. We fill prescriptions and made sure we matched the bottle to the label that printed out. Next, we would release the medication to the patient and ran the registers. Working here made me learn numerous things, From handing out scripts to ordering controlled narcotics to managing old prescriptions and knowing how to properly put them away for storage. My manager is wonderful he is a hard working person who is neat and knows what is needed to be done when certain things are due that is required by corporate. He makes our day easy and not frustrating at all. My co-workers are wonderful they help me when I don't understand some of the rejections the we get from insurances. Its nice when you have some one else there who can help you when its something you get stuck on. The hardest part of the job is customer service and making sure your patients get what they need. Its tough sometimes when you don't have the answer a patient is looking for. On top of that you have to meet corporate's standers of how fast you need to be when a patient is waiting for their medication. They require at least 15 minutes of one prescription to be done. It can be tough sometimes when you have 10-15 waiters come in at the same time and on top of that you have to help your second window which is release to"

King Soopers,1a9t3d5r0ak5ra9t,4.0,This was my first job so i don't remember much but it was very easy and the people there where kind of care free. Nothing to hard to handle just make sure you have good customer service and you are on time every day. over all it was a good experience. The management could get more organized .
King Soopers,1a9qo3v1vak5rbr8,3.0,I learned a lot about hospitality and the workings of retail. the cheese island taught me a lot about the culture and history of cheese and how to apply my carisma and knowledge to supply the best and most personal service as possible.

King Soopers,1a9gknhvtakbfags,4.0,"Working at this store, i was always busy with little down time.

King Soopers,1a9gae4n6ak5rcv5,2.0,"We're do I begin! I was trained by someone who was leaving, so she didn't care how I was trained! Within my first week 4 different people trained me? Four different  ways! Confused, yes I was! I was told there would be some nights! Well technically  no I worked a 2 am  shift to 10:30! They normally have 2 full time bakers but at the store I worked they had one! So I opened on his days off! the other days I came in at 5 or 6 am! So sleep was all over the place! Days off were also or non existence! The schedules were not out by Friday when the new week begins on monday! Which made it hard to plan anything at all! I had a list of things I needed to do,I worked my bum off, came in before time, worked through my breaks and still didn't get them done! Then they added things to my list? The frozen bread was clumped frozen in a block mess! So I'd have to unthaw them work them into a loaf, which took time away from other things! Things I had no control over! My 45 day review was awful! I was crying knowing I was doing all I could and here they were telling me it wasn't good enough! They were going to move me to bakery clerk and cut my hours! Since every day was different the next day I didn't have that much to do and got all done! The management  was all about their schedule! They would leave to go take smoke breaks leaving me to deal with everything! The phone, customers, the ovens etc! I was lamb pasted for not getting to the deliveries  put away! which even the head baker at times never got too!  The one manager left notes one day explaining my opening as a bleep show,leaving it where"
King Soopers,1a9e9qce9ak5rc59,3.0,"I say good environment because its working with customers that made everything better, I like seeing are regulars come in and joke with us. My boss was awesome. Showing that I was working hard and if any stores needed help and need more hours she would ask me to go to that store to help out with other co-workers meaning I got to work with different people and see how that store did there deli and maybe learn something new. Yes, I did have some co-workers there that did not work well with others since they worked there longer and didn't like the changes or didn't like helping people out if they were busy but like I said at the beginning working with customer at the store made it all better."

King Soopers,1a6upr14qak6iaum,1.0,At the time i was a working student and I found it difficult to find the time to study cause no matter how many times I had asked I would be scheduled right after school and have to work well into the night. My breaks were never on time and senior members were treated better. I always felt like an outsider though I made many attempts with my ex-coworkers to include me. I was always scheduled late into the night and most times wouldn't have a way home cause the bus had stop running and I wasn't able to get a ride. It was a horrid place to work and i never want to work in a place like that again.

Management was a little too laid back. Most co-workers were hard workers. The most enjoyable part about the job was there were many holiday lunches and parties so the entire staff were all friendly to one another.
King Soopers,1a5d7pnlqas1784f,5.0,"Fast paced, helpful knowledge, friendly customer service, best food people on the planet and Kroger is the best American company ever!!!"
King Soopers,1a5ct9f1tak95ag0,3.0,I was a merchandiser for the GM dept and worked the front end self check out I learned that advancement in a company is harderthan you think and not all companies stick to their promised values after you are hired.Management was terrible and not hands on or aware at all. The hardest part of the job was getting a set schedule. I loved merchandising in the the GM dept and I loved the customer service oart I loved meeting new people and just making them happy during their shopping experience.
King Soopers,1a58b04k9as17bng,3.0,Not Professional at all. You could not tell the managers from homeless people on the street. No work ethic among employees. Do not work here.

King Soopers,1a5132rpub84l8s7,3.0,Well a typical day at work at would be I go in about 7:30am and I face my department and then I work the load and work till 9:30am take a 15 minute break then I continue working on the load. Sometimes interact with co-workers if it's not to busy then usually my manger tells me to fill holes in the department so I step away from the load and fill holes then take a 30 minute lunch. And then finish load about 3:00pm then work on markdowns till I go home at 4:00pm and I would say the hardest part of the job would be trying to finish the load while trying to acknowledge every customer and taking them to the item that they need and bring pulled up front to help check customers out and bag groceries and most enjoyable part of the job would be laughing and joking with co-workers and management.

King Soopers,1a4vrpk4bak9582o,3.0,"Most days were routine, however, there would always be some important person coming in every few weeks which would send the story into manic mode. I learned different cuts of meat and how to package/price them. Management was very back and forth, and would often contradict themselves. They were wonderful people, but communication was not the greatest. The hardest part of the job was making the customers happy. People can be very rude, but nothing too hard. The most enjoyable parts of the job are coworkers and the nice customers."
King Soopers,1a4qm6gp1b80hd9r,3.0,"I work overnight leading a team of people to get the dry grocery section of the store stocked, organized and visually maintained. It's one of the hardest jobs in the store that comes with a lot of stress. Not the worst job that I've worked but also not the best job. The pay is ok, the benefits are good except you don't have any upfront vacation time until after 1 year of service. My grocery manager is a great guy and very thankful of the hard-work we put in. I just wish store management was just as thankful. This is a very fast-paced and physical job that requires a person to learn the store quickly. With that said, there is very little time for any formal training. I've had to ask numerous times to be trained in certain areas and only shown a few things here and there when a few minutes are available. This is by far the worst company I've worked for in terms of a comprehensive training program for employees. There's some computer coursework but after that you're on your own. Their method is trial by fire. The dry grocery department is an ok place to work."
King Soopers,1a48sebk2as0oa7b,3.0,"No-one can live on the amount of pay you receive - only a highschool student who lives at home and mommy and daddy are paying all the bills... - only Kroger brand discounts offered - -- be ready a to be non- stop action as store is so busy - customers complain not enough help-- that's because they don't pay enough to keep workers to stay - people quiting every week and someone always out sick-- they ask for more hours out of you or come in on your day off but can't go over partime hours -- cause they don't want to pay you for that.. Bottom line - No money involved-  Aside from that , some great co-workers and and some good bosses -- but that won't be enough to keep good employees -"

King Soopers,1a3s292jhak8i8j7,3.0,Work is tiresome but not difficult. Management is a bit abrasive at times and the pay is mediocre. Hours tend to be inconvenient and working in such a large store means the hours you request off usually aren't honored.
King Soopers,1a3n087t11ahd4iv,4.0,"King Soopers is a fun and rewarding place to work. Although scheduling is mostly non negotiable, it can be difficult to schedule outside work activities.

The management is all over the place but the co-workers are good people who just want to survive just like everyone else at a work place.  The most difficult part of the job is solving customer issues that are not easy in the first place.  That can also become the most enjoyable part of the job though, since solving the problem can be such a relief as well as feeling like a job well done.  It is worth experiencing for learning how to navigate other people."

It is a very stressful job. It has been a very stressful ten years. Need a job where I can make a living, and this job is not it. I want to be a chef aside from my main career which is acting that I am currently working on. I need a fresh start, a brand new start and need a new job to start making a living.

Typically upon arrival our first responsibility was to work the release window; handing out prescriptions, handling any insurance issues, and providing exceptional customer service.  The next responsibility on the circuit was data entry.  Here I would process new prescriptions either faxed or emailed directly from a physicians office or hand written prescriptions brought in by patients.  The next spot on the circuit would be the 'fill' spot.  Here I would be responsible for filling, labeling, and verifying accuracy before handing it over to my pharmacist.  Other responsibilities I was responsible for was inventory, record keeping/filing, RTS, and general cleanliness of the pharmacy."

There was too much stress about getting a huge amounts of work done with not enough time to do it. Upper management would either complain because the Deli looked horrible (because we didn't get over time the night before) or complain that the Deli department had over time. The pay was not worth the stress to work in that department.

Over the years I have spent growing with this company I have seen it go through many changes. New programs are somewhat effective in everyday application, and most clerks are confused as to why some position responsibilities change. Recent developments in fine tuning customer service has been difficult for clerks; as we are told we are never working hard enough to meet the company goal. My subordinates, peers, and direct supervisors are always a pleasure to work with. Schedules are fit to mine as well as other students needs, managers have their subordinates best interest at heart. Safety is constantly monitored, and accident free days are rewarded."
King Soopers,19vturp7ub85nbsk,4.0,"Fun place to work with management that is not afraid to come and help the grunts. Good coworkers and overall friendly atmosphere.

Sometimes was understaffed which was another bummer since we had to do 4 different jobs a day."
King Soopers,19vjb5ci85namejn,5.0,"A typical day at King Soopers begins behind the customer service desk. I first ask if there are any special tasks that need my attention. After those items are taken care of, I check to see that all products in my area are stocked. Customers take up most of my time spent throughout the day. I help them with money orders, utility bills, wire transfers, returns and refunds, purchases, complaints, and any other issue that arises. I am also responsible for adhering to the laws of alcohol and tobacco sales, and observing any suspicious behavior that may lead to theft. If needed I will assist customers to their car with large items and also escort them to specific items in the store. The hardest part of the job is telling a customer I am not able to help them with something because I don’t have the authority to make that decision. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know my customers and having them request me to help. I’ve had more than 15 customer satisfaction letters turned in on my record. And knowing that it takes a lot of effort on their part to write up those positive reviews makes me feel good."

With that being said I did not enjoy working with my coworkers. the morning staff did not do anything, the night staff was dysfunctional, and I usually got stuck with most of the work. when an employee does 60% of your job they should be rewarded not punished with case-notes saying ""your taking to long to do other peoples jobs. focus on yourself and let the team as a whole fail.""

Management isn't always the best, some are hired to manage, but have never worked that department, so it makes it harder for the employees. The hardest part of the job is all the lifting, if you are not in shape and take care of yourself, this job will catch up to you. The best part of this job is meeting new people, not only new employees but also meeting new customers."

King Soopers,19tg9a2o7ak758ua,3.0,"Be prepared to work hard, work extra hours, see little return on your hard work other than a company provided luncheon every once in a while.  The demands of this company continuously increase year after year to the point where they can no longer find an adequate supply of staffing making the job even more difficult for employees who stick around."
King Soopers,19tg76kebak97epi,4.0,"Hours vary, it can be an easy and calm day. But it can also be a busy and hectic day so you will have to multi task."
King Soopers,19tdoarog52sob9n,2.0,Great company if you plan on investing years in order to become somebody. You learn alot at a fast pace but not enough employees to keep the customers happy.
King Soopers,19tcdsf1nas178p1,3.0,"At the customer service desk, its the same things all day long. A whole lot of angry customers and you can not do anything for them. Your responsibilities are handling large amounts of money, Western Union transactions such as money orders, transfers, and bill pays. You may like I did have to work at the gas station that is located across the parking lot. If I learned anything there its that you can never completely satisfy the customer no matter what you do.The management wasn't perfect by any means, they came in, did their job and that's about it. The co-workers in the customer service dept. were the best part of the job, most of them were very nice, helpful, and understanding. The hardest part of the job of course was dealing with customers. There wasn't any part of this job that I enjoyed in particular."
King Soopers,19t4l3qa45n969hs,4.0,"My overall experience was good. I have noticed over the last 4 years that the company is losing sight of customer service. The company has given more responsibilities  but in turn does not allow us to complete the task. We are literally timed in the pharmacy for everything we do. This includes time we spend at data entry, dispensing, working on insurance issues, and the most important job of giving our customers the attention each of them deserves. This new trend is really a disappointment."
King Soopers,19t44o9soak6a9nd,3.0,"Enjoyable work environment because of the amount of time spent connecting with the customer base.  Some long-time dedicated employees, but a lot of employee turnover.  This leads to poor choices in management promotions making for untrained leads which can make work hectic.  Also, seems the management (above store level) is disconnected from the everyday work place because of the size of the company."
King Soopers,19srufkc10mtf69l,3.0,"Learned customer service skills along with stocking skills. Management was very respectful, the hours however are very unstable."

King Soopers,19sg57broas0jehu,5.0,I transferred to a new store after almost 9 months at a location where everyone was unhappy and stressed.

King Soopers,19s7lepic5nbpdsu,1.0,I had worked for king soopers for a total of 20 years.  in the beginning the store and the obligations were attainable.  With in the last five or so years there was no over time and not enough bodies to get the work done.  The management would ask for things that weren't achievable with less than 8 men.  it wasn't worth the headache anymore.
King Soopers,1elgoaakcu2j4800,4.0,"I had very good relationship with managers, they were responsive, accommodating, and supportive. The over all environment was not the best, but it was a great temporary job."

King Soopers,19rnpqv8has3cek5,5.0,"Working at King Soopers was the most enjoyable job I've ever had. I definitely learned a lot of multi tasking skills, especially when I got promoted from Courtesy Clerk to Deli Clerk. My management was very detail oriented and really liked it when I asked questions about my job duties, which I did a lot in order to learn the most about my station. My co-workers were friendly and encouraging, especially when I moved positions. The best part of the job was making the customers happy; whereas, the hardest part of the job was ensuring the quality of the food products, especially in a timely fashion."
King Soopers,19rjpnsqh52v7e63,3.0,"Kingsoopers has given me the chance to jump start my pharmacy career. The company trained me and helped me get certified.

King Soopers,19qbuar6b52ua959,2.0,"Underpaid as a clerk, overworked as a manager. Upper management has no care about you or your needs. All that matters is numbers. Everyone is expendable. Union is a joke. If they like you where you are there is 0% chance of promotion."
King Soopers,19q57qetob822d4j,4.0,"I love being able to help some one with their dietary restrictions or help them ease an ailment by showing them the best supplement that I can.  It is rewarding when my customers come back week after week to tell me how much better they feel from taking what I suggested.  I don't talk to many coworkers because I am in a specialty department, but some of us become close working together and it is great.  The hardest part is that I can only do so much as a Nutrition Specialist at a grocery store."

King Soopers,19q1ng3ld52t8fie,1.0,"Unless you are in management, very poor pay. Management doesn't care about their employee's, or the potential of future employee's. Your schedule doesn't matter. I could be schedule 11 p.m. until 9:30 a.m. and be there until 2 in the afternoon. Your personal life doesn't matter to the company no matter how serious the situation might be. Yes, this is a union, but the union doesn't protect you."
King Soopers,19pvnstlgak9ffjc,3.0,Decent workplace but it could have been better. In my opinion it was very disorganized. Employees were great but management could've been better.
King Soopers,19pj78ama52t09vf,3.0,"I've worked here for 5 years the employees are great the immediate managers are most of the time great. Occasionally we will get an assistant store manager or store manager who is in touch but for the most part these people have never been a clerk and they don't understand how it is. It's a great place to work but be very wary... the people running the show make decisions based on numbers they don't know a single person that's below them. Just as an example if you manage a department and get  .25 hours of overtime across 13 people you, as the manager, are expected to ""write an overtime response"". If you know someone in the kroger business or really like to kiss a big ol butt go for it because that's the only way to get ahead around here"
King Soopers,19piqohb75n9697n,3.0,A typical shift involved running around in circles. I learned that in the service industry it is sometimes about how much you suck up not how well you work. The management was harsh and impersonal. My coworkers and the customers were the only bright parts of my shifts.
King Soopers,19ph0oi8eak94cns,5.0,Really great place to work. I love all my friendly coworkers. I cant stay because of the schedule. I have to work a different schedule every week and work weekends. I need Monday through Friday mornings to work with my daughters day care schedule.
King Soopers,19p3629fv5n92b7j,1.0,"Didn't like working here at all. Bad management, everything was a mess. It's good if your still in highschool. It was good for me at the time because I did'nt have many bills and I was young."
King Soopers,19okcaftaak4ib6t,4.0,"This position required a lot of attention and a lot of responsibility. I had to manage the whole inventory of a huge factory and i was the only one who took care of this out of 300 or more people that worked there. It was a great job because no one really managed me or told me what to do because I already knew my duty. I always did my best and I always achieved goals. The hardest thing about this job was my shift. I went in at 12am till 8:30am. In the end, it was a great learning experience."

King Soopers,19ogtdmr61d0e1p8,3.0,This was a part time position that was supposed to become full time and permanent.  They decided to close the store I was working at and the full time hours never materialized.
King Soopers,19ognlusk1ahf4qa,4.0,A typical day at work I usually bag items and push carts. Sometimes I am asked to do shop backs or put damaged items away. I help customers to their car if they need it and help carry heavy items. The co-workers are great I talk to some of them and they are nice. Most customers are really nice but sometimes we will get one that is not in a good mood. The hardest part of the job would probably be pushing carts because we do not have a cart pusher and have to do it by hand. It can get tiring and miserable when it is very hot or cold out. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to talk with my co-workers and the customers who have a good story and are very nice.
King Soopers,19oetfdf2ak4id35,4.0,"Everyday I would consistently be part of a four person team that would handle anywhere from 1200 to 2000 cases daily for the grocery department alone. I'd help sort through 20+ pallets of product unloaded off a truck and organize them to their respective aisles before stocking the product at a high pace. The hardest struggle was directing members of the crew to different tasks due limited man power, ie having six members to spread out for grocery, dairy, freezer and naturals."
King Soopers,19obg3thfak4i973,4.0,they recognized my hard work and placed me in the pharmacy where i got excellent training and they also paid for my certification test.

King Soopers,19o71hnuf1ahf0tc,5.0,King Soopers and its parent company Kroger is one of the best companies to work for. They are union so it make it hard to advance very rapidly and are seniority based. For someone like me who is a work horse and wants rapid advancement it is not the best situation. But for people who want a stable work place that is friendly and is employee centered it is the perfect place. It is a great place just not a fit for me.
King Soopers,19o26vlkbas0iavk,3.0,"The work days are long during the summer, you work in the cold, and you stand on your feet all day. I learned its not what you know, its who you know that can get you ahead in the company. Co-workers are sometime difficult to work with. The hardest part about my job is working in the cold, and the easiest part is the job itself."
King Soopers,19nkl95ji1d032kf,5.0,A typical day at work was busy. My responsibilities required a lot of physical movement. My management was alright. I loved the upper management of the store. They were helpful. Coworkers were awesome. Hardest part of the job was pushing the carts into the store in bad weather. Enjoyable part of the job was cashiering and everything I did inside.

King Soopers,19lpi4ekqb82ma93,4.0,"A typical day at work would be hectic but not overwhelming. Working in the deli I had a lot of fun and was able to make new relationships with the people I worked with daily. I learned how to work stronger with a team rather than on my own. The management was not too bad, but I did have questions about my direct manager. Overall, the management of the company was very welcoming and understanding. My coworkers were a lot of fun to be around and they really helped push me to work my hardest. They answered any and all questions I might have had when first starting at King Soopers. The hardest part of the job was being in the back of the deli frying the chicken and making sure the hot sides were always fully stocked and taken out when they were supposed to be taken out. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and helping all the customers that would come in on a daily basis. I really enjoyed being able to meet and get to know all the regulars I would get and be able to make their experience at King Soopers something to look forward to."

King Soopers,19kg3mb7pas1edcs,3.0,During my time with this company it was rewarding and full of challenges. I had a great deal to learn as a employee of King Soopers. I spent my prier retail experience as a meat cutter in the cutting room. For the most part a lot of the customer service was new to me but I learned quickly and became a top notch employee.

King Soopers,19k66cgqkb81g8ap,3.0,"King Soopers is an average company to work for, in the last eight years I have seen a drastic change in how management treats their employees. It used to be more like a family company, with company functions and holiday parties and showing appreciation toward them. Now they do not do not have these functions that make you want to work for the company."
King Soopers,19k3et68a5ncobdb,2.0,"The jobs are simple. Union pay rates. The hardest part of the job wasn't the job but peoples attitudes, if you were there for at least the last 10 years or you didn't speak Spanish you were ignored."
King Soopers,19k0l113o5ncobmq,4.0,"I am currently working as an all purpose clerk in the front end, being trained for potential management positions. I have experience checking and working the service desk. I will be trained for bookkeeping. Front end management is somewhat lacking in involvement. The initial training I had was very sloppy and could use some great improvement, but I do understand that the front end department is shorthanded. Overall, I enjoy the company's dedication to its employees, but the store I specifically work at could use some improvements in its upper management."
King Soopers,19jssa3b0ak4o9lr,2.0,"The Deli has the highest turnover of the entire store. After being transferred to that department, I can tell why.The pay was bad, the union and management were jokes, they write up people for calling in sick with whopping cough, wont let their workers go home when they are visibly sick to the public while serving food. Oh, not to mention the weekly union dues that came out of our checks even though we couldn't receive benefits unless we've been with the company for over a year. It seems very high school there. The coworkers (mostly management) don't treat you with any respect unless you've been there over three years seems like. Oh and have a family? Forget about having any free time. You'll be lucky to get two weekends off in six months. There's no flexibility. There were countless times I had to cancel appointments as well, because my manager wouldn't work with me. I often would have to trade shifts with other coworkers, just to see my doctor. This put my health on the back burner as result on several occasions."
King Soopers,19ji67nt7b80pci9,5.0,I learned so much in such a small period of time. The people I worked with will remind me of the good times I had and loved every minute of working for the company.

They don't ever have enough employees in a store to help with the customers and demand. Position I had involved me doing the work equivalent of 10 people in an 8 hour shift. Not only was it stressful, it was miserable. I hated getting up to go to work and often times thought about walking out on the job."

King Soopers,19igce0n31bg12dt,3.0,"After a day at King Soopers you feel stressed!! I learned a lot from them, such as customer service, and Management but its not enough. Management there is different, they all have their favorites and play favorites when it comes to schedules or vacations. I feel every manager should treat everyone equally. My co-workers are the ones I well miss the most. I am a very friendly person who gets along with all of them. The hardest part of my job is having to deal with workers and managers that trash talk about each others, I hate that the most keep it to yourself. The most enjoyable part of my job are my customers, they are awesome and love seeing them."

King Soopers,19ie0dj9sas0ga74,2.0,"The hardest part of the job was having a personal life. They always expected you to show up even on a last minute basis (i.e. 15 mins). The most enjoyable part was money. That's all that mattered at a company like Kroger,"
King Soopers,19idd3nd2as0g93t,5.0,"a typical day at work for me was I never knew what each day had in store for me. What customers I would run in to or what daily activities I had a great management team starting out then as time went on my management dropped the ball as far as responsibility. I learned a lot in my time there, I was operating their cash register and learning to get more out of a work day. My co-workers were friendly and welcoming but there were a few that were less than adequate. The hardest part about my job was trying to go back to work after an injury and do everything as if nothing ever happened. The most enjoyable part was I never knew who I would meet and what walk of life they came from."

King Soopers,19i9ho8eg52sg85k,1.0,I found when I was working at King soopers management play favoritism. In short I think corporate should take a hard long look who they let manage stores.
King Soopers,19hvvjghmas0gac2,2.0,"The store managers harassed employees on a regular basis, only coming out of there office to whine and gripe about how the sales floor looked. Department managers were easy to get along with and often shared the harassment. The co-workers were always easy to talk to. I didn't learn much, other than King Soopers doesn't care about its employees, only sales."
King Soopers,19hc3bpu6ak8g8or,5.0,"With all the departments together and being the marketplace we are, it's hard to not feel part of a big community. This is different than working in a Wal-mart or older King Soopers even, and definitely older than working in a fast food joint, because we do things like have pumpkin carving competitions or celebrate St. Patrick's with a whole bunch of good food in the break room. Their fierceness to make you talk to literally every costumer is annoying at first, but you begin to question why we don't just talk to everyone on the streets and say hello to them when you realize the community it starts to build. We shouldn't have to teach our kids not to talk to strangers; we should work on slowly eliminating the ability to be a stranger. Perhaps that would make those kind of people that hide themselves away from society disappear over time. The idea of talking to everyone also teaches you social skills, and what social acceptability is. You also learn how to be a hard worker, as you'll often be staying overtime finishing everything up if you're not doing front end."

King Soopers,19h3j7074b84gau8,3.0,"King Soopers is a good company, however the management does not care about there employees. You would get yelled at even if you did something right, and often times management would single people out."
King Soopers,19h1i7o2tak4g9hv,3.0,"Not enough people scheduled to get the work done. A great company to work for in theory, but not so much in execution. Employees are stretched too thin, forced to work overtime then criticized for doing so. Management not responsive to employee complaints. A few bad apples allowed to spoil the environment for everyone. Most management is very friendly and wants the best for their workers, but disrespect, abusive conduct, and incompetence is allowed to continue."

King Soopers,19g82pojmas0g9ij,5.0,It was nice to recieve an opportunity to work in a pharmacy. I got to learn the difference between medications and the effects its has on the human body and how to verify a scripts and put them in the data base. The hardest part was definitely dealing with Impatient costumers but I did over come the attitudes and still treated everyone nicely and respectfully. The most enjoyable part of this job was the people who really appreciated all the work you put into putting there scripts together.
King Soopers,19g2qlnd4ak8gfl0,3.0,"I would clock into work, go to my department and get straight to work. When I left King Soopers, I was in the Bakery Department. My duties included but were not limited packaging cookies, pies, and bread. I had to get the Fresh baked french bread ready for 4, 5, and 6. after packaging everything, I would fill up the shelfs. By 6 o' clock, I started closing the department. Cleaning out the donut and danish cases and marking everything down including out of dates. Management was good. They got their jobs done, but I never really saw them. I got along with all of my coworkers, we liked to have fun while getting our work done. There wasn't anything about the job that seemed hard to me. sometimes the oven wouldn't be working properly so the french bread wouldn't get out ontime, but I have no complaints. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. I built relations with my customers and always enjoyed visiting with them for a few minutes."
King Soopers,19fquh563as0g8l5,2.0,"I worked here for over 7 years.  I started when I was a junior in high school just to have a job.  I ended up staying with the company all through college and even a little bit after college.  The only reason that I stayed so long is because of the job security.  At the end of my career at King Soopers, I was making $17.81 per hour, which is pretty decent money for just being a produce clerk.  Department managers make about the same amount and have a lot more stress involved, so it was worth it to me to just work as a produce clerk."

King Soopers,19cmkmr0sak4ge4d,3.0,A typical day would consist of showing up breaking down load off of pallets. Then working the broken down load to the shelves. After that we then would work repack of materials left over from previous days. After completion of this we would put all left over materials back on a U-boat. After all the isles   in the grocery store were thrown we would then condition the materials on the shelves by pulling them forward to make them look full.

My management was also friendly, they really liked me because I would always work more hours if they asked me to. I believe the hardest part of my job was learning all the produce codes, but after a while I got it down. The part i loved the most about my job was my customers, I enjoyed helping them out and it was always nice to see them leave in a good mood."
King Soopers,19c23ghjib84gdqe,3.0,This place isn't for the faint at heart.  They work you like crazy and if you are in the bottom management they work you to death.  Not enough support staff.  Everything is based on seniority so if you haven't been there for ten years you will not get the schedule you want or need.  They don't pay enough.  Hardest part of the job was balancing what the corporate guys wanted with what your store manager wanted.  Most enjoyable part is the people you work with.  There are some amazing people here.  If you can get into a store with a great upper management team you are set but if they are no good you will not be happy.

In both locations I was told I would be great in management and a hard worker, but the total lack of training made it difficult to complete the required process.  I felt that managers did not want to lose a good employee, as a transfer would be required if I did become a manager."

Main store managers like to team up on employees and are rude. Bakery was in a disarray when i was hired and they tried to make so many changes while i was there,it just made it worse. Union reps do not help if you are having issues like i was with the store manager. so you pay union dues with nothing in return... i would work here ever again...."
King Soopers,1988kpnf5ak8g89o,3.0,"A typical day at work is boring and frustrating. The King Soopers location I currently work in is slow most days. There isn't a lot for a front end associate to do if there are no customers. I like to keep busy when I am at a job though this job isn't challenging in the least. I learned that retail is not where I see myself in the future. I'd like to move on from retail and grow not only as a person in society but also a professional. The management at King Soopers is sometimes light and fun, with managers being friendly to customers as well as employees. More often than not though, managers tend to take their frustrations out on the staff. What is most upsetting is the lack of trust between the managers and staff. Barking orders, expecting them to be followed to the letter even when circumstances prevent employees from following through with the task is what can be expected at King Soopers. There is little understanding or compassion among the managers of King Soopers. My co-workers are fine people."

Of course, I ask if they found everything O.K. and begin a light conversation about their plans for the evening or the holidays. I've learned customer service is key for a successful business. By acknowledging the customer and bring them forth first, customers will be more likely to return for another visit. Management is strict. Cells phones are not to be visible during a work shift. Strict rules encourage positive behavior. The toughest part of the job is being stationed in a single position for a very long time. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and getting a good laugh."

Typical days include standing for 8 hours behind a register and taking orders from managers.  I learned how to have patience and understanding for people's situations.  I absolutely loved my co-workers though.  They basically became a second family for me; I met some good people there.  The hardest part of the job was trying not to lose my cool when the managers boss me around like I'm an animal.  Lastly, the most enjoyable part of the job was going home at the end of the day...

After we get the back stock put up, we break down the pallets of new product and put everything up as much as possible. We also get a second truck around 1 am that goes to another department of the store but we unload the pallets and put them in the proper department. We then clean up all the extra product and put them in cart, then put them in the back room while other people clean up all the trash, and boxes off the floors and face all the product.

King Soopers,18qbadqvgak8gdpc,3.0,A typical work day at kingsoopers pharmacy always helping people at the cash register. You have to be able to go between doing two things at once and being as efficient as you can be with out making mistakes. You always have some one to help you if you are not able to help a patient with a claim for insurance. Management always is able to work with my schedule when I need it. I have learned to multi task and be as efficient as i can be. Also to deal with insurance claims that can be a problem. The hardest part of the job is trying to get all of your work done on time especially when you have customers come in and your daily prescription fill is over 500 and your release to patient is over 400 daily. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a patient recognizes you and remembers you and always comments on how good of a worker you are and they remember you by name.

King Soopers,18m0ugupcak4gajk,3.0,"I've learned a lot at Kings. I started at the bottom and have since moved up pretty far. I've worked as a courtesy clerk (bagger), a customer service rep, a cashier, and I've had management training. I've also helped in other departments such as General merchandise, grocery, floral, and produce. I've gotten really good with money handling and understanding that side of the company. I've always been good with typing and keyboards, but working with the registers and computers at the service desk has helped me get better at it. The hardest part, is the inconsistent hours and no set schedules. I am really looking to move on from a job, to a career. I am looking for something that has a set schedule and will allow me 32-40 hours a week. The most enjoyable parts are the people I work with. I've met a lot of great people who have showed me new things and helped me get better at what I do."

As working as King Soopers I have learners a lot throughout these 9 and a half months working here such as Team effort . Stable ability to do my job as given . Be on time every day .

King Soopers,18jg2qnc65ncga55,4.0,"Nice people, hours and pay are challenging. I have learned how to perform every function in a deli, including slicing, chicken cooking, sandwich making and various other job functions.  The managers are great, co-workers are a pleasure to work with.  The hardest part of the job is the hours and relatively low compensation.  The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with the customers.  I enjoy meeting new people and helping them with their purchases."

King Soopers,18it0rrbab84gehh,5.0,"I love this job for so many reasons. There are so many different people to interact with and you build great relationships with these people that you end up taking care of. You spend so much time with them you become very attached to them. Also you can make your own schedule to better fit around the things you have to do like if you are in school you can work around your school schedule. Plus since you make your own schedule and control how many patients you have, it's a good job to have even if you only work a few days a week for some extra money. Great people, unforgettable experience."
King Soopers,18it0iv0tak8gcqi,4.0,"working at King Soopers has taught me to communicate with people better, learn to effectively deal with bad situations without making them worst and instead making them better. Also it taught that you can effectively get work done and also have fun too. I loved all the people I worked with, it's a nice atmosphere to be in and they're constantly doing things to make sure the whole store is interacting with each other such as spirit week where we don't wear our uniforms that week and every day is a different theme, All in all, it's a good company and great experience. I highly recommend it."
King Soopers,18ipbfc5ab84gd1l,3.0,"A day at work is like any other day, to the point they actually begin to blur together, the hours ensure you have little social interaction, even with your coworkers. management is severely lacking opting to encourage you to move fast and accurately by telling you to rather than actually contributing as strategy that may improve work habits. getting out on time was an achievement which was somewhat of a disappointment."
King Soopers,18i7g3odmb84g91m,1.0,"I liked King Soopers at first but I quickly realized that it was not as stable of a work environment as I thought. I had no real job security and several of my coworkers were lazy and others had to pick up on their slack. I was constantly between two different positions and did not have steady hours. I would have 40 hours one week and 20 for the next two. I had to pay union fees which reduced my pay significantly and I was unable to pay for a lot of necessities. Drama is at the core of some of the King Soopers locations. As long as you do not allow yourself to be dragged in, you will remain out of the spotlight. Management seems to be a problem as some of the people given these positions only get them out of seniority (one of the disappointing parts about being part of a union. Advancement is not based on your ability to do the job.) While I worked in the floral department, I did enjoy helping customers with their needs and doing manual labor, ensuring everything was stocked, cleaned, and looking attractive. It was a fairly easy job but probably better for those who do not to rely on it unless you can get a contract for full time. They are VERY stingy with overtime hours and strict about clocking in and out. Remember to save the number for the union and call them instead of union resources if you have any problems. Human resources claims to be confidential but I have seen a few cases where the names of callers are revealed and they have been written up for calling."

King Soopers,18heknjhgb84gcn4,2.0,"King soopers is where you should always shop. Prices are great and you always know where to look for stuff. Bad part is starting low but never getting a promotion.

King Soopers,18h6abro75n8g9me,2.0,Helping people was good but the management staff was rude and inconsiderate.
King Soopers,18h4dgo96ak8gat1,1.0,"After working for them for 8+ years I was terminated for ""poor job performance"".

I also learned how to keep a smile on my face even if i was having a bad day or a rude customer. my co-workers were really nice and easy to talk to many of my co-workers became friends. The hardest part of the job was keeping a good attitude throughout the day no matter what the circumstances of your day were. the most enjoyable part of the job was to make people happy and laugh and having people tell me that my smile brightened their day.

I generally keep myself busy even during down time from keeping my work station neat and organized to helping out in other departments when needed. I usually learn something new everyday whether its something a customer is expressing to me or something new in the store like sales or policies. The management at my work is great and is always there to help when in need. My co-workers are amazing and are a great helping hand as we are team players. The hardest part of my job is when we are short staffed and customers end up waiting for service, depending on how busy the store gets. The most enjoyable part of my job is customer satisfaction. I enjoy being apart of that satisfaction knowing that I was able to help a customer from their concerns to their needs."

King Soopers,187bvlnvkb84gcv3,4.0,A typical day at work would usually be slow towards the end of the day and the rushes that come in after school gets out. What I learned from King Soopers is inventory management I learned how to order some product for the next day and how to get ready for any product that was on sale. Management was fun my assistant manager was the only one that I worked with but he helped me learn better about the job and taught me how to break down the truck faster. Co-workers were a bit slow and liked to talk with the customers a lot instead of actually working. The hardest part of the day is if the truck came in late because you couldn't break down the truck you just had to grab the product that was empty or low out on the sales floor and put the cold product in the cooler. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my assistant manager because he liked trying to work as fast as possible to try to get out there early and a lot of the time we got out about 30 minutes to and hour early
King Soopers,1871ejg8c5ncgakk,5.0,I loved being the Photo Manager at King Soopers.  It was heartbreaking when I found out they were discontinuing Photo at all Kroger stores. I went from full time Photo Manager (a job I loved) to part time checker.  I did not lose my pay so that was nice and I had a lot of friends that worked there and I loved the customers. I helped out in all of the departments when they needed it so I was kept busy. The hardest part of that job was obviously losing the photo lab and the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact with all the customers.

When it would come to breaks and lunches I would have to wait for management to give me the okay to go. The main part of all of those jobs were to make sure that I provided good customer service. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with customers that didn't exactly see it my way. The best part of the job though was getting to work around all of the new people. In this job I learned how to handle money and how to use customer service skills."

As long as you can be flexible and you dont mind dedicating your time to the company and you are loyal the possibilities of advancement are limitless. Working with the public was a bonus for me so if you dont like people this is not the job for you.  I always found the managers to be supportive of me, not everyone will say the same.  The hardest part of the job are the hours and the fact that you kind of have to be married to King Soopers at times and missing holidays with family is hard but that what retail is."

Its a lot going on all the time, it starts to get to you and your workers. Mangers have mood swing like no other and take them out on you with having attitudes and smart talking you. They pay should be more for courtesy clerks cause without them the store wouldn't be possible. The customers are really nice and you get to build a relationship with them. Make sure you do your work.
