KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1f7kh66g5u3hk800,5.0,"Excelente empresa, muy profesional, muy buenas capacitaciones, muy buen ambiente, los salarios se hacen competitivos con el tiempo, pero hay que tener paciencia para alacanzarlos."
KPMG,1f7hlk64mu2ud800,2.0,Worked as a technical support specialist/Help desk technician st the NSC in St.Louis.  I was a contractor and worked there for about 6 months. I was told I would be hired on as a full time employee after 3 months but it was quickly apparent that that was not the case. Several other contractors had been working there for over a year and still had not been converted to full time employees with benefits. It seems crazy to work for a company for a year plus and not have decent benefits or pto because you’re a contractor. And it became pretty clear that I would be in that position for a while.
KPMG,1f7dc94op3kis000,5.0,"Great place to work and to start your career. A lot of pressure as usual in a Big 4 consulting firm. Little work/life balance, but at least the salary is decent."
KPMG,1f797ovhgu2ud800,4.0,"Great place to start your career at. But staying long term is not for everyone. There are tons of learning opportunities and if you are a go-getter and high-achiever (and can work A LOT), you will do great here. The work can be a bit too demanding and stressful for some, though."
KPMG,1f6pujkcn3obs000,4.0,"KPMG has been a great place for me to start my career. The management teams here have ensured that I am learning various skills that I receive exposure to many different clients and industries for my benefit. The company is extremely flexible when working to make sure that you are pursing the goals that you would like within the bounds of the jobs. There are times when I feel like I am being asked to, or are actively engaging in projects that call for more experience. In those cases I feel like I am being under compensated as I am doing work at a higher level than what I am being paid to do."
KPMG,1f6oggblis7es800,4.0,If you are willing to learn and grow then this is the company for you.  There are many opportunities to excel. It’s essential to be able to multitask as you will have many projects.  There will never be a dull day.
KPMG,1f6n342bdt5qv800,4.0,Job security. Flexibility ....Nationally standing up for inequalities...Great Perks...Decent Pay...Management needs to broaden their perspective. Advancement is very hard ..All remote position post covid
KPMG,1f675a7pg3ocs000,1.0,Was told the job was going to be for a minimum of a year.  Was cut loose just after 8 months.  I was banking on that last four months of employment.  I had multiple on going issues with payroll.  Not deducting taxes from check correctly.  Overall this is the worst place I have ever worked.  Would never take another position here if offered one again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
KPMG,1f61acl80s7lk800,5.0,Experience worth having. Every team is managed a bit differently. The culture is very strong and there’s a sense of belonging. The stress level is quite high through
KPMG,1f5ofabuosa39800,3.0,Not worth it. Long hours. Highly stressed environment once you’re promoted to senior. High performance culture. Typical political big 4 environment. Lots of networking events
KPMG,1f5mi53cgsaai800,4.0,"My position was in-house, examining and accounting for the US consulting operations, lots of hours of course, lots of humility needed as learning curve is steep, if you stick to it you’ll be amazed at your professional growth"
KPMG,1f5jl8g4eu2n1800,5.0,KPMG is a great place to work for professionals that are go getters and can succeed with little supervision. The firm enables you to grow as a person and professional in the same time. Everybody that I know is very friendly and willing to help.
KPMG,1f5j0dqnvu2n1800,3.0,A great job depending on your manager.
KPMG,1f5hfe8dl308d000,4.0,"I enjoyed my time working at KPMG. Such nice colleagues and a great atmosphere to work in. KPMG Culture is second to none. It's all about inclusion and welcoming of diversity. The benefits are great. They want you to be healthy and give you time for that daily. The overall attitude of KPMG's upper management gives you the feeling they actually DO care about their employees first and foremost. It is the best company I have worked for, by far, when it comes to how you're treated."
KPMG,1f5a58miusaai800,4.0,"Stressful job with a significant hour requirement during busy season. But good experience, you will learn a lot and you will have lots of opportunity to grow in your career."
KPMG,1f56lk06mo1kn800,3.0,Long hours (obviously). Decent bennies. Good place to start your career. Get that big 4 stamp on the resume. Can lead to better opportunities in industry.
KPMG,1f563edv0saai800,3.0,"Typical Big 4 experience. Eager high achievers getting overworked and underpaid. Busy season is not a season, you stay in overtime most of the year. Learned a lot but until the partners and MDs retire and a younger management group is promoted there doesn’t seem to be much changing in the toxic overwork environment. Minimal work life balance but hours flexibility is nice."
KPMG,1f542c75ou3af800,5.0,"I worked here only for a few weeks, but it is obvious that this is an excellent company.  I can't say enough what a great company this is and I highly recommend it.  I was working from home.  They sent me a laptop and all the equipment I needed to work.  The benefits are amazing.  The company culture is amazing.  The people are amazing.  The pay is amazing.  Work here and you are set for life."
KPMG,1f51e8ltp308d000,3.0,"Not sure why management feels the need to carry on the charade of big 4 work/life balance. It is a bad joke. Its all meant to seem like you are an important part of the company/team but if that was the case, they should treat you way better. Do your time, and once you find an exit opp, take it."
KPMG,1f4sik13iu39f800,1.0,"Would not recommend to anyone. If you weren’t part of the clique you weren’t accepted. Management were always calling, watching and checking up on you. When you’d ask for work you were told they didn’t have anything but in reviews you were punished for not doing enough work."
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1f4r9n071sa8r800,3.0,The pay was the first thing that attracted me to the job. I did not get a return offer after my internshio landed because I was not good at interacting.
KPMG,1f4nr1cm5u392800,5.0,"I enjoyed my time at KPMG and think it is an excellent place to begin a career in the accounting field. The management is very supportive and there is a lot of training to make sure you're up to date. In public accounting, you learn nearly every day, however some of the work is quite tedious."
KPMG,1f4gbaap72v6h000,3.0,"KPMG was definitely a journey. It seems like the management didn't really care what kind of projects that they took on and what that meant for employees. However, I learned more than I could have imagined, worked with some really smart people, and the benefits are great. You also get a chance to work with other large companies."
KPMG,1f4ci4v9bu39f800,3.0,You should know what to expect going in most likely.  Figure out what you want to get out of the experience going in and it will make it more bearable.
KPMG,1f4b0d749u392800,2.0,"I mean, it's Big 4. At the staff level, the biggest attractions to get in are the possible exit opportunities when you get out. If those opportunities don't show up, then really, it's just a big white-collar factory. But for some people it works out staying in so good for them."
KPMG,1f4a4gns6u392800,5.0,"I loved it, always felt good there, people where usually proactive, they provided resources to help employees continue to grow to help their clients achieve their goals, good team environment.  The building was beautiful.  Client locations where also amazing."
KPMG,1f4993bhs2v72000,5.0,I am so happy to be part of the team. They always make sure that you are learning and enjoying and that means so much to them. This internship is fruitful.
KPMG,1f40bbnvanpjm800,5.0,All us secretaries and admin always took care of each other and fill in when needed.  Always celebrated all of our birthdays by going out to nice lunches at Houstons!!  Loved my time at KPMG and miss all my co-workers :)
KPMG,1f3taen5vs7ju800,3.0,I enjoyed my time at KPMG and think it is an excellent place to begin a career in the accounting field. The management is very supportive and there is a lot of training to make sure you're up to date.
KPMG,1f3m37tj5o29g800,3.0,"In public accounting, you learn nearly every day, however some of the work is quite tedious. The hours during busy season are typically quite intense and will require you to place you personal life on hold. Granted this is just the deal with public accounting and is not unique to KPMG. Wages are standard for public accounting but are low compared to industry positions, especially when total hours are factored in."
KPMG,1f3lqs0cjo29g800,4.0,"KPMG actually values their employees, though your management, compensation, and advancement do not actively reflect it. KPMG has 2 yearly shutdowns, one over Christmas, and the other over 4th of July for a paid week that doesn't count against your vacation time. Surprisingly weak on the benefits and pay side, it is a fun company to work at."
KPMG,1f3c9kjsmu3bc800,3.0,"There are plenty of opportunities to learn and advance in your career. Opportunities are boundless, but be prepared to work 50 hours every week. Things pop up often and management treats everything like a fire drill. Management bends to clients needs without thinking of the strain it puts on their employees."
KPMG,1f3bi9b4ju3bc800,4.0,KPMG feels like a family from the very beginning. Everyone is welcoming and willing to help you succeed whether you've been there for a month or for 20 years.
KPMG,1f2q0hnbj3ki8000,3.0,"KPMG doesn't have a very strong culture and limited opportunities to grow. Projects are not assigned based on skillset, and advancement in career is slow."
KPMG,1f2j0u7q8309g000,4.0,"Work life balance is practically non-existent, especially since transitioning to work from home. At this point, basically just trying to hang in there to get enough experience and leave as soon as possible just like most people."
KPMG,1f2cdvv623ki8000,4.0,Working in KPMG’s Deal Advisory space a can be fun and challenging. It all depends on the mindset with with you approach the task. The hours can be tough significantly impacting work life balance but if you have an awesome team you’ll very rarely feel it.
KPMG,1f2a7eua3him2800,4.0,All the staff and managers where great but busy season sucked working 60-100 hrs per week and lots of travel. Tons of company happy hrs and events. Great place to start a career and give you the upper-hand when applying to another job.
KPMG,1f24904oos798800,3.0,It’s a great place to start a career. Really enjoyed my peer group. The work/life balance does not exist. Definitely not compensated for the amount of overtime provided and very little flexibility.
KPMG,1f23qblf9u1v3800,2.0,KPMG is a meat grinder.   The 12 years I worked for them I never say one person retire.   The company gets rid of its aging workforce before they get a chance to retire with full benefits.    One of the worst companies I've ever been associated with.  While there I saw every person hired on with me let go through the years.  By the time the company forced early retirement on me at the age of 57 after 12 years of dedicated service everyone I knew at the company had be let go.   Not a secure place to work for long-term life planning.
KPMG,1f1ts5mfat4cq800,4.0,"The work can vary from fairly interesting to pretty mundane, but the thing that makes KPMG what it is are the people. That is definitely the best part about working here. Besides that, it is a high stress environment with long hours. Management does try to recognize performance though."
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1f1q1scjbu40q800,4.0,Audit is audit buts it’s the best of the B4 in my opinion.  Career coaches are usually very helpful and care about your growth.
KPMG,1f1o5jt25u40q800,3.0,"Long hours and work life balance is not always great. Schedule can change week to week/month to month due to nature of job. Didn't really have any say about what project you get placed on which isn't always great if you get stuck on a client engagement you don't enjoy. Good benefits and company perks, but pay should have been more compared to industry. People are frequently overworked and burnt out. Trainings were fun and learned a lot, especially when new. Great people - made some great friends. You do learn a ton though because you're forced to so it is a great way to quickly advance your career. There is high turnover at a lot of Big 4 companies."
KPMG,1f1k0o1fonph7800,5.0,"Working at KPMG was one of the most positive experiences I've had in my professional career. There was an open door policy between staff and management within my team, and the full-time KPMG workers. There didn't seem to be a hierchy among high skilled workers. Everyone maintained a culture of respect and inclusion. This was an amazing place to work."
KPMG,1f1eduppkt4q6800,5.0,Fun times with initial manager but not so happy with subsequent manager. Learn alot work hard to meet engagement deliverables and quality work products
KPMG,1f11jpmeqn53l800,2.0,Start your career there but get out quickly. Management recycle employees like water bottles.
KPMG,1f10bhbucs7jc800,1.0,"Didn't like my time in there, was a waste of time, bad management and a lot of ""you should know you could have done this"" when nobody explains anything to you"
KPMG,1f0tqrqpan54g800,4.0,Great place to start a career. Supportive environment which supplies the resources needed to learn and grow a career. So many opportunities especially for those that are driven.
KPMG,1f0i77rbanpl8800,3.0,"I'm just a intern in KPMG, but my co-worker(or supervisor) told me that they have to work very late so as to complete their assigned jobs. And the payment was just not pleasant."
KPMG,1f07k4o9du3jt800,3.0,"Great people to work with in most of the teams i have been on, stable job with predictable advancement from assoc to senior to manager to senior manager, but overall too many hours and not enough pay"
KPMG,1f03rvtfmu3jt800,4.0,Long hours and not compensated accordingly. However people are great to work with and learning at such a high pace. Great training is made available to all employees
KPMG,1evshiv1an52h800,4.0,Great place to get trained and build your career - tough hours but the trade off is worth it. Recommend you stay until senior associate at a minimum.
KPMG,1evq04tkfsa8h800,4.0,Really productive work environment. Hours can be long but only expected. Management listen to your concerns and make allowances if you ever need them.
KPMG,1evg5j6tnocao800,5.0,Great company to launchpad your company. There are numerous opportunities you can dive into or transfer into once you're in. Just do your part in selling yourself well.
KPMG,1euvna1b3npjs800,4.0,"Overall, a great place to be if you want your career to accelerate in high gear. That said, hours can be long, travel can be intense, and the advancement opportunities do create a competitive environment ."
KPMG,1euraptfs3h99000,2.0,"Management consulting not in focus, hence little motivation to work there, as silos mentality creates road blocker in own development within the consulting department."
KPMG,1eumregumo1i6800,2.0,"Despite National being very pro mental health and inclusive, I found the local office to be quite the opposite.  I have never been treated so poorly by a professional then I was at KPMG. My direct manager was unavailable and unwilling to listen or appreciate mental health concerns. No support offered which is really disappointing for the level of company.  Just a number not a person."
KPMG,1euj690kjo15p800,5.0,This is the typical big 4 experience. Long hours but worth your while at the beginning of your career.  You will learn a lot but you will get exhausted.
KPMG,1eub4f7353h8h000,1.0,"The firm does not have the Ability to execute a meaningful direction and strategy.  No sense of team or market leadership.  Partners have no interest in driving the business , only how will the be bonused each year."
KPMG,1eu3j2pgmn5b4800,3.0,A lot of time consuming tasks - normally performed by offshore teams
KPMG,1eu178r143kh5000,3.0,I enjoyed my time there. Many nice coworkers the work was efficient but the management team I did not care for. With the team I worked with they were for themselves and made it seem like they didn’t want to help and were annoyed easily
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1ettha6tiu312800,4.0,Interning for this company was interesting it was all online so it was tough to pick up information especially when unsure of everything going on in the first place
KPMG,1etnhbburosn9800,3.0,"The role has its benefits in terms of advancement, flexible hours during the offseason and benefits. However, the compensation is very rigid in terms of not differentiating for performance, as you can expect with a large corporation. It's hit and miss in terms of the how supportive your managers and partners can be."
KPMG,1et7bbisct52l800,4.0,I’ve been here 5 years now. It’s a great company no complaints. Pay is good and the work is interesting. Would recommend working here to others. The leadership is solid.
KPMG,1et3r9pbcpi26800,3.0,"Had fun as a recent undergrad and felt invested in. However, travel and unpredictable schedule was not sustainable.  Nonetheless, I learned a lot and enjoyed my time there."
KPMG,1eshc3u82s9uq800,4.0,"I really enjoy the jobs I am placed on and the people I work with. I think the firm does a good job advancing inclusion & diversity programs. One downfall is that I don’t feel compensated for the level of effort I put in, but they’re in the process of changing the way reviews are completed so I’m hopeful it’ll change."
KPMG,1es17nqodnplu800,3.0,This company gives you the opportunity to excel and grow depending on your position level. More potentials for staff level management than it is for admin assistants unless you have a 4-year degree and want to move into a staffing position.
KPMG,1erf7rkfasa99800,4.0,"Upper management is unrealistic and does not care for lower level employees, middle management is good but the great ones leave to go elsewhere, under paid for big 4."
KPMG,1ercbcae4sa99800,5.0,"Great people, easy commute, beautiful office.  Lots of perks. Volunteer time off which you are given many choices. Also free coffee and milk supplied by the office."
KPMG,1er7ulq2psa97800,3.0,Dogs are the best thing going for the company they are very fun and make the workplace much better to be in and make me want to come in everyday and never call out
KPMG,1eqmqpfuko2gt800,4.0,"Working hard from associate to senior to manager. There is a classic path to partner or you can hop out like so many do after a few years. Big clients, large engagements. Fast paced. Low pay for the hours."
KPMG,1eqlq6237u35m800,5.0,"Lots of training. Busy, fast paced atmosphere. Great diverse workplace where everyone was welcome. Sorry to leave there but I was laid off due to a COVID reduction in workforce."
KPMG,1eqif8ioqu49m800,1.0,"The firm has excellent benefits, but the culture is something to desire.  If you are not an Associate or above, you will not have a voice and often left out.  They speak on Inclusion and Diversity, but the numbers does not show that.  If you are a minority your chances on succeeding are slim to none.  Please take heed to this advice and do your due diligence before applying or accepting a job with this firm."
KPMG,1eq0dsehdu35m800,4.0,"Performance driven culture. Co workers are very supportive. Many opportunities to learn and good supportive managers and employees are very focused on their work. Since this is accounting, many employees work long hard hours during busy season but the company rewards well. The Short Hills office was a close-knit work culture."
KPMG,1eppqd4ngu35m800,2.0,Nothing special. No raise or bonus. Not much growth while working at this company. Not much support from management either. My team does have the ability to work from home which is nice.
KPMG,1epkide5ou23q800,1.0,"Good place to start great time family at work feel as home learn alot on the job , professional team members great benefits . alot of work , great bonus,"
KPMG,1epjpelc3u2nb800,3.0,"I would rate them 5 out of 5 for shelling out professionals. It’s like a production line. They pay good money to train you into a problem-killing machine. BUT in my humble opinion, it’s not worth the toll on your mental health. They’ll put a straw in you, and suck the life out of you, checking to make certain you’re not dead as they do so. Colleague died and got a minute of silence. We continued typing as we stood in “silence”. I quit, met all conditions, but the final emoluments never came. Don’t do it!"
KPMG,1epalcf7mu32a800,3.0,"Your experience will entirely depend on your engagement and/or team. You can be put on an absolute dumpster fire of a project and have a dreadful experience, or you can get put on an excellent project and end up wondering why some of your peers are so stressed and contemplating jumping off a bridge. I was fortunate to be put on a great project and have had an excellent experience thus far. Oth I have heard a couple of my fellow new hires have been put on terrible projects and I genuinely feel bad for them. The concerns i’ve heard are incompetent managers, Senior Associate with little to no accountability for the success of their new associates, and unusually long hours. Overall my experience has been a super positive one."
KPMG,1ep1ljlh0s7m1800,3.0,"Pros: Diversity, Technology, can work remote, health benefits + pto (day after thanksgiving off + closed christmas week), everyone at every level is issued a firm laptop"
KPMG,1eovd7lves7m1800,3.0,"1) Most days are very busy as you scale up in the organization and involve many hours of calls, work, review and deliverables."
KPMG,1eog558venpgr800,2.0,everything in the company needs to be changed. Management does not give room for people to grow and will not allow their careers to process to the level that they can.
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1eodd3glms78u800,2.0,KPMG treats anyone under an associate level like they are easily replaceable. There is no office culture or rapport and dedicated staff are severely underpaid. It is nearly impossible to get a promotion or hired for an internal position. I do not recommend this company to anyone who is under the associate level.
KPMG,1eo35lcdtt4kh800,2.0,Blame game
KPMG,1ent00i23npn0800,4.0,Love this company. it is a wonderful place to work and everyone work as a team in the company. I truly enjoy working there. I can get time off easily and get paid well for my job.
KPMG,1enqrovjlu1tu800,2.0,"KPMG Canada is supposed to be in the ''Big 4'' but is really running behind on others, they should really not be considered in the Big 4. Their audit technology is super old, their tools are not up to date and they have a real hard time doing the transition."
KPMG,1enlr73s2saas800,4.0,Best place to work so you learn and move on..you will have clients in different industries so you will get to know about how these companies are managed.That is a good advantage
KPMG,1enlcukehu2d6800,5.0,Work-life balance
KPMG,1enf1utncnpln800,5.0,"As an employee at KPMG you will have access to and interact with experts across industries and business solutions. At the same time you will be valued for the skills and expertise you bring to the table. It is truly a collaborative environment. KPMG also puts tremendous effort in curating a positive and balanced culture. The culture message is extremely well thought out and executed. Overall, a great place to work and learn."
KPMG,1enep3hdenpt1800,1.0,Satisfaction goes with what client you get put on and what partner you work for... Your partner can change the whole dynamic of the workplace - every engagement can act as it's own small entity.
KPMG,1en9ocmi2u1av800,5.0,Unlimited advancement opportunities
KPMG,1en8tocbes9u3800,5.0,KPMG's a great place to begin a career. You build a solid network and there is training for all analysts with regular social events. The culture has slightly deteriorated due to good people leaving but overall a good experience.
KPMG,1en2hv6ant51g800,2.0,"Toxic, toxic, toxic!  The people were nice but I could do without the brown-nosing and phony clique's. There's much better places to work with much better leadership and pay."
KPMG,1en0rrcd1o1no800,4.0,"pretty boring at times bc tasks can be very tedious, but it is a good place to gain accounting exp. having good co-workers really changes the atm so be on the look out for that"
KPMG,1emq69qclnptv800,5.0,You’re going to work a lot but having KPMG on your resume will set you for life in the world of corporate accounting.
KPMG,1eme6ee0inpup800,4.0,I was an auditor in Los Angeles and I did a lot of work with my team. It was very stressful and didn’t know what to do next. New staff theres a lot to do and hard
KPMG,1eluihmino16r800,5.0,The work life balance is great and there are always someone out there to guide you and lead you. Pay is good. Good career opportunities with competitive benefits.
KPMG,1elsuven1u2u5800,5.0,"At KPMG, be expected to work long hours.  In Hartford, CT, it seems to be on the upper spectrum of hours worked compared to other BIG 4 (EY might be worse).  If you are a decent performer, expect to be promoted on time, within 4.5 years you can be a manager making 100K - quick advancement and pretty common.  Learn quickly on the job."
KPMG,1elq49ea8u2u5800,4.0,KPMG is a great place to start your career.  Amazing opportunities.  Additionally they offer great training to get to get you started.  Managers are great.
KPMG,1eliruvl4npcn800,4.0,"Great company that cares about its interns. As an intern, you get exposed to different industries. I was rotated between three different clients in different industries."
KPMG,1elbahdceu1cn800,5.0,I loved working for KPMG! I started entry level and stayed for 3 years. I left because I felt that I wasn't seen as more then this entry level role and didn't feel I would be able to move to different departments and excel. I did make a lateral move to the NYC office and I REALLY liked the job but just wasn't making enough money.  So I sadly left to get more experience elsewhere. I do wish there was more opportunity to move and be seen even though I had such an entry level support role.
KPMG,1el9tlc17s7ic800,5.0,Work-life balance
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1el496akdu1qi800,4.0,"KPMG is an amazing place to begin your career, extremely supporting company depending on the service, only qualm would be the pay. but you get the chance to work on various projects which definitely aids your growth"
KPMG,1ekvau9krnph9800,2.0,"It is a great place to learn, but managers does not appreciatte your sacrifices. Poor staff organization and no coordination. Salary is not enough for all the hours you work."
KPMG,1ekjpk39pu1t7800,5.0,"It is a public accounting firm, so there is inherent dissatisfaction. Beyond that, KPMG was a great place to work. I enjoyed my coworkers and a good majority of management."
KPMG,1ekf2q6l13o7v000,4.0,"At least in my area of expertise and within my team, I felt I had plenty of exposure to a variety of different kinds of work under different managers. I think this is a great thing for entry level workers who may not know exactly what they want to do with their careers. Longer run, in consulting you need to become more specialized to stay in, but for a first job out of college I would recommend KPMG. However, the culture of each team and line of business can vary greatly, which one should also keep in mind."
KPMG,1ek70a950u3t5800,4.0,Almost 15 years with KPMG and with this virus stuff continuing they had to make some hard choices and I was one of them otherwise I would still be working there.
KPMG,1ek25j6sp3o71000,4.0,People are great to work with.  Business margin pressures lead to lot of cost cutting and restricting.  Senior management changes every 5 years so changes are always occurring for both good and bad.
KPMG,1ejvtgv5ou3cj800,4.0,"KPMG is proud to be a diverse professional firm.  I worked with some great people and served clients in a number of industries.  Because of some specialized knowledge, I was able to work on special project outside of my region."
KPMG,1ejtqjtirnpdo800,4.0,"It is great place to start your career, but you must remember you can be placed on multiple busy seasons back to back. Once that occurs it's easy  to realize how underpaid the staff is."
KPMG,1ejtfa80ss78h800,4.0,I had a really great internship experience at KPMG! The managers were really supportive as well as the associates I worked with in ensuring that I understood the work that I was doing.
KPMG,1ejlbd1fku1l6800,1.0,"I started off with the firm on an outstanding note for about a year (despite lack of pay for grueling work and exhausting hours and utter disregard for work / life balance).  When I transitioned to a new engagement, I received next to no training for my position.  This set me up for failure immediately, especially as a recent graduate just beginning my career.  I was told repeatedly by colleagues that I did not belong with KPMG because I didn't major in business or accounting. Due to frequent questioning and doubts as to why I'm apart of the firm, I struggled feeling a sense of belonging.  My manager was very unprofessional, who micromanaged and forwarded me emails containing catty, negative discussions between other colleagues about me."
KPMG,1ejiccdels7hg800,5.0,Great place to work with an office hoteling concept. The firm is very responsive to the employees work/life needs and the salary is great. I highly recommend KPMG as one of the best places I have worked.
KPMG,1eje03g3tu3pg800,3.0,This job stressed me. I worked very long hours and with little recognition for it. It’s great that they pay for meals and transportation but they work you very hard for not as nearly the same amount in pay.
KPMG,1ej182rdusqbl800,5.0,great company with amazing benefits...i wish i never lost the job smh. i reall missed working there. ppl are nice and they have the best HR who protect their employees.
KPMG,1eip7ib9gsqbl800,3.0,"You are expected to put in 50-60 hours per week, including weekends. You expect to have to put in extra time on occasion to deal with a schedule issue or an emergency. They do not add staff when there is too much work, they expect you to take the time out of your personal life to fill in the gaps."
KPMG,1eiodles1sqbl800,5.0,- KPMG does Agile development which works great for their team dynamic.
KPMG,1eilsa54qsqbl800,4.0,It's just like they tell you.
KPMG,1eijkaj24olck800,4.0,I wish I could have continued to work with kpmg. I have got good exposure till the time I work with. Good place to work. I feel Kpmg cares employees like a baby.
KPMG,1eihdafqqof3u800,1.0,"Nothing was good, absolutely hated this company. Too much work, seniors who were cut throat and would literally curse at you, favoritism, lack of diversity, too many Type A personalities. Run!!!"
KPMG,1eifgq4npsqbl800,5.0,Overall
KPMG,1eifci1a1sqbl800,4.0,Good benefits
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1eid8fpmsree1800,5.0,A great place to work. Colleagues are bright. Managers are held to a high bar for values. I would recommend. They are people-focused and care about employees.
KPMG,1eicpb6qtof3u800,3.0,"I learned a lot of relevant information however it came at the cost of long hours during busy season (i.e., 70+ hours) and continuous stress. Seems to be a place where you fall in line rather than be yourself."
KPMG,1eia7bk60of3u800,3.0,This place will make you feel like your career is at the forefront for learning and growing which is great. The only sacrifice is that you have no work-personal life balance.
KPMG,1ei9ped1iu1dj800,5.0,I have no complaints over starting my career at KPMG. I lasted three years until a senior auditor and left to pursue internal audit knowing the skills I took with me would be valuable.
KPMG,1ei9lj3jusqbl800,4.0,Great culture and environment.  People are very kind on all levels up to management. Long hours and heavy deadlines but communications is great during this time and multiple opportunities.
KPMG,1ehqc7krnro7r800,3.0,I worked at KPMG full-time for more than 10 years
KPMG,1egp1tvje3cfd000,2.0,"Busy season lasted about 6/7 months as I was tossed from one busy season client to the next. The most hours I worked in a week was 80 hours, which was awful. Managers expect you to put work first without saying it out right. Pay and bonuses are less than I thought they would be."
KPMG,1efjb6oeaol7u800,3.0,- Good PTO plan
KPMG,1efgr0299oetj800,1.0,Plan on performing repetitive tasks ad nauseam for years on  end.  Incompetent management only out to save themselves.  Many co-workers are not trustworthy.  Not a good place to work unless you hate life.
KPMG,1ef0383hercmp800,4.0,The pay was good even when coronavirus pay cuts occurred. My coworkers were pretty cool I just didn't like my boss. The director of security needs to be replaced. He literally drains the life out of the company. Other than that great company fair pay.
KPMG,1eenulfa7r4sg800,3.0,KPMG is a great place to start your career. It’s a huge resume builder and every day is different. There are many opportunities to learn and grow. Unfortunately there’s no work life balance and you may have to juggle multiple clients at once. There are also so many new required work papers within the last year but you don’t get any more time allocated to complete these. Jobs can be very understaffed as well.
KPMG,1eedkvtjppjmm800,4.0,Kpmg is a great place to start a career and advance quickly. The skills you develop are useful in any future role.  The environment is fast paced and client service driven.
KPMG,1edu7ii97s37k800,5.0,"The culture and ambient are great at KPMG, the workload is heavy but you get support from your peers. If you work as a project manager there will be tremendous amount of overtime and pressure to deliver; on the positive side, if you are an employee you get paid furlough  twice a year, last week and first week in January and two weeks in July."
KPMG,1edng6g73oe0j801,4.0,"The people that you work with on a project will make or break your experience at the firm. The firm keeps cutting down employee benefits during difficult times, but never increase them back afterwards. Job security is pretty good though."
KPMG,1ed811ba2osed800,4.0,This was the second time in the past several years that they have laid off employees due to outsourcing to India  and Mexico.  The job growth isn't at par with other companies.
KPMG,1ed7ti9f2pvi3800,5.0,The work environment is full of opportunities in various Accounting fields.Lots of trainings are provided for employees.It a safe working environment.
KPMG,1ed759b2are1l800,5.0,"You have feeling work-life balance. Great environment with well skilled work team. Good salary, and compensation. People work at KPMG for yrs and even retire."
KPMG,1eciu34imoear800,1.0,"If you value your career, and understand your career is short and experience is valuable, don’t waste the years where you could and should be working with competent management"
KPMG,1ebuguh7kpc6g800,4.0,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at KPMG. However, this was mainly because of the greatest coworkers and perks given. It truly felt like family. KPMG had many loyal coworkers who were passionate, optimistic, and inclusive. KPMG allows a great employee experience. Benefits and perks are ideal. The one downside to KPMG was the lack of management. Some PMLs need more mandatory, formal trainings. They are not flexible as far as work life balance, there is evident micro-managing, and many employees will attest that it is challenging to get promoted even when demonstrating results and excellent performance. It's discouraging especially for the younger employees and associates who came in at an already low salary and are eager to learn more and grow. If things don't change, the new or younger employees will not remain loyal. If management and leadership really focus on career development and flexibility, KPMG would be perfect. Hoping to return to KPMG one day with more experience and help make an impact!"
KPMG,1ebf0qf0crg9n800,2.0,Blame game
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1e9mnp1u0qvcq800,3.0,"The people who work at KPMG are great to work for and with, the work itself is typical audit work for large clients. You learn a lot but are underpaid and overworked."
KPMG,1e9459tjr3046000,5.0,"A very friendly staff with a great environment, a place like you want to say I’m home, very good schedule and pay. A great place to work for ever. Good people with always smile to help you whenever you need"
KPMG,1e8teosmh4tq1800,5.0,"My team at KPMG were total pros - colleagues who combined mastery of their subject matter with high social intelligence and collegiality.  I was pushed hard at KPMG but never overtly.  Rather, the incentive to strive was to keep up with the hard working and very intelligent colleagues and contribute to team success."
KPMG,1e8pmoss2oaig800,2.0,You must love what you do otherwise you will burn out quickly.  Busy season can be very stressful and often times personalities clash due to high demands and low guidance/direction from management.
KPMG,1e8mmhicjotfn800,4.0,"Overall, I had a good time working with KPMG. The culture is amazing, the employee and manager collaboration and support is very strong. There is definitely favoritism played toward Audit/Tax/Advisory"
KPMG,1e8j342vlnofa800,5.0,"Great company to work for many reasons. You get the experience of working in various business environments. The a manager assigns you to various audits. You report to a supervisor, who in tern reports to a manager. The manager reports to the audit partner."
KPMG,1e87djbh9ouf8800,4.0,Great place to start off your career. The experience you will get is unmatched however the hours are not ideal at all. You will work 50-60 hours weeks On your salary and you will work a lot of weekends as well. The work life balance is their biggest pitfall other than that it is a great place to work.
KPMG,1e7r6hpu534fl000,1.0,Learned the organization and my manager did not live the principals they claim and espouse.  Culture shock had previously worked for a highly principled organization that walked the talk.  Not the case at KPMGwalked
KPMG,1e7mi8rp4ov18800,4.0,"Culture is driven by the practice leaders - the environment is set by the partner, which can be a good or bad thing. Good place to start your career, but a small but noticeable step down from the Big 4 leaders."

KPMG,1e76jkaaeotfj800,5.0,Big four was not for me. I did not like the culture or the on boarding process. I felt like I was handed a computer and told to go audit a multi billion dollar public company with no guidance.
KPMG,1e73a1pmb4rj2800,5.0,"I very much enjoyed working at KPMG, Although I was only a contractor.  The work environment was wonderful with great management.  Wish I could have stayed longer, however COVID had other plans."

Respect, integrity, diversity, fair, rewarding - best place to work hands down."
KPMG,1e5snltomo9i3800,3.0,"This was a very interesting company to work for with lots of exciting projects.  But my area did not have a lot of work to do at times, in other areas there was quite a large amount of work to do, but not all were trained or allowed to do these things.  Found management to be aloof and    there was a limit to group bonding, you were basically on your own all the time almost.  Directions were given too many times verbally and through non-written non-official documents and ways, this made things very confusing and difficult.  On balance was a ""good place to work"" just had many challenges to get past."
KPMG,1e5ortnmfhbon800,5.0,"one of the strongest pillars most organizations rely upon, their existence is unshakable and their quality of services is one of the best. I will like to recommend it to any company that wants the best audit."

KPMG,1e4k9bcisp3rl801,5.0,The manager is so helpful in each task assigned to the team. My manager is very systematic and disciplined. I learned a lot working under her guidance.
KPMG,1e4cfm91goc8o802,1.0,"Management was unfair and racist. The company has great perks but if they don’t like you, it’s impossible to move up or change departments. If I had more support I would of never left the company."
KPMG,1e43k53rrhc22802,3.0,"Pushed out of organization when spouse became sick with cancer. No understanding of personal tragedy, just ""your performance is slipping"" get the work done faster."
KPMG,1e3t61lq7o21v802,4.0,I can say this was a good job for me I mainly had it because of the fact that I was required to work one day out of the week at a company and they placed me here for a 2 years and I honestly liked it.
KPMG,1e3qoo15jocam802,3.0,"I got the job offer after my internship back to the time i was still in school. This is my first job out of college. I am still proud of myself to make to Big4. If you are student and looking for review for one of a Big4, remember that if you choose Big4, you have to know in mind that working long hours, 2-3 busy seasons/ year are just normal thing. You will learn as you go. Now, I realize that many companies are looking to hire people from Big4 or they all came from Big4."
KPMG,1e3o18m08oc9v800,4.0,Decent place to work. Great people that will help you throughout your career. You advance quickly if you're a high performer. Work-life balance is a fairytale.

KPMG,1e3fuesbqo27k802,3.0,Generally a good company but the management team I reported into was flaky and I couldn't trust them. I was a contractor there and one evening they called my recruiter and cancelled my contract with out a direct word to me.
KPMG,1e3an6lgaoc8p805,5.0,"KPMG has a rich history and a system that is comprised of carefully placed values that will develop employees as a professional. Many people can't stand the pressure. They blame the pressure on people, work, and system. Nevertheless, if you learn to work with the pressure and allocate those pressures into personal development of character, you will find yourself appreciated in the work place."
KPMG,1e3613oqjq30v802,2.0,"I don’t doubt that experience for consultants isn’t bad, but the back office BPG jobs here are god awful - think admin/ resource management, EMC, marketing, HR, recruiting, etc.  middle managers skate by doing nothing.  Raises are non existent."

KPMG,1e2jkhl65o2hd802,2.0,"Pleasant physical environment with very little interaction with management. The job itself is very predictable, routine with no variety- borderline robotic. The hardest part of the job is sitting in a seat all day long, with no option to telecommute and no interaction with other people."
KPMG,1e2j896jghael803,3.0,"If you can look beyond the bi-annual fear of having your role outsourced, the constant cost cutting measures, and the lack of raises and promotions this could be a phenomenal place to work."

KPMG,1e1uqfk5lq2u5801,4.0,"Working at KPMG is a great place to establish yourself in the financial world and will open the doors to many future opportunities. Unfortunately, these benefits and opportunities come at a high cost of time and resources. Big 4 accounting companies ask a lot of lower-level employees and do not compensate them accordingly. If you can sacrifice many aspect of your life to put in the time at a big 4 accounting firm, it will pay dividends in the future, but is not preferable when actually involved with the company."

KPMG,1e1sfi081olq3803,3.0,"KPMG thrives on young talent, there is no doubt. However, it becomes clear how much they take advantage of their employees (only after people start dropping like flies). Pay is also ~25% below market value -- you can do better."

You have the privilege of exploring several companies .You have the opportunity to meet CEOs, MDs, CFOs you probably only hear of in the news. It coul be stressful but its worth it."
KPMG,1e14r8qn0hc11801,5.0,1.  Loved the job and people I supported.
KPMG,1e0nrbqgjh6ls802,4.0,Same as the rest of Big 4.  You work a lot and learn a lot and then decide how long you want to stay in public accounting.  I don't think they are ahead or behind any of the other firms.  Individual experiences will vary more due to clients/location than differences within the firms themselves.

KPMG,1e07hrfkjobp4805,1.0,"This KPMG office in Silicon Valley has a first year associate turn over rate of over 50% within the first year. That means 50% of the first-year employees quit before their year is up. Recruitment for this company is a scam. They lure you in with the promise of internal growth and job stability. However, all you receive as a first year is torturous hours, minimal compensation (when you finally do the math), and little to no guidance or support. The recruiters deserve Oscars. They are great at their job. They paint a picture of elitism and success. They convince college students into believing they will be entering the business and accounting world on top. They tell you that you will be working a couple hours later than usual during a busy season that lasts 1-2 months. The reality is that these students are crushed into accepting a sub-par lifestyle that devalues them as human beings. Any free-spirit they have going into this job is obliterated. In order to continue working here, one must accept an ideology in which their time means nothing. I have and will continue to warn individuals exploring employment at this office. I will tell them the truth. The ""busy season"" that lasts ""1-2 months"" is a lie. You can get assigned to a second, maybe even a third. The ""extra couple hours"" is also a lie. Try leaving at 11PM after working through lunch and dinner and not being provided a single break. The management bears no responsibility. The environment is not one of support and guidance. Rather there is resentment and irritation at a beginner's inability to perform a task they were never"

KPMG,1e0362oioq3n1801,1.0,They work you to death day and night - work life balance is an issue.  Management is awful and doesn’t listen to your requests sir time off.  Time off is not really time off your still working.

KPMG,1dvjom0bvo1hc803,2.0,Company often values profits over people when it comes time for bonuses/raised; often only leadership is rewarded for their efforts.  The hardest part of the job is often getting the work required done with the resources provided.

KPMG,1dr6oefbs24f2005,4.0,I thoroughly enjoy the company culture at KPMG. The managers are extremely intelligent and are more-than willing to put down their work for 20 minutes to help teach/explain a concept.

KPMG,1dq9slc66h46a801,2.0,I wasted a year here with my boss encouraging people to not work with me. Selling air and lots of politics.  It was an experiment that those of us working the plan didn’t know. People fight over their share of commissions and guard their territory and customers with a deadly force. Depressing offering help to people that don’t want it.
KPMG,1dq8jufvoh3ua80a,5.0,One of the best best best work life experience. I didn't like that the pay was not market competitive but one of the best work life balance and company culture.

One of KPMG's core values is open and honest communication, but they don't give honest communication regarding feedback or promotions. After getting fed up with inconsistent feedback I looked into other firms. Ended up at another firm, making a lot more money, and feeling like I am appreciated.

KPMG,1dn3aslkjh3p0802,4.0,"I feel like KPMG is a great company. However, I think in my current position there is an expectation that you work regardless of whether you should be working at that time. I feel like I cannot truly disconnect and recharge. Then when I do return there is almost a guilt trip feeling for taking my time off. I don’t feel like it promotes a good working culture."
KPMG,1dn13fqrp5nbu804,4.0,"KPMG offers a work-life balance. Process and metrics heavy are detrimental to the Agile process. Mix experience with work culture, get cooperation from colleagues and team members. Management is becoming process heavy and business value is getting sideline."

KPMG,1di6bh58g52so801,3.0,"KPMG is a great place to build a career. That being said, it is not a place you should sit around and think that you will make manager. After 3 years, look somewhere else unless you are on partner track and are sure of it. Even if you are, you will need to wait a long time with no guarantee. They will tell you if you leave how big of a mistake you are making but they never left and don't know anything else. DO NOT listen to them. You leaving only hurts them and their current way of life. If they lose you, they have to work harder and replace you. They do not care about your career and it is everyone for themselves. If you remember and live by that, you should be fine."
KPMG,1di5tpiech3js800,4.0,The Advisory practice provides lots of opportunities and is full of energetic and knowledgable talent.  The practice is always growing and extremely adaptive to changing markets.

KPMG,1dd8vbrifh3j5800,3.0,"Contractors in KTECH NJ are not offered the chance to join the firm as associates. For some reason be it incentives or what have you, St. Louis seems to be their priority. While I was with the firm I saw hard working contractors with tons or experience and who could have done wonders for the firm being let go after a very suspicios 2 year limit. This dilutes the knowledge base and they have to constantly train new contractors. This only occurs in NJ. St. Louis seems to have an unlimmited budget alloted as people start there as contractors and suddenly are brought in as FTEs( Full Time Employees ) regardless of seniority, Once you are in the sky is the limit. People get promoted quickly for whatever reason. However again, this only happens in their secondary location in St. Louis. So if you want to move to the MidWest please feel free. If you are in the NY/NJ area strap on for two years of no benefits , PTO , anything. You will NOT get anywhere and you will be given a nice bye bye after you put in your time, sweat and tears, Watch others advance because of where they live."

KPMG,1dck49kce52u0800,3.0,"KPMG really tries to foster good working culture.  However, in 2019 the culture in IT areas are very toxic due to some reorg and such.

This is my opinion of the immediate areas within my responsibilities.  It may be different in audit/tax/advisory areas."

KPMG,1dcfp6tqhb86k800,4.0,"You will work very hard during busy season, which is hard if you have a family. But the people are great. You learn a lot and the client exposure is fantastic. Benefits and time off are excellent. If you can stick this out, it's a good career."
KPMG,1dc7etluuh40j800,4.0,"This was one of the best jobs I've ever had in terms of learning the accounting trade.  I was fortunate enough early on to be assigned to mostly small business audits, which set the stage for the rest of my career and my love for the small business culture.  I wouldn't trade my KPMG days for anything professionally!!"
KPMG,1dc5llu645nck800,4.0,Not bad overall. Bottom line rules but there are some concessions to humanness. Salary and benefits decent. Workspace is getting less private with stations and replacing cubes and offices. You could do worse.
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."

KPMG,1d9slegk55j4j800,1.0,"KPMG is the worst place I ever worked. They had week one trainings but that was it. I was a first year and sent to do an audit by myself. I had one day in a year of working there where I was sitting next to a senior manager who actually talked to me about the auditing I was doing. You are on your own there and expected to work insane hours - jobs started at 8 and regularly worked until 10:30 or midnight. Leaving was the best decision. One person I started with said it the best - “This job has negatively impacted every relationship in my life”. You can learn more, work less, earn more, be happier and live longer somewhere else."
KPMG,1d9dm3u66b81j800,5.0,"There were flexible hours where assignments and deadlines were given and I was allowed to accomplish those under my own direction. Guidance was provided as needed.

KPMG,1d8n84e2sb890800,3.0,"KPMG is a great place to start your carerr, but isn't ideal longterm. There is very little work/life balance, and the company is not concerned with this problem at all. So, there;s not a lot an employee can do to improve it. You learn a lot, but it's hard work."

The days can be long and there are times that will require working over the weekend.  Like most Big 4 accounting firms the job needs to get done, however it is especially challenging with a lack of available resources.  Many times as a manager you end up filling the Senior Associate , Manager and Director Role."
KPMG,1d8j86osb5j5g800,3.0,"KPMG on the whole is a solid firm with lots of smart, talented people. My own experience within the group formerly known as KTech left a good bit to be desired though. Aftershocks from last years’ reorganization continue to be felt, resulting in territorial disputes and backstabbing and a pervasive sense of impermanence. When will the next shoe drop, and why should I stick around long enough to get caught in the crossfire?"
KPMG,1d82732oo24e5000,2.0,Management is busy most of the day in CYA and throwing employees under the bus is common practice.

KPMG,1d7k9sdqj0mti000,3.0,Expected hours vary based on your location and role. At one point I had reduced hours as part of a flexible schedule for child care. At the end I was working 100 hours a week and it wasn't enough for them. I was headed toward a heart attack.
KPMG,1d7i65i4v1bg1000,3.0,"If you're not ready to sell to get promoted to senior levels within the firm, this is not the place for you.  You could make manager without selling, but as soon as business declines you'll be the first let go."
KPMG,1d7ephs8e1d12000,2.0,"Not the worst company to work for, not the greatest. They like to say that you ""own your career"" here, but my experience has been that my career owned me. Career advancement advice was not given to me at all in my first 3 years and I had to figure everything out on my own. My PML's were absolutely horrible. By the time I got promoted, almost 5 years into my career, all of my colleagues had already been promoted twice and it was humiliating to be promoted to a level that all my coworkers literally started at. I had to finally tell myself enough is enough and leave."

These scenarios have a tremendous impact in a person financials and should not happen."
KPMG,1d6tpt1041ah3000,3.0,"-Being one of the Big 4 accounting firms, there were definitely some smart people there and the company was doing good business. The work being done at KPMG is pretty boring since it is accounting and auditing based."
KPMG,1d6tirvvr24e6000,5.0,"I enjoyed working at KPMG as the culture is very modern, the employees are young, and the benefits are great. The lack of work life balance is my main con.

Generally was a positive experience, though at the end of the day it is still consulting and it is still pretty stressful. I liked the vast majority of the people I worked with, and benefits were very good.

KPMG,1d5mer075akcj800,1.0,"Their business model is hiring accountants out of college, using them 60 hours/week, and hoping they leave.  Their stated motto is ""A great place to start a career"" because its great to put a big 4 on your resume, but nobody stays very long."

Of the opportunities I was able to take advantage of to the individuals I've met, I have not regrets starting my career here. I've learned so much and developed so much as a professional that I know my strengths and weaknesses better now than I ever did or could working elsewhere. There are drawbacks for the culture here as too mirroring and grouping, but (getting passed that) will prove worthwhile if your career path has a stop here. If you understand this portion of the firm, then KPMG can be a great stepping stone for new hires, experienced and managing employees."

KPMG,1d0b9rld91ahv000,5.0,"Still work here, love it. Hoping to augment with remote part-time work. KPMG Spark has an incredible atmosphere and an executive team that is humble and hard working."
KPMG,1d0aptkrvb80h800,4.0,"The management did not offer ready advancement to new positions within the company.  There was too much of a ""good old boy"" environment.  There were too many ""political"" situations in this organization."
KPMG,1d07um9e50kbv000,3.0,Expect to work on potentially boring projects with no say in the matter. But putting in your service time is worth it for the resume boost for grad school or next career step.
KPMG,1d07u9dd51ahv001,5.0,Great place to start and grow your career with exposure to complex and interesting projects. Downside is that hours can be long with significant travel (depending on project).
KPMG,1d07phonl0mtf000,5.0,Overall friendly work environment. Pleasant surroundings. Diverse workforce.  Training courses provided to all employees no matter what your title/ position is. Approachable management within most departments.
KPMG,1d07l956l1aie000,1.0,"This was a short contract position.  On my first day there, my manager literally screamed at me in front of co-workers.  It only went downhill from there.  I finally picked up and left after 2 months of being abused"
KPMG,1d07e35rp0t7u000,4.0,I have been working at KPMG full-time
KPMG,1cvqqmppi5nch800,5.0,"Variety of learning opportunities, high energy culture, lots of job security, highly independent work projects with minimal supervision, frequent job training requirements and incremental administrative tasks at all job levels"
KPMG,1cvlnm6rv1agu000,3.0,Big 4 accounting work that was mostly done for large corporations.  Assisted in audits and other activities outside of my area of expertise.  Was allowed to expand my knowledge base by volunteering for other duties.
KPMG,1cv6kcmfv1ahe000,4.0,"Great place to work! Hardworking employees! High engagement, Flexible schedule and paid holidays. Great leadership and feedback. Offers benefits to full time employees"
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1cv6a6h7c0kbv000,4.0,I'm the kind of person who knows how to execute difficult tasks with precision. I pay attention to all the details of a project. I make sure that every task is just right and that it is completed in a timely manner.
KPMG,1cv4559hg0mte000,2.0,"KPMG is a great place to work. The environment is suited for a person who like to be challenged and who's not afraid of change. Most days are very different from the prior day. If you have the right/experienced management, this can be a career that you would want to stay in for awhile. Although work-life balance can be a challenge in this envirnoment, strong work relationships are ususally built with your team."
KPMG,1cv3jta641aid000,3.0,Learned 5 years of business for every one year worked.  Fast paced.  Very rewarding if you only like work and want to be a Partner.  TOugh to have older kids and work there.
KPMG,1cv3f7vk80mcu000,5.0,I like working at kpmg.  It offers great work life balance.  Great benefits.   Lots of opportunities for advancements and career moves. great work experience.
KPMG,1cv2134p31ahl000,3.0,Its OK to work here. Sometimes it is very hard and sometimes it is cool. Not too much to complain about. Salary is ok but not great. Growth is limited
KPMG,1cutfnd810mto000,1.0,Middle management did not know how to handle their business. Older employees are held to much lower standards. The culture is toxic. Managers and superiors have no qualms about throwing their admins or in-charges under the bus. Very cut-throat.
KPMG,1cuknkk8r1fdl000,4.0,Experienced associates are held to a higher standard and are expected to perform at KPMG's level from day 1. Every mistake is scrutinized heavily. So have your game face ready
KPMG,1cud3sm8h0mt7000,4.0,"Since it is an audit firm, there is a lot of deadlines to provide Audit and Financial reports."
KPMG,1cu2e4hepas3d801,2.0,"I have worked as a contractor in an administrative position for the past 8 months.  This would be a great place to work for anyone who is a direct hire.  As a contractor, you are barely seen or heard.  The environment is pleasant, the people are professional and the work is manageable.  But KPMG only treats it's own employees with respect, not so much for the contractors."
KPMG,1ctvcmspd0mtm000,4.0,Enjoyable but stressful.  Administrative management offsite and difficult to to feel appreciated.  Felt undervalued.
KPMG,1cttrlufuakbr800,4.0,"KPMG is a great place to work.  I was employed there for 22 years, and was fortunate to have opportunities to work in various positions while I was there.   I made a great number of friends while employed there..."
KPMG,1ctt5hk490mtl000,1.0,"Very cut-throat work environment. They do not give you necessary training to advance skills. If task isn't done 100% correctly the first time, it is held against you. But looks good on resume for when you are looking to leave."
KPMG,1ctisgv5tas3a800,5.0,"Very good corporate company to work for! Family oriented, fast paced job. Worked in the Downtown Dallas office and it was great, good people, beautifully designed office."

KPMG,1csqsceuu9rbl800,3.0,l'environnement de travail ainsi que les outils mis a disposition du personnel sont agréable pour la réalisation des différentes taches.
KPMG,1csd8n7aebrff800,3.0,"I was a summer intern and the managers and peers were great. They were really kind and wanted to see me grow. However, the work may not be the most exciting and was also kind of slow."
KPMG,1cs9ih8pbbrf8800,3.0,"Good place to start career, learn a lot fast and lots of options to learn and get promoted. However it's unsustainable and burn out happens fast. Pay is abysmal for the amount you work."
KPMG,1crqclt7gb87f800,3.0,The commute beat me down. I did not enjoy the work environment or culture. Everyone seems to be a robot with little interest in outside activities besides accounting.
KPMG,1crq79dl3b87f800,5.0,"Great Experience, simply exploring opportunities in other fields outside of cyber security. looking to leverage previous work experience. Also looking internally at KPMG"
KPMG,1crpvsfjf5j70800,4.0,Great place to build your resume and learn new technical skills. Take advantage of all the trainings instead of seeing how little you can get away with!
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1cro2vu9l5nb8800,4.0,No 2 days are the same and the people make all the difference. Great vacation benefits and both 401K and pension.  Work life balance is a challenge especially during key times of the year.
KPMG,1crgv2l1v5j6j800,3.0,The hours during busy season in one week can be over 90 hours. During non peak seasons weekly hours are expected to be 40-50 hours. Anytime PTO that is to be taken needs to be signed off on by all team managers.
KPMG,1crfck2715j6j800,4.0,"Employees are provided with depth of experience and exposed to leaders in a large range of industries, and provided with opportunities to grow constantly."
KPMG,1crefr196ak73800,4.0,A purely Accounting and Auditing Company which places premium on Prudence and Integrity.
KPMG,1crd945l25nev800,3.0,"This is a good firm to get into if you have no other options and need to have a brand name on your resume. Otherwise, get your resume bulked up and get out. There is no opportunity to develop your career the way that you want to. The work-life balance is absolutely awful and the pay makes that fact even worse. Much better off with Deloitte if anything."
KPMG,1cras4351ake6800,3.0,I enjoyed working for this compnay because I was able to gain legal skills and experience in the corprate arena. I was able to utize these skills to get future employment in my field.
KPMG,1cr67rgau5neu800,4.0,Challenging Work Environment. Managers with strong technical skills but lacking in softer managerial abilities. Very long hours during busy season and close.
KPMG,1cr3cbv415j6i800,4.0,I enjoyed my time working at KPMG.  I worked for senior management in the Financial Services area.  Direct contact with Senior Partners.  I was rewarded for my efforts with raises.
KPMG,1cr32pg1q5j6i800,3.0,Long hours
KPMG,1cqusi0msbrem800,3.0,Receive the opportunity to work with clients from different industries. It could be challenging to strike a work/life balance and have decent compensation
KPMG,1cquiatlgb832800,1.0,So I worked with KPMG while they were forcing rank and file employees to divest of any stock held in companies the firm worked with.
KPMG,1cqop4gh5b86v800,3.0,"This job stinks and everyone knows it.  You pay your dues and work ridiculous hours.  That's then gig.  You learn a lot, and most of the people suck, but whatever, it gets you where you need to go."
KPMG,1cqol5e3mb8an800,5.0,SUMMARY OF EXPERIENCE
KPMG,1cqntnisk5nao800,5.0,"Exceptionally positive environment to work. Excellent career progression and good pay. Lot of opportunities for growth and development, effective appraisal process and development"
KPMG,1cqkdvua152uq800,2.0,Required long work hours and the hardest part was lack of training. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers. We learned a lot through on-the-job training and co-workers helping each other.
KPMG,1cqg7lpme5j6b800,4.0,Many types of opportunities available
KPMG,1cq9hsalobrec800,4.0,I was an employee at KPMG for over 9 years and enjoyed most of my time there.  There were instances where I felt I was unappreciated but left that position when I did.
KPMG,1cq4a4amu5j67800,4.0,"As an audit intern, I has very challenging projects and work, but the teams I was a part of were always willing to explain concepts to me."
KPMG,1cpvs66qc5neb800,3.0,Great perks and flexibility.  There is also room for growth and advancement.  The company cares about its employees and is about work life balance and volunteering
KPMG,1cpv2rdl85j64800,4.0,Great place to work. Team was professional and internal clients were engaged. Work/Life balance depends on the team on which a person worked. No work/life balance on this particular team.
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1cpt433gj5j64800,4.0,Its a very competitive and thriving culture. The hours can be very challenging especially in tax and audit positions however you have many benefits such as flexibility to work from home as long as it fits the business model you are working in. They offer great medical and dental plans and you can contribute to a 401(k) which is great for your future.
KPMG,1cpsel9nkas1p800,2.0,"Working for one of the Big 4 is a very challenging adventure, I'm convinced it's a very good school to develop technical skills, but it would get in the middle of a balanced life"
KPMG,1cppjv9biakdm800,4.0,"KPMG was my first job out of college.  For a CPA starting a career, I couldn't have asked for a better company.  The work was challenging and rewarding.  Management was excellent and provided significant support in the advancement of my career.  Through the variety of clients I worked on, I gained invaluable experience across a variety of industries that I use to this day.  The workplace culture was professional, dedicated and truly enjoyable."
KPMG,1cpnqr1s7b82f801,4.0,"How well you end up liking the company depends on which department you are in and who you work for.  They claim to have flexible work schedules and the ability to work from home, but that is not true throughout the entire organization.  Most people tend to work long hours while others in the same department don't.  Sometimes a manager's perception is distorted on who is busy or who is the most productive."
KPMG,1cpnagff452uf800,5.0,In almost every work place the team/coworkers can make or break ones experience there. While at KPMG I had the pleasure of working with be best team imaginable. I would definitely work there again
KPMG,1cpk0j4q55nab800,5.0,An organization providing you the opportunities to:
KPMG,1cpibbmvd52uf800,4.0,same as bearing point
KPMG,1cpd4cer15na5800,4.0,I started there directly from there and was promoted five times during that period.  I learned a great deal during those early years of my career.  I believe those experiences were crucial to allow me to achieve what I have to date.
KPMG,1cpcsqbrlak68800,2.0,Typical large entity exhausting staff and promoting only certain desirable staff.  Just a stepping stone out to the real world for most of us.  No true value or lessons learned; no mentoring or serious attention to education on the job training.
KPMG,1cpapccegakhe800,1.0,"A typical day at work was answering phone calls, directing clients to the appropriate auditor or associate staff, provide administrative assistance by composing invoices, meeting minutes, letters, time and expense reporting, composing and coordinating travel arrangements and meetings. I did not learn much because the staff spent most of their days at client sites working on their books but when they were in the office that is when I was provided administrative tasks. The workplace culture was extremely competitive and therefore created a hostile environment. Not only were the auditors very disrespectful to me, the management did nothing to improve their treatment of me and allowed it to continue. He himself was not very respectful to me. The hardest part of the job was pleasing the staff. They are very high maintenance, unappreciative and display an entitlement attitude. The most enjoyable part of my job was having the opportunity to make arrangements for the office to participate in community events and show their interest in helping others."
KPMG,1cpaiao09aka2800,5.0,"This was an exciting job, big projects, fast paced, learning and transitioning with new clients. Could have travel or general placement, many options. Great opportunities for IT professionals. The hardest part of the job was not being in an office normally and not really knowing others in your line of command. The most enjoyable part was getting to meet new clients, build relationships and stay really busy."
KPMG,1cp8rumbeaka2800,4.0,KPMG has provided me great learning opportunities and accelerated my career path in the time that I've been here. They have good benefits and do their best to make sure employees feel welcomed as much as possible.
KPMG,1cot34kncaqhd800,4.0,This is a great company to work for. You will be exposed to many people and different types of work. You have flexibility on what type of projects you'd like to be on and what you want to learn and be able to do for yourself.
KPMG,1corf8b2p52u5800,2.0,"When you're busy, you're verrry busy, and when you're not, your teams don't know how to handle that, so they make you stay late anyways. You'll always be on at least 3 year-end audits every year, sometimes more. If your biggest client isn't super busy, resource management will just move you on to another team that is."
KPMG,1coeo1ua9brdt800,3.0,- Tons of opportunities to learn and grow
KPMG,1coecd1pl5j5q800,5.0,"Excellent place to jumpstart your career. Get experience with the biggest companies. Highly respected. At any one time, had an engagement manager, performance manager, and assigned mentor."
KPMG,1cocndmo0akd7800,3.0,"Company offers a smorgasbord of advisory services to compliment tax and audit, but sees the world through the lens of financial management. Independence is top of mind, all the time--as it should be--and effects everything you do from investment management to opportunity pursuit. Workforce is relatively young and vibrant."
KPMG,1co2cu3gjb81v800,5.0,"KPMG is a remarkable place to work. It is a Big Four Firm that provides the training, experiences, and opportunities that set employees apart from other individuals within the public accounting/consulting realm. KPMG is as good as it gets!"
KPMG,1co271u6s52tr800,4.0,KPMG was my first job out college. I learned about taxation of U.S. branches of foreign banks.  The hours were long and unforgiving but I learned a great deal.
KPMG,1cnvllss352tr800,2.0,I think KPMG seems to have a lot of smart young people and a lot of other people who love their titles and think that they deserve respect based solely on the length of time they've been there and the fact that they leeched onto someone along the way and got promoted above where they deserve. They bill you out for the max possible rate but want to give you the least amount of paid training possible. Other than the compensation there isn't a single thing I could recommend about working here.
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1cnqiim4hakgva36,4.0,"A typical day at my work includes having an important meeting with a client, provide updates (via email and powerpoints). I have learned a lot about managing project and how to host workshops to gather requirements and present them to other teams and have to lead a team."
KPMG,1cnqeut5dak5ldl0,4.0,It is a good place to start you career. You learn alot. The people are nice. The busy season is year around and you will average 50 hour weeks for a majority of the year.
KPMG,1cnqc3tp65n9kche,4.0,"Busy seasons can be difficult, a good deal of turnover at the management level caused a large break in communication and goodwill.  Employees were often pigeon-holed and stuck working for one client or partner.  Not enough exposure to different managers and partners.  Partners not involved in the employee process enough to make the decisions regarding their employees that they do.  Too much of the process is filtered through a manager without nearly enough hands on discussions with employees.  Partners become invisible until deadlines or special events, but more day to day contact and understanding of their employees would go a long way."
KPMG,1cnpl56si5j5fdl7,5.0,"great compapy and great people, work life balance was excellent in the tax section. salary and bemefits were also very good. Would recommend ths company"
KPMG,1cnhjhf7ab85ka0c,4.0,"Working under the advisory umbrella, the opportunity to work with large companies facing challenging problems is the upside. The downside is the amount of travel required. Traveling 100% presents challenging problems with work/life balance."
KPMG,1cng3phhv5ndh9kn,2.0,"Not great.very stuffy environment and daily desk hoteling is incredibly annoying.  Open floor plan is just the cherry on top when you have inconsiderate employees that don’t know how to use their inside voice. Way too much dude sweat and testosterone leads to office tiffs... If you want to feel uncomfortable for 9 hours a day, come work here..   Everyone seems so uptight and it’s almost like everyone is watching each other there. The daily gossip I know is in every office but more than usual here. I think that it would actually be a place I would like to stay long term if they would actually institute a work remote policy for everyone... I think this day in age we should be trusted to complete our daily tasks without the feeling of being watched all day. The stress from that alone is enough for the high turn around rate.."
KPMG,1cndqq8vob89f90h,3.0,"I worked here as an intern, and the work is challenging. But- unless you're really liked by specific people on the team, there aren't really opportunities for advancement or growth. Fix the management culture, and your people will thrive!"
KPMG,1cndfmvbd5j5cbs3,4.0,"Great place to work to get started, but can be exhausting.  Significant hours, aggressive behaviours from those looking to advance quickly which are rewarded.  Very competitive amongst staff levels.  Senior levels are mostly sales focused."
KPMG,1cncjvv26brdfaba,5.0,Overall great place to work for a self motivated individual.  One has to manage their own career growth as it is easy to get lost in a matrixed organization.  I gained so much experience working for the company as I was able to work across a variety of industries and was exposed to a large variety of fortune 500 companies.
KPMG,1cn5jv1plaqgsdib,4.0,"Good place to start a career. Traning is excelent. Support from management is good. Partners are fair. Diverse workforce, clients are appreciative of the value delivered."
KPMG,1cn4ano735j5b8it,3.0,"Global company with many opportunities to grow, numerous training courses and excellent company for new consultants. Can have extensive hours expected to work."
KPMG,1cn48g91vakcrdk8,4.0,"Like most big 4 firms, KPMG employees some of the best professionals in the industry, develops them well, and creates a spring board for either advancement within the firm, or a great placement in industry."
KPMG,1cn4124s852tg8rk,5.0,KPMG offers your an opportunity to spread your wings by giving autonomy in job performance. A solid appraisal system is intact where nothing talented goes unnoticed.
KPMG,1cmqo8qc8b89deg7,3.0,Great place to get your CPA and gain valuable experience. Overall the job itself is pretty mundane and hard to enjoy. The busy season hours don't help either.
KPMG,1cmqj1l2hak9b9rt,3.0,"Pace is very busy, but very rewarding, also.  Some travel was included in my job, but not so much as to negatively impact my quality of life.  Being happy at your job there probably depends a lot on who you report to.  Overall, a good company."
KPMG,1cmqgflqgak5f92c,3.0,Conducted financial audits for a variety of private and public industries including governmental agencies under rules of G.A.A.P. Performed compliance audits for the Department of Education.
KPMG,1cmodu98b5ndfdo0,4.0,Great company to meet a ton of smart people. You get a chance to work in different engagements and network if you get in the right group. You also get to travel quite often.
KPMG,1cmnm9f93aqgr9dc,4.0,I was in the administrative end so working with a number of people along the way.  It was a fast-paced company and was constantly busy.  Would recommend working here.
KPMG,1cmmji3pqbrdbfpm,5.0,"For a big four, KPMG is probably the best one to work at. it offers global movement and a variety of groups both internal and external. You can either work in support or up front with the clients."
KPMG,1cmm7df005j588pc,3.0,"Although work/life balance is not in comparison to other big 4, KPMG provides a structured and competitive work environment where those who perform well are well rewarded."
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1ckq5tpo3b84hd7r,4.0,I have always been able to manage a work life balance with a 21 hour per week schedule. I love being a administrative assistant. I enjoy collaborating with the owners of the firm.
KPMG,1ckdmp4pc1bgd785,4.0,"Aside from KPMG being a great place to advance your career, perks such as Jump Start Fridays in the summer, company closing between Christmas and New Years, Company Holiday party and Summer Picnic are a nice bonus."
KPMG,1ckddfuns0mtu1m7,5.0,"Corporate culture so far has been surprisingly good. YMMV from team to team, but I have had great experiences thus far. Tone from the top is great."
KPMG,1ckd6q08l1ags4u7,5.0,"I worked at KPMG during the summer of 2017 as a BPG Intern, along with several other NYC students coming from different boroughs and schools.From the moment I walked into the office, I could tell what a collaborative environment I was in. Everyone is willing to stop and lend a helping hand when needed. You are always kept busy; there is always something to do. The best part of the job is being able to work collaboratively with others, whether an assignment/project or a volunteer opportunity. Through KPMG, I learned a lot about networking as well as the corporate world and the finance industry. It was a great experience and I would definitely go back if I had the chance."
KPMG,1ckakk1nq1bab3ru,4.0,Very busy day great tenants and co-workers. A lot of great eating places. Free laundry and shoe shine. Building is easy to learn and is very quiet at night
KPMG,1ck98j3fi0mtb3v3,5.0,"KPMG, along with all of the Big 4 accounting firms, provide an invaluable start to your career.  The best thing I ever did was go to work for KPMG right out of college.  It establishes your career, and opens up a ton of doors throughout life."
KPMG,1ck8ujkas1ahq541,3.0,I only did an internship in the deskside support department for about 7 weeks. Good experience but it might be hard to get a full time positions there.
KPMG,1ck8kr4ap0mcr6ef,3.0,There are several paths one can take to achieve their goals as long as those goals coincide with those of the firm.
KPMG,1ck6mnr3l1ahk5t3,4.0,"Working at KPMG has opened many doors in my career. The hours are long but the experience in invaluable. Culture and tone depend on the office, overall it was a great experience."
KPMG,1ck0dpc7k0mt775t,3.0,"One of the primary reasons I left, was due to the fact that many positions were being filled by contractors. They did not give a sense of job security."
KPMG,1ck05s4ns1agn52a,3.0,KPMG is a great company but you feel the pressure to work long house to complete work. There are way too many meetings and you have to work late in order to complete your work due to being in meetings all day. In order to move up in the company you need to sacrifice your family time and show your commitment to the company in order to be recognized. Salary can be better. Not enough for someone with a large family.
KPMG,1cju693871ai3307,5.0,Good place to work to gain great fundamental financial background and see how many companies do things.  Great way to learn Best Practices in a short time.
KPMG,1cjr1v2301ah54ao,3.0,"KPMG is an awesome firm to work for! However, the engagement I’m currently assigned to is poorly managed with unorganized project teams.  From my experience on this project, I’ve been treated unfairly by Senior Associates. It’s sad what one would do just to get noticed in hopes for a promotion to the next level.  The actual project manager and Directors are beyond amazing! Super nice and caring!!!(Although they’re not on site as much). A “manager” is actually “running” the project as Deputy Project Mgr and you can really see the lack of experience. Here on this project, I feel like only a number who’s filling a position. There’s also NO WORK LIFE BALANCE. You’re expected to work overtime with NO COMPENSATION or incentives. The traveling gets overwhelming too. The Deputy Project Mgr really does not care about the employees and she leads with her emotions OFTEN. I’m really thinking about transferring to another area of the firm or requesting a different engagement."
KPMG,1cjn6acv9akh383e,3.0,"Like most big 4 jobs, most people are looking for exit opportunities. Good place to start a career and make connections, but its depressing seeing most of your coworkers leave."
KPMG,1cjfkem4d5j54am3,5.0,I was only here for a few months but the office atmosphere was fantastic. Everyone that I had met had been supportive in my success and transition into a large company life style.
KPMG,1cjcvvtopas17bsj,4.0,"Recruited as first team member to launch start-up firm focusing on middle income housing and commercial real estate markets. Administer internal finance, including cash management, vendor payments, and account reconciliations. Coordinate activities of 8 multi-functional staff to manage operational, financial, and strategic performance. Assess new projects to ensure alignment with long-term goals. Manage debt agreements, minimize interest expenses, and issue quarterly financial statements. Analyze pro forma for 6 major real estate projects. Prepare annual operating budget. Cultivate strong relationships with local and state government officials, as well as vendors and community members to communicate corporate vision."
KPMG,1cj99eqr2ak558er,4.0,"Work/life balance is difficult at the senior level, but is much better at the manager level. The biggest hurdle I've faced has been high turnover of senior associates, and the firm not being able to replace them quickly enough, or with sufficient resources."
KPMG,1cj75dtu7ak55f54,4.0,"I did the typical 2-3 year stint in public accounting, and then transitioned to a job with better work/life balance.  KPMG provided a solid foundation of experience for my career in accounting/finance."
KPMG,1cj6hfv9pak978kq,4.0,"KPMG invests a lot in its employees by providing ongoing training in topics realted to an employee's industry, function, and career development. The company's performance management process is one of the best in the world."
KPMG,1cj3lk958akgufso,3.0,"My typical day would begin during the beginning of the month. Each month the clients would submit their data for sales and use tax. The process begins with the checklist, reports and funding. The work is very stressful because of deadlines and errors that may occur during the process.

In this company I have learned how to prioritize and delegate when responsibilities are not relevant to my work package. Our work culture is business-like, but still down to earth.

KPMG,1chod5242as0mbch,4.0,Started at KPMG right after college in their advisory program.  Our group had a good work life balance compared to others.  Experience at KPMG is directly correlated with your Managers and projects.  If you are lucky enough to have good Managers and projects your time at KPMG will be enjoyable and rewarding.  I learned a lot during my time at KPMG but long term KPMG does not offer what I am looking for in my career.

KPMG,1chlsb0fk5ncmdrp,4.0,This organization is too large to provide true career development.
KPMG,1chgo2fh4akgga5v,1.0,"Some interns were treated better than FT employees. The corporate culture changed during my time with the firm (17 years) and with management not willing to take the necessary steps to make improvements, the work environment grew more and more toxic. Many employees left the firm leading up to my separation from the firm. There is a high turnover in F&A and Intl Tax."
KPMG,1che3fg4kaqggerr,3.0,"A typical day is structured around meetings, and then after 530pm, you could begin work. Team management is not a supportive of work/life balance as the firm management which is disappointing. The firm culture does a great job at thanking employees for their hard work, but that does nto always trickle down by manager or group."
KPMG,1chcckip41d1f1mj,3.0,"I enjoy auditing. I enjoy KPMG. I think my job is a huge stepping stone for my career and I honestly learn so much. My only real complaint is that more often than not, I feel like I am just a warm body. They preach family/work life balance, but I've worked more 65+ hour weeks than not.

KPMG,1cgu8lg6g1agv4rh,3.0,overall is a good place to work but the management keeps involving people who don't know the daily struggle.  I would say they really need to work on this concerning admin managers and i think they will lose a lot of great admins if they focus too much on piling work rather than quality.
KPMG,1cgu518mf0mtv1cd,3.0,"I started as an intern here, and worked my way up to Senior Associate. My time spent here has not been the best. The work/life balance is non-existent. You have no control over your life/schedule. You follow everyone else to the tee. It is hard to be an individual here. You are required to move as one. I will say, the perks and benefits are great, but if you value your personal life and aspirations, working for this Big 4 firm, may not be the best option. I am currently transitioning out of the firm. I can no longer spend 14+ hours a day, behind a computer, with no life."

KPMG,1c4tik6oeaka0aqg,1.0,"KPMG itself appears great, though I haven't had much of a chance to interact with the colleagues from the greater firm. But the J&S practice is literally tied for the worst job I've ever had! The Senior Associates doing all the work are, for the most part, great, and the work is important... but the team culture, as actively dictated by management, is incredibly toxic. Hence, everyone is forced to act the worst version of themselves, just to keep their jobs. People are deliberately pushed to compete against each other, creating a never-ending cycle of ""but X does more than Y, so X is better,"" regardless of actual value delivered. It's all personality-driven, based on egos and luck. There is no concept of work-life balance; in fact, even mentioning it will earn you an eternal mark on your reputation. The amount of lies that are being spread around by both recruiter and management is impressive, if not staggering. Run, do not walk, away from this practice."

The culture is one that includes, not ostracizes it's staff, seniors and managers.  As a leader in the firm, I was given carte blanche access to whatever I needed to improve the lives of the staff/seniors/managers working the very long hours during the first few years of SOX attest."
KPMG,1b9hto0nmas1jfh1,4.0,- great mentorship
KPMG,1b9gg1cr452uobc1,4.0,"The hours are terrible, but the opportunity is enormous.  Just like every other Big 4 firm, you'll make way more than you're worth in your first couple of years, you'll soak up a ton of experience during all of your late nights and dinners at your desk, and then you'll be worth way more than you make for a few years.  Anyone who jumps ship at the Senior or Manager level can expect to see a great increase in pay outside of public accounting.  Anyone that sticks around to make partner can expect to wait about 15 years (give or take 3 years depending on the market), but then partner compensation is pretty fantastic."

KPMG,1b56ncimobvu48cm,5.0,"I came to KPMG in large part because of the potential of to work on a multitude of challenging problems with diverse clients and different teams. That expectation has been met and exceeded. As a manager in KPMG, A typical work day starts with a conference call with clients and getting to know their problems. Then I hold status quo meetings with my teams. Everyone openly offer their perspectives. I work with other directors to make decisions on allocation, budget and client meetings.  In the past 5 years, I have been able to take on large amounts of responsibilities very early in my career. I manage my team workload, find ways to motivate the team morale and report to boss the progress, multi-task on various projects. I worked with very smart people. Some of them are promoted to partner in their early 30s. Some left and became controller in fortune 500 companies. Some went back top MBA schools.

KPMG,1b4jvm54m0mtp0ji,3.0,The company has a brand name and is a good place to work for. However one has to be willing to adapt to sudden changes between clients and manager expectations. I would still say that working for this company has helped me learn a lot and understand the work culture.

KPMG,1b3vraaajaqhgalh,3.0,KPMG as an auditor is a very fast paced environment with great employee personnel. There is continuous learning throughout the experience with the firm. Work life balance is not great at all.
KPMG,1b3uscugn52tqf2u,3.0,"Extremely long work hours during tax season. Late or overnight work was pretty normal. Some employees didn't sleep a few days and seniors admired them. Adversely, off season was very slow and hard to fill up chargeability hours."
KPMG,1b3q7l5rg5nag8cd,2.0,"Love the job and a great experience, but no time for myself outside of work.  I just got married and want to be able to have a family in a few years.  Staying at work every day for 13 hours or more is not going to warrant that."
KPMG,1b3lrtvv752tj963,3.0,non-genuine talk about care for the individuals. Management focused on achieving target results through micro managing processes rather than encouraging individual innovation and self motivation.

KPMG,1b383d8uc1d0i63r,4.0,"I found KPMG to be a fantastic place to work in general.  Everyone is very smart but that does not mean you will get along with them.  They do work hard to advance people but tend to end up very top heavy which can make it hard to complete with other firms on price.  I also find that they are a bit slow to take up new technologies that are needed in the industry.  My co workers were great and they work hard to teach me new skills but I find that learning new skills is talked about but not necessarily acted upon by senior management so there was little formal training.    The hardest part of the job was the constant travel which made it hard for me to have a personal life.  Then, when budgets got tight, they cut off travel which made it very difficult to connect with clients.  It is a very entrepreneurial  culture  so you have to make it on your own.  Nobody is going to hold your hand along the way, which can be good or bad.  It is good that it weeds out those that don't make the cut quickly, but it can be bad that everyone is fighting for the same piece of pie."
KPMG,1b3530k241fvi2m6,5.0,"Yo worked hard.  Were appreciated.  Room to grow which I did.  Friendly, professional environment.  Loved to go to work everyday.  Very sad when I found out that my partner was retiring."

It was a great job to start my professional career and I enjoyed being a part of an audit team and learning about the ins and outs of different businesses. The hours were very long during busy season which included 10 hour weekdays and weekend hours from the months of December to April, but I learned a great deal in just the first year. I also started with a large group of college graduates which made for fun office events and parties.  The environment was a little too cut-throat for me and I did not see myself working there long-term."
KPMG,1b23kqfk21agi4o3,5.0,"I would recommend anyone I know to work for KPMG. It's a wonderful work environment, especially for people just out of college.While there are plenty of opportunities to advance within the company, it should be noted that it can be difficult to actually advance due to the size of the company.

KPMG,1b1fta70rak73ftf,4.0,"The culture in KPMG is like that of a family. Everyone works hard and tries to help build each other up. Their intern training program is very comprehensive. In addition to performing associate-level work, I was also assigned special tax research and presentation skills to supplement my professional education. My only problem is the lack of work life balance. Outside of work, I found that I didn't have the energy to do anything other than lounge around the house."

KPMG,1av0s373bak548p5,5.0,"KPMG Nigeria was an amazing company to intern with over the summer, the organizational culture of the company is well structured and makes one feel at home right away. I interned for three months, and I wish I could have interned for a longer amount of time, but I had to get back to school. My co-workers were very friendly and treated me with the same respect that they would treat full-time employees. The way the offices were structured allowed for the smooth interaction between supervisors and subordinates. They had an open door policy which allowed easy accessibility to all individuals throughout the company. They also advocated to avoid saying ""sir/madam"" and just refer to people by their first name. This was a huge problem for me, cause everyone was older. But I eventually got used to it. KPMG Nigeria is a very flexible, yet time filing, occupying company. I'm glad I had the privilege to  intern with them."

KPMG,1au6q1r35as2i8dc,2.0,"Mission and vision are on target but not achieved locally in all the practice areas, especially in Management Consulting.   Almost no sense of stewardship and collaboration is limited by policies about sales credit allocation, poorly executed changes in performance management, etc.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with the internal politics."
KPMG,1au150h675nd380k,2.0,"As with most public firms, KPMG has generous benefits and advancement opportunities but you work your butt off to get them. Office politics, long hours and a lack of recognition causes burnout at nearly every rank, but if you put in the time you'll get much further in your career."
KPMG,1attmo65uas2ibdu,5.0,At KPMG the opportunities are endless.  Great work environment with great leaders. The most enjoyable part of my day is all of the different hats I get to wear and the great opportunity I have to network and work with so many wonderful people.

KPMG,1asfen8g852tm874,3.0,KPMG is a very good company to work for however it also depends on the department you are in.  I found that everyone I came across did not like their job.  Advisory is a horrible department because of some of the employees that work for that group. I reported my supervisor to the HR department for harassment and they did nothing about the situation.  I asked for a transfer and they just ignored me.
KPMG,1asbpe1d3b8b6d9m,4.0,"KPMG is a great place to get your feet wet and start a career. I learned a lot and enjoy working here. In my opinion, work life balance is extremely difficult. I enjoy my co-workers and the perks such as insurance, 401k and etc."

A typical day at work consisted of being around people just like myself who like to have fun, learn and engage in challenging projects on a daily basis. It is the planet fitness of the professional realm in the sense that it is a judgment-free zone. Despite the fact that the busy season is a strenuous cycle, you mature and develop in a regimented fashion that all your peers facilitate and understand. The most difficult part of the job is learning on the fly but this is what sets those who excel apart from those that coast.

The work (audit engagements) is tiring and sucks the life out of you."
KPMG,1a86heert5nba821,4.0,"I worked for a small company that was acquired by KPMG. The company I worked for sprung the acquisition on us, so we didn't have a ton of time to accept the change and take it all in. But I've worked for KPMG for two years now, and overall it's been good. The benefits are fantastic. Maternity leave is wonderful. The people are mostly good and mean well. There are some people in management positions that are clueless and don't need to be here.

KPMG,1a5567pjpas17dt0,1.0,"Work life balance is a total lie at this company. They rarely treat their people with humanity, you will have to travel extensively on top of 50-60 hour work weeks.

I was devastated but ended up being much happier and appreciated at my new workplace."

I would not wish it on my worst enemy. They work you like a dog, the pay isn't great but they do have nice benefits. I was an experienced hire so It was a bit different for me than some one coming straight out of college. I got shuffled around a lot and my PML was completely detached and showed no interest in my success or failure.

KPMG,19dbap1sbas0gaq2,1.0,"You can forget having any kind of social life if you work in the KPMG Dallas office and you do any type of tax compliance work.  Managers are required to deliver the work on time with limited resources (e.g., no staff or limited staff) even if the client information is received late.  You can expect to work 18 to 20 hour days during busy season and maybe get some sleep on the weekends if you're lucky.  Some members of management work the same hours so raising the issue is preaching to the choir.  The firm has programs in place for developing their people similar to other big 4 firms, however, I did not  experience any type of coaching.  It was sink or swim for me.  The only upside to working at KPMG was the bonus and pay which isn't bad if you're willing to sacrifice having a life for money."

There are 4 - 5 months of the year where people are required work a minimum of 55 chargeable hours each week (checking email/travel/etc. doesn't count) and no one blinks an eye. Everyone here is your stereotypical white collar, frat boy/sorority girl jerk, and if you don't have the same Type A love of sports, getting white-girl wasted, and working your life away, you won't fit in.

However, I was immediately ""knocked down a peg"" by one of the people doing the orientation. I explained that I ""went permanent"" on X date, and she immediately responded that ""nobody is ever permanent"" ""we just let you use this job"". I thought that to be a very rude and counterproductive attitude. However, once I began work, I enjoyed working in an upscale environment. I was issued a laptop as though it were no more than a clipboard. The down side of that was that I had to carry it home daily and be responsible for it. The worst part of the job was that I was supposed to be in training, yet the girl assigned to my training wasn't training me. I had no idea what was expected of me. When I would ask questions of our supervisor, I would only get vague answers that never helped. The trainer was eventually fired, and still, no one properly trained me, and later on, I myself was let go without warning or explanation."

I thought that to be a very rude and counterproductive attitude. However, beyond that, I thought the perks of working in an upscale office were good. At the time, laptops were assigned as though they were clipboards. The down side of that was that you had to carry it home daily and be responsible for it. Our department moved from the prestigious Peachtree St. office to a regular office off of West Paces Ferry shortly after I began. The strange part was, I was NEVER officially trained in the job I was hired for, and had no idea what was expected of me. Then the girl who was supposed to be training me was fired, and shortly thereafter, so was I. I was never given a reason."

Constantly working with project teams to help create budget files, forecasting project economics and coordinating invoicing processes. Meetings were held frequently during the week with Partners, Senior Managers and Managers. My coworkers were very supportive yet very demanding. This was my first job in a huge company, therefore I learned so much relating to time management, relationship building, and working with a dynamic group of people. The most enjoyable part of my job was the traveling advantages. I attended training classes in other cities as well as having quarterly meetings in Seattle and Los Angeles. The hardest part of the job was learning how to prioritize since the work load was fairly heavy; it constituted a lot of overtime."

KPMG,1796surk34dsgam0,3.0,"The work itself is almost always dry so your enjoyment of the job really depend on the people you are working with. The problem is, teams change very often, and about half the time, there will be someone on your team that will just ruin your day. I mean it may just be my specific experience but I think because of the nature of the job and the emphasis on selling work to advance to manager the most ambitious, people tend to make manager and tend to be very aggressive and not very nice. I'm sure this is true for all Big 4s though so no big deal."

I learned how to test internal controls as well as substantive testing. To be able to test accounts on the balance sheet and income statement it was necessary to have an understanding of the company's operations. During my time at KPMG I learned a vast knowledge of how companies operate and the accounting that went along with it. The people who work at KPMG are extremely intelligent and hard working. I have great respect for all of my co-workers. The hardest part of this job was during ""busy season"" where long hours were expected. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people who I worked with and the opportunity to be exposed to new challenging work."

KPMG,170bj9075adsgc0p,5.0,KPMG is a global leader in audit services and naturally enforces a high performance culture within the firm. The firm has great job growth potential and the fast paced learning environment really enoucrages entry level associates to pick up on responsibility and learn audit and project management skills early on. The young atmosphere also inhibits a great learning environment that makes it enjoyable. However the job is very demanding and despite the firm's efforts to maintain work/life balance it becomes very difficult to do so with multiple busy season and traveling.
KPMG,17096eotm4e0ga6r,5.0,"KPMG is a great work place in which one can learn and grow quickly. On any given day, an audit associate's workload can include performing testwork over various audit areas, such as revenue, meeting with clients for follow-ups, preparing memos and excel tables for testworks, etc. The most difficult aspect of this job is balancing multiple projects or assignments and meeting deadlines. Specifically, the amount of work increases significantly during busy season and the difficult part is managing various projects simultaneously. The enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility to work in many different teams and meet and interact with numerous clients."
KPMG,1708g531l5dsgesl,2.0,"As has been typical of Big Four public accounting firms, the hours were many more than I had been told they would be - 60 hours a week.

KPMG,1700nmt7i5dogc6q,4.0,"The working environment provides for numerous opportunities to gain exposure to upper level management as well as key accounting principles. Work days range from 8 hours during summer months to greater than 12 hours during the busy season (January through March). Each engagement is unique and provides a different working environment in relation to the size of teams and the frequency of manager presence. Associates are typically responsible for more routine accounting areas such cash, prepaids, accounts payable, fixed assets and investments. Testwork includes tests of operating effectiveness over the control environment as well as substantively testing year-end balances through trend analysis and/or selections of individual transactions. Challenges include completing all audit testwork within a short-period of time while staying in the parameters of the established budget. However, the job allows associates to communicate with staff accountants, controllers, and at times, CFO’s which quickly builds on networking and communication skills."

One of the things most enjoyed about my role as senior manager is being provided with the freedom to manage my own schedule while meeting clients timelines with quality service.
KPMG,16v4etp2g5dsge6a,4.0,"KPMG is a great company to work for. For anyone wishing to excel in the accounting field, starting off in a public accounting firm is the way to go, simply because of the wide breadth of experience you will attain by working with them. I was definitely pushed to work harder while with the firm and you learned to manage my time and work a lot more closely with a big team of individuals. The work environment is nice - it's always easy to reach out to any of your superiors and be treated as a person. The hardest part of the job is being able to construct a solid work/life balance, as you will find yourself working around the clock practically all of the time."

KPMG,16tqi5a9uae0gf9h,3.0,"My experience thus far has been average - 2.5 stars would better represent my rating. Unlike other places I have worked, I don't sense the level of cohesion within the Milwaukee tax group that I have previously experienced in public accounting and that I believe to be essential for maximum efficiency and productivity. The group seems disjointed and I believe the ""we"" and ""team"" mentality is absent. Furthermore, the Milwaukee tax group lacks the partner level of leadership that I very much need (and have previously had) at the level I am at in my career. As far as the audit and advisory partners/leaders in Milwaukee, I have had positive experiences similar to the very positive feeling from my exposure to tax partners and leaders in Chicago."

Cypress, KPMG is still making up the development rules as they go along. This job needs around 3-4 people to test the product properly.

I am primarily a teacher so having Imagine works beautifully for after school hours and weekends. They are flexible with my schedule during the school year and always welcoming for me to be full time in the summer. I must say there is turnover in the department but it's just the nature of the job. Many people work temporarily for the summer. I have had several supervisors since I started, but I believe that it has always been a seamless transition. The culture here is amazing. I love that ""Props"" are sent out frequently to recognize people's hard work and achievements, both pre and post pandemic. I have a profound appreciation for the positive light that the participants are put into. It really helps to build meaningful work and be more inclusive of everyone. Not to mention being able to spend my time at really fun community venues with some awesome people, I can't ask for much more. It's so important and productive for people of all abilities to be able to access their communities. I know people complain that there are no breaks, but again that is the nature of the job. During shifts you are allowed to eat with your group, but if you are in a community venue there is no break room to run off to. Also, you are allowed to ""tag"" your group to another instructor and take a brief break. Overall, Imagine! is a great company with great people."
Imagine!,1dsgnlscf33nc003,2.0,"Management does not care about those who work directly with clients.  In addition, when problems or issues arrive they brush them under the rug.  Staff do not get any breaks during the day and there is very little help.  Supervisors take long vacations or ""work from home"" very often.  Staff are burnt out and doing the bare minimum to meet client needs.  From the time i was there, there was all this big talk about ""change"".  Things have only gotten worse.  The only thing that kept me going for so long was the clients.  Basically, staff are under appreciated and over worked.  Not to mention turn over is very frequent and the training is horrible.  Be prepared to jump right into the chaos of unorganization and terrible management who do not care about anything but money."
Imagine!,1dm7r0jh6h3oq802,2.0,"I worked for this company for 11 years. They lose employees on a steady basis and there is a lot of management changes as well. For example, if there are three employees scheduled for a shift and one does not show up, you will be splitting their job with your other coworker. You will be expected to do more work and receive no extra pay for doing so. They also have salary caps. I loved proving care for the dd population but this company is poorly managed and you will feel at times you are being worked to death with no support. They went downhill in the last few years, to the point I could no longer feel good about working for them. I know a lot of long time employees that left recently."
Imagine!,1de7ofoqg1d0o000,1.0,HR doesn't know their own requirements for positions. Communicates poorly. Was given differing information over the course of a few minutes. They're also more concerned about status than experience.
Imagine!,1clev35kdak8rc66,4.0,"The clients and staff members are all great to work with and there's  strong team dynamic between everyone including management. The benefits are really good, but the hourly wage is not enough to live off of comfortably in Boulder."
Imagine!,1ckgam353ak4hbih,1.0,"Low pay with no potential for a raise and dishonest management. Even when you do an awesome job, do not expect more pay. There is no growth potential within this organization."
Imagine!,1bdseq768as1pcj0,5.0,"I worked in a variety of positions.  The culture is great and my coworkers were very friendly and nice. It's a nonprofit so the pay isn't  what you could make at some other places, but they make up for it in great benefits. Hard work, but totally worth it."
Imagine!,1b6tjpp1cakh4ab3,4.0,"This was a great job as a college student and gave great experiences working with a wide range of people. However, management constantly changed as well as employees. Even though employees left there was not much room for advancement."

Imagine!,1a425u933b82mcnu,3.0,"I am a counselor for adults with disabilities and also a mentor when it comes to them becoming more independent and living their life to the fullest of their own potential. I do everything from helping them navigate hard situations and frustrations, to cooking meals and showering. We do many enjoyable outings over the weekend, including shopping, zoo, museum and movies just to name a few. The hardest part of the job is having the patience with the clients, even if they may have some pretty extreme behaviors to work with. I enjoy helping them grow in their lives, and progress into something maybe they were not sure they could become. They have changed my life and I learn something new every day from them, they have strength and perseverance more than most people."
Imagine!,191h7n4stb84gdq1,5.0,"I enjoyed my time with this therapist working as her Counseling Assistant. This job was a volunteer job to obtain hours for my LPC license. I had an amazing time learning how to become a therapist. However, the job that I had paying the bills at home was making it very difficult to see clients. I made the choice to end my time at the clinic."

Craft Health,1dir4di3a0000al3,3.0,Conscientious leadership who attempt to balance clients and staff needs.  Home Health Care is always a challenging area to work in and this company is able to manage this difficult line of endeavor better than several other companies but this is still a difficult line of work and is not for everyone.

The managers were very flexible with my availability and worked with my when it came time meetings. I appreciate everything this company has done for me while I make my next move towards my goals in the Healthcare industry.
Craft Health,1diqqmk9u0000bsf,4.0,Great place to work! Typical day is driving to clients houses and helping them with chores and errands as needed. Worst part is the wear and tear it puts on your car. Best is schedules are MADE to fit what you need AND can easily work for college students.
Craft Health,1diqi40et0000aa7,5.0,There is nothing about Family Home health that I can complain about. Management and our office team is beyond helpful and phenomenal. They are very quick to help out when something doesn’t work or isn’t on our care plans.

Craft Health,1dimio4g20000fpa,5.0,I love working for Family Home Health. I feel valued and respected as one of their CNA's. I enjoy the CE learning modules the company provides. The best part of the job are the company owners. They are supportive about having a work life balance and throw us the best summer picnics and holiday parties. The CEO is very active in our day to day operations.  Joe is very knowledgeable. He knows the ins and outs of everyone's role and can helps us from technical issues to understanding the medical billing manuals.  The HR Manager is amazing. She works on your concerns or issues immediately. The hardest part of the job is that their is so much work/need to do and not enough of us!
Craft Health,1dimhbk1q00008rm,4.0,Working with Family Home Health it's good because I can be at home taking care of my own CHILD.  As a parent I don't have to worry about sharing this responsibility with others.
Craft Health,1dim5ci7t00009tr,2.0,"I work as a respite provider for children with developmental disabilities whom I know from other programs. Once you get used to FHH's system it's not terrible, but it's very difficult to schedule. I schedule directly with parents and providers  but I have to get all visits approved and scheduled by FHH which makes it very difficult to do last minute visits, which I do a lot of."
Craft Health,1dilmvjn70000c0a,5.0,I love working with a team who truly cares. Being a local company gives Family Home Health the ability to be more in tune with the needs of it's patients and staff alike.

Craft Health,1d70j4i5f1ba3000,1.0,"Working in the field for nearly 6 years, I have never come across a more incompetent selection of managers. Between my two managers, there is one who actually does their job, doesn't go on a week long vacation every other month, and treats the employees and clients like they're intelligent people."
Craft Health,1d5sp1h4maqgl800,5.0,"I have enjoyed working with Family Home Health since the day I was hired. The work is well-organized by the office staff and they are very flexible with giving one any necessary vacation/sick days one may need. Hours are completely up to you. Documenting with tablets, though hard to learn at first, is a very nice bonus and allows for independence in one's work."
Craft Health,1crofhc2baqii800,1.0,"i was way underpaid, they only care about themselves, they are a very weird family, they don't communicate, and if they do, its to blame you for a huge problem that you tried to prevent by speaking to them"
Craft Health,1cdvjoj5qas0p821,3.0,"Unfortunately, the management and office staff were frequently  changing and inexperienced which often led to high stress and frustrations."
Craft Health,1c9kfn6k6ak8odgt,5.0,"I started with this company in the field and quickly moved up to a supervisor role. Hard work is noticed and appreciated by direct supervisors all the way up to the administration. While I was in the field, I felt well supported by my fellow nurses as well as my colleagues in the field, I would call it supported autonomy. Overall, great place to work!"
Craft Health,1c90e3mghakjkdgu,2.0,Total waste of my time that I even worked for this stupid company . Company doesn’t have an idea what they need to do .. lots of turn over and poorly managed and a family based business
Craft Health,1bt527ou51ai93j3,5.0,"Working with Family Home health has been a blessing. I started in Jan of this year & since have been bumped up to a higher paid position with more opportunity.

We have an amazing HR lady who is always here to help as well."
