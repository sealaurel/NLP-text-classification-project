KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1f7kh66g5u3hk800,5.0,"Excelente empresa, muy profesional, muy buenas capacitaciones, muy buen ambiente, los salarios se hacen competitivos con el tiempo, pero hay que tener paciencia para alacanzarlos."
KPMG,1f7hlk64mu2ud800,2.0,Worked as a technical support specialist/Help desk technician st the NSC in St.Louis.  I was a contractor and worked there for about 6 months. I was told I would be hired on as a full time employee after 3 months but it was quickly apparent that that was not the case. Several other contractors had been working there for over a year and still had not been converted to full time employees with benefits. It seems crazy to work for a company for a year plus and not have decent benefits or pto because you’re a contractor. And it became pretty clear that I would be in that position for a while.
KPMG,1f7dc94op3kis000,5.0,"Great place to work and to start your career. A lot of pressure as usual in a Big 4 consulting firm. Little work/life balance, but at least the salary is decent."
KPMG,1f797ovhgu2ud800,4.0,"Great place to start your career at. But staying long term is not for everyone. There are tons of learning opportunities and if you are a go-getter and high-achiever (and can work A LOT), you will do great here. The work can be a bit too demanding and stressful for some, though."
KPMG,1f6pujkcn3obs000,4.0,"KPMG has been a great place for me to start my career. The management teams here have ensured that I am learning various skills that I receive exposure to many different clients and industries for my benefit. The company is extremely flexible when working to make sure that you are pursing the goals that you would like within the bounds of the jobs. There are times when I feel like I am being asked to, or are actively engaging in projects that call for more experience. In those cases I feel like I am being under compensated as I am doing work at a higher level than what I am being paid to do."
KPMG,1f6oggblis7es800,4.0,If you are willing to learn and grow then this is the company for you.  There are many opportunities to excel. It’s essential to be able to multitask as you will have many projects.  There will never be a dull day.
KPMG,1f6n342bdt5qv800,4.0,Job security. Flexibility ....Nationally standing up for inequalities...Great Perks...Decent Pay...Management needs to broaden their perspective. Advancement is very hard ..All remote position post covid
KPMG,1f675a7pg3ocs000,1.0,Was told the job was going to be for a minimum of a year.  Was cut loose just after 8 months.  I was banking on that last four months of employment.  I had multiple on going issues with payroll.  Not deducting taxes from check correctly.  Overall this is the worst place I have ever worked.  Would never take another position here if offered one again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
KPMG,1f61acl80s7lk800,5.0,Experience worth having. Every team is managed a bit differently. The culture is very strong and there’s a sense of belonging. The stress level is quite high through
KPMG,1f5ofabuosa39800,3.0,Not worth it. Long hours. Highly stressed environment once you’re promoted to senior. High performance culture. Typical political big 4 environment. Lots of networking events
KPMG,1f5mi53cgsaai800,4.0,"My position was in-house, examining and accounting for the US consulting operations, lots of hours of course, lots of humility needed as learning curve is steep, if you stick to it you’ll be amazed at your professional growth"
KPMG,1f5jl8g4eu2n1800,5.0,KPMG is a great place to work for professionals that are go getters and can succeed with little supervision. The firm enables you to grow as a person and professional in the same time. Everybody that I know is very friendly and willing to help.
KPMG,1f5j0dqnvu2n1800,3.0,A great job depending on your manager.
KPMG,1f5hfe8dl308d000,4.0,"I enjoyed my time working at KPMG. Such nice colleagues and a great atmosphere to work in. KPMG Culture is second to none. It's all about inclusion and welcoming of diversity. The benefits are great. They want you to be healthy and give you time for that daily. The overall attitude of KPMG's upper management gives you the feeling they actually DO care about their employees first and foremost. It is the best company I have worked for, by far, when it comes to how you're treated."
KPMG,1f5a58miusaai800,4.0,"Stressful job with a significant hour requirement during busy season. But good experience, you will learn a lot and you will have lots of opportunity to grow in your career."
KPMG,1f56lk06mo1kn800,3.0,Long hours (obviously). Decent bennies. Good place to start your career. Get that big 4 stamp on the resume. Can lead to better opportunities in industry.
KPMG,1f563edv0saai800,3.0,"Typical Big 4 experience. Eager high achievers getting overworked and underpaid. Busy season is not a season, you stay in overtime most of the year. Learned a lot but until the partners and MDs retire and a younger management group is promoted there doesn’t seem to be much changing in the toxic overwork environment. Minimal work life balance but hours flexibility is nice."
KPMG,1f542c75ou3af800,5.0,"I worked here only for a few weeks, but it is obvious that this is an excellent company.  I can't say enough what a great company this is and I highly recommend it.  I was working from home.  They sent me a laptop and all the equipment I needed to work.  The benefits are amazing.  The company culture is amazing.  The people are amazing.  The pay is amazing.  Work here and you are set for life."
KPMG,1f51e8ltp308d000,3.0,"Not sure why management feels the need to carry on the charade of big 4 work/life balance. It is a bad joke. Its all meant to seem like you are an important part of the company/team but if that was the case, they should treat you way better. Do your time, and once you find an exit opp, take it."
KPMG,1f4sik13iu39f800,1.0,"Would not recommend to anyone. If you weren’t part of the clique you weren’t accepted. Management were always calling, watching and checking up on you. When you’d ask for work you were told they didn’t have anything but in reviews you were punished for not doing enough work."
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1f4r9n071sa8r800,3.0,The pay was the first thing that attracted me to the job. I did not get a return offer after my internshio landed because I was not good at interacting.
KPMG,1f4nr1cm5u392800,5.0,"I enjoyed my time at KPMG and think it is an excellent place to begin a career in the accounting field. The management is very supportive and there is a lot of training to make sure you're up to date. In public accounting, you learn nearly every day, however some of the work is quite tedious."
KPMG,1f4gbaap72v6h000,3.0,"KPMG was definitely a journey. It seems like the management didn't really care what kind of projects that they took on and what that meant for employees. However, I learned more than I could have imagined, worked with some really smart people, and the benefits are great. You also get a chance to work with other large companies."
KPMG,1f4ci4v9bu39f800,3.0,You should know what to expect going in most likely.  Figure out what you want to get out of the experience going in and it will make it more bearable.
KPMG,1f4b0d749u392800,2.0,"I mean, it's Big 4. At the staff level, the biggest attractions to get in are the possible exit opportunities when you get out. If those opportunities don't show up, then really, it's just a big white-collar factory. But for some people it works out staying in so good for them."
KPMG,1f4a4gns6u392800,5.0,"I loved it, always felt good there, people where usually proactive, they provided resources to help employees continue to grow to help their clients achieve their goals, good team environment.  The building was beautiful.  Client locations where also amazing."
KPMG,1f4993bhs2v72000,5.0,I am so happy to be part of the team. They always make sure that you are learning and enjoying and that means so much to them. This internship is fruitful.
KPMG,1f40bbnvanpjm800,5.0,All us secretaries and admin always took care of each other and fill in when needed.  Always celebrated all of our birthdays by going out to nice lunches at Houstons!!  Loved my time at KPMG and miss all my co-workers :)
KPMG,1f3taen5vs7ju800,3.0,I enjoyed my time at KPMG and think it is an excellent place to begin a career in the accounting field. The management is very supportive and there is a lot of training to make sure you're up to date.
KPMG,1f3m37tj5o29g800,3.0,"In public accounting, you learn nearly every day, however some of the work is quite tedious. The hours during busy season are typically quite intense and will require you to place you personal life on hold. Granted this is just the deal with public accounting and is not unique to KPMG. Wages are standard for public accounting but are low compared to industry positions, especially when total hours are factored in."
KPMG,1f3lqs0cjo29g800,4.0,"KPMG actually values their employees, though your management, compensation, and advancement do not actively reflect it. KPMG has 2 yearly shutdowns, one over Christmas, and the other over 4th of July for a paid week that doesn't count against your vacation time. Surprisingly weak on the benefits and pay side, it is a fun company to work at."
KPMG,1f3c9kjsmu3bc800,3.0,"There are plenty of opportunities to learn and advance in your career. Opportunities are boundless, but be prepared to work 50 hours every week. Things pop up often and management treats everything like a fire drill. Management bends to clients needs without thinking of the strain it puts on their employees."
KPMG,1f3bi9b4ju3bc800,4.0,KPMG feels like a family from the very beginning. Everyone is welcoming and willing to help you succeed whether you've been there for a month or for 20 years.
KPMG,1f2q0hnbj3ki8000,3.0,"KPMG doesn't have a very strong culture and limited opportunities to grow. Projects are not assigned based on skillset, and advancement in career is slow."
KPMG,1f2j0u7q8309g000,4.0,"Work life balance is practically non-existent, especially since transitioning to work from home. At this point, basically just trying to hang in there to get enough experience and leave as soon as possible just like most people."
KPMG,1f2cdvv623ki8000,4.0,Working in KPMG’s Deal Advisory space a can be fun and challenging. It all depends on the mindset with with you approach the task. The hours can be tough significantly impacting work life balance but if you have an awesome team you’ll very rarely feel it.
KPMG,1f2a7eua3him2800,4.0,All the staff and managers where great but busy season sucked working 60-100 hrs per week and lots of travel. Tons of company happy hrs and events. Great place to start a career and give you the upper-hand when applying to another job.
KPMG,1f24904oos798800,3.0,It’s a great place to start a career. Really enjoyed my peer group. The work/life balance does not exist. Definitely not compensated for the amount of overtime provided and very little flexibility.
KPMG,1f23qblf9u1v3800,2.0,KPMG is a meat grinder.   The 12 years I worked for them I never say one person retire.   The company gets rid of its aging workforce before they get a chance to retire with full benefits.    One of the worst companies I've ever been associated with.  While there I saw every person hired on with me let go through the years.  By the time the company forced early retirement on me at the age of 57 after 12 years of dedicated service everyone I knew at the company had be let go.   Not a secure place to work for long-term life planning.
KPMG,1f1ts5mfat4cq800,4.0,"The work can vary from fairly interesting to pretty mundane, but the thing that makes KPMG what it is are the people. That is definitely the best part about working here. Besides that, it is a high stress environment with long hours. Management does try to recognize performance though."
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1f1q1scjbu40q800,4.0,Audit is audit buts it’s the best of the B4 in my opinion.  Career coaches are usually very helpful and care about your growth.
KPMG,1f1o5jt25u40q800,3.0,"Long hours and work life balance is not always great. Schedule can change week to week/month to month due to nature of job. Didn't really have any say about what project you get placed on which isn't always great if you get stuck on a client engagement you don't enjoy. Good benefits and company perks, but pay should have been more compared to industry. People are frequently overworked and burnt out. Trainings were fun and learned a lot, especially when new. Great people - made some great friends. You do learn a ton though because you're forced to so it is a great way to quickly advance your career. There is high turnover at a lot of Big 4 companies."
KPMG,1f1k0o1fonph7800,5.0,"Working at KPMG was one of the most positive experiences I've had in my professional career. There was an open door policy between staff and management within my team, and the full-time KPMG workers. There didn't seem to be a hierchy among high skilled workers. Everyone maintained a culture of respect and inclusion. This was an amazing place to work."
KPMG,1f1eduppkt4q6800,5.0,Fun times with initial manager but not so happy with subsequent manager. Learn alot work hard to meet engagement deliverables and quality work products
KPMG,1f11jpmeqn53l800,2.0,Start your career there but get out quickly. Management recycle employees like water bottles.
KPMG,1f10bhbucs7jc800,1.0,"Didn't like my time in there, was a waste of time, bad management and a lot of ""you should know you could have done this"" when nobody explains anything to you"
KPMG,1f0tqrqpan54g800,4.0,Great place to start a career. Supportive environment which supplies the resources needed to learn and grow a career. So many opportunities especially for those that are driven.
KPMG,1f0i77rbanpl8800,3.0,"I'm just a intern in KPMG, but my co-worker(or supervisor) told me that they have to work very late so as to complete their assigned jobs. And the payment was just not pleasant."
KPMG,1f07k4o9du3jt800,3.0,"Great people to work with in most of the teams i have been on, stable job with predictable advancement from assoc to senior to manager to senior manager, but overall too many hours and not enough pay"
KPMG,1f03rvtfmu3jt800,4.0,Long hours and not compensated accordingly. However people are great to work with and learning at such a high pace. Great training is made available to all employees
KPMG,1evshiv1an52h800,4.0,Great place to get trained and build your career - tough hours but the trade off is worth it. Recommend you stay until senior associate at a minimum.
KPMG,1evq04tkfsa8h800,4.0,Really productive work environment. Hours can be long but only expected. Management listen to your concerns and make allowances if you ever need them.
KPMG,1evg5j6tnocao800,5.0,Great company to launchpad your company. There are numerous opportunities you can dive into or transfer into once you're in. Just do your part in selling yourself well.
KPMG,1euvna1b3npjs800,4.0,"Overall, a great place to be if you want your career to accelerate in high gear. That said, hours can be long, travel can be intense, and the advancement opportunities do create a competitive environment ."
KPMG,1euraptfs3h99000,2.0,"Management consulting not in focus, hence little motivation to work there, as silos mentality creates road blocker in own development within the consulting department."
KPMG,1eumregumo1i6800,2.0,"Despite National being very pro mental health and inclusive, I found the local office to be quite the opposite.  I have never been treated so poorly by a professional then I was at KPMG. My direct manager was unavailable and unwilling to listen or appreciate mental health concerns. No support offered which is really disappointing for the level of company.  Just a number not a person."
KPMG,1euj690kjo15p800,5.0,This is the typical big 4 experience. Long hours but worth your while at the beginning of your career.  You will learn a lot but you will get exhausted.
KPMG,1eub4f7353h8h000,1.0,"The firm does not have the Ability to execute a meaningful direction and strategy.  No sense of team or market leadership.  Partners have no interest in driving the business , only how will the be bonused each year."
KPMG,1eu3j2pgmn5b4800,3.0,A lot of time consuming tasks - normally performed by offshore teams
KPMG,1eu178r143kh5000,3.0,I enjoyed my time there. Many nice coworkers the work was efficient but the management team I did not care for. With the team I worked with they were for themselves and made it seem like they didn’t want to help and were annoyed easily
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1ettha6tiu312800,4.0,Interning for this company was interesting it was all online so it was tough to pick up information especially when unsure of everything going on in the first place
KPMG,1etnhbburosn9800,3.0,"The role has its benefits in terms of advancement, flexible hours during the offseason and benefits. However, the compensation is very rigid in terms of not differentiating for performance, as you can expect with a large corporation. It's hit and miss in terms of the how supportive your managers and partners can be."
KPMG,1et7bbisct52l800,4.0,I’ve been here 5 years now. It’s a great company no complaints. Pay is good and the work is interesting. Would recommend working here to others. The leadership is solid.
KPMG,1et3r9pbcpi26800,3.0,"Had fun as a recent undergrad and felt invested in. However, travel and unpredictable schedule was not sustainable.  Nonetheless, I learned a lot and enjoyed my time there."
KPMG,1eshc3u82s9uq800,4.0,"I really enjoy the jobs I am placed on and the people I work with. I think the firm does a good job advancing inclusion & diversity programs. One downfall is that I don’t feel compensated for the level of effort I put in, but they’re in the process of changing the way reviews are completed so I’m hopeful it’ll change."
KPMG,1es17nqodnplu800,3.0,This company gives you the opportunity to excel and grow depending on your position level. More potentials for staff level management than it is for admin assistants unless you have a 4-year degree and want to move into a staffing position.
KPMG,1erf7rkfasa99800,4.0,"Upper management is unrealistic and does not care for lower level employees, middle management is good but the great ones leave to go elsewhere, under paid for big 4."
KPMG,1ercbcae4sa99800,5.0,"Great people, easy commute, beautiful office.  Lots of perks. Volunteer time off which you are given many choices. Also free coffee and milk supplied by the office."
KPMG,1er7ulq2psa97800,3.0,Dogs are the best thing going for the company they are very fun and make the workplace much better to be in and make me want to come in everyday and never call out
KPMG,1eqmqpfuko2gt800,4.0,"Working hard from associate to senior to manager. There is a classic path to partner or you can hop out like so many do after a few years. Big clients, large engagements. Fast paced. Low pay for the hours."
KPMG,1eqlq6237u35m800,5.0,"Lots of training. Busy, fast paced atmosphere. Great diverse workplace where everyone was welcome. Sorry to leave there but I was laid off due to a COVID reduction in workforce."
KPMG,1eqif8ioqu49m800,1.0,"The firm has excellent benefits, but the culture is something to desire.  If you are not an Associate or above, you will not have a voice and often left out.  They speak on Inclusion and Diversity, but the numbers does not show that.  If you are a minority your chances on succeeding are slim to none.  Please take heed to this advice and do your due diligence before applying or accepting a job with this firm."
KPMG,1eq0dsehdu35m800,4.0,"Performance driven culture. Co workers are very supportive. Many opportunities to learn and good supportive managers and employees are very focused on their work. Since this is accounting, many employees work long hard hours during busy season but the company rewards well. The Short Hills office was a close-knit work culture."
KPMG,1eppqd4ngu35m800,2.0,Nothing special. No raise or bonus. Not much growth while working at this company. Not much support from management either. My team does have the ability to work from home which is nice.
KPMG,1epkide5ou23q800,1.0,"Good place to start great time family at work feel as home learn alot on the job , professional team members great benefits . alot of work , great bonus,"
KPMG,1epjpelc3u2nb800,3.0,"I would rate them 5 out of 5 for shelling out professionals. It’s like a production line. They pay good money to train you into a problem-killing machine. BUT in my humble opinion, it’s not worth the toll on your mental health. They’ll put a straw in you, and suck the life out of you, checking to make certain you’re not dead as they do so. Colleague died and got a minute of silence. We continued typing as we stood in “silence”. I quit, met all conditions, but the final emoluments never came. Don’t do it!"
KPMG,1epalcf7mu32a800,3.0,"Your experience will entirely depend on your engagement and/or team. You can be put on an absolute dumpster fire of a project and have a dreadful experience, or you can get put on an excellent project and end up wondering why some of your peers are so stressed and contemplating jumping off a bridge. I was fortunate to be put on a great project and have had an excellent experience thus far. Oth I have heard a couple of my fellow new hires have been put on terrible projects and I genuinely feel bad for them. The concerns i’ve heard are incompetent managers, Senior Associate with little to no accountability for the success of their new associates, and unusually long hours. Overall my experience has been a super positive one."
KPMG,1ep1ljlh0s7m1800,3.0,"Pros: Diversity, Technology, can work remote, health benefits + pto (day after thanksgiving off + closed christmas week), everyone at every level is issued a firm laptop"
KPMG,1eovd7lves7m1800,3.0,"1) Most days are very busy as you scale up in the organization and involve many hours of calls, work, review and deliverables."
KPMG,1eog558venpgr800,2.0,everything in the company needs to be changed. Management does not give room for people to grow and will not allow their careers to process to the level that they can.
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1eodd3glms78u800,2.0,KPMG treats anyone under an associate level like they are easily replaceable. There is no office culture or rapport and dedicated staff are severely underpaid. It is nearly impossible to get a promotion or hired for an internal position. I do not recommend this company to anyone who is under the associate level.
KPMG,1eo35lcdtt4kh800,2.0,Blame game
KPMG,1ent00i23npn0800,4.0,Love this company. it is a wonderful place to work and everyone work as a team in the company. I truly enjoy working there. I can get time off easily and get paid well for my job.
KPMG,1enqrovjlu1tu800,2.0,"KPMG Canada is supposed to be in the ''Big 4'' but is really running behind on others, they should really not be considered in the Big 4. Their audit technology is super old, their tools are not up to date and they have a real hard time doing the transition."
KPMG,1enlr73s2saas800,4.0,Best place to work so you learn and move on..you will have clients in different industries so you will get to know about how these companies are managed.That is a good advantage
KPMG,1enlcukehu2d6800,5.0,Work-life balance
KPMG,1enf1utncnpln800,5.0,"As an employee at KPMG you will have access to and interact with experts across industries and business solutions. At the same time you will be valued for the skills and expertise you bring to the table. It is truly a collaborative environment. KPMG also puts tremendous effort in curating a positive and balanced culture. The culture message is extremely well thought out and executed. Overall, a great place to work and learn."
KPMG,1enep3hdenpt1800,1.0,Satisfaction goes with what client you get put on and what partner you work for... Your partner can change the whole dynamic of the workplace - every engagement can act as it's own small entity.
KPMG,1en9ocmi2u1av800,5.0,Unlimited advancement opportunities
KPMG,1en8tocbes9u3800,5.0,KPMG's a great place to begin a career. You build a solid network and there is training for all analysts with regular social events. The culture has slightly deteriorated due to good people leaving but overall a good experience.
KPMG,1en2hv6ant51g800,2.0,"Toxic, toxic, toxic!  The people were nice but I could do without the brown-nosing and phony clique's. There's much better places to work with much better leadership and pay."
KPMG,1en0rrcd1o1no800,4.0,"pretty boring at times bc tasks can be very tedious, but it is a good place to gain accounting exp. having good co-workers really changes the atm so be on the look out for that"
KPMG,1emq69qclnptv800,5.0,You’re going to work a lot but having KPMG on your resume will set you for life in the world of corporate accounting.
KPMG,1eme6ee0inpup800,4.0,I was an auditor in Los Angeles and I did a lot of work with my team. It was very stressful and didn’t know what to do next. New staff theres a lot to do and hard
KPMG,1eluihmino16r800,5.0,The work life balance is great and there are always someone out there to guide you and lead you. Pay is good. Good career opportunities with competitive benefits.
KPMG,1elsuven1u2u5800,5.0,"At KPMG, be expected to work long hours.  In Hartford, CT, it seems to be on the upper spectrum of hours worked compared to other BIG 4 (EY might be worse).  If you are a decent performer, expect to be promoted on time, within 4.5 years you can be a manager making 100K - quick advancement and pretty common.  Learn quickly on the job."
KPMG,1elq49ea8u2u5800,4.0,KPMG is a great place to start your career.  Amazing opportunities.  Additionally they offer great training to get to get you started.  Managers are great.
KPMG,1eliruvl4npcn800,4.0,"Great company that cares about its interns. As an intern, you get exposed to different industries. I was rotated between three different clients in different industries."
KPMG,1elbahdceu1cn800,5.0,I loved working for KPMG! I started entry level and stayed for 3 years. I left because I felt that I wasn't seen as more then this entry level role and didn't feel I would be able to move to different departments and excel. I did make a lateral move to the NYC office and I REALLY liked the job but just wasn't making enough money.  So I sadly left to get more experience elsewhere. I do wish there was more opportunity to move and be seen even though I had such an entry level support role.
KPMG,1el9tlc17s7ic800,5.0,Work-life balance
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1el496akdu1qi800,4.0,"KPMG is an amazing place to begin your career, extremely supporting company depending on the service, only qualm would be the pay. but you get the chance to work on various projects which definitely aids your growth"
KPMG,1ekvau9krnph9800,2.0,"It is a great place to learn, but managers does not appreciatte your sacrifices. Poor staff organization and no coordination. Salary is not enough for all the hours you work."
KPMG,1ekjpk39pu1t7800,5.0,"It is a public accounting firm, so there is inherent dissatisfaction. Beyond that, KPMG was a great place to work. I enjoyed my coworkers and a good majority of management."
KPMG,1ekf2q6l13o7v000,4.0,"At least in my area of expertise and within my team, I felt I had plenty of exposure to a variety of different kinds of work under different managers. I think this is a great thing for entry level workers who may not know exactly what they want to do with their careers. Longer run, in consulting you need to become more specialized to stay in, but for a first job out of college I would recommend KPMG. However, the culture of each team and line of business can vary greatly, which one should also keep in mind."
KPMG,1ek70a950u3t5800,4.0,Almost 15 years with KPMG and with this virus stuff continuing they had to make some hard choices and I was one of them otherwise I would still be working there.
KPMG,1ek25j6sp3o71000,4.0,People are great to work with.  Business margin pressures lead to lot of cost cutting and restricting.  Senior management changes every 5 years so changes are always occurring for both good and bad.
KPMG,1ejvtgv5ou3cj800,4.0,"KPMG is proud to be a diverse professional firm.  I worked with some great people and served clients in a number of industries.  Because of some specialized knowledge, I was able to work on special project outside of my region."
KPMG,1ejtqjtirnpdo800,4.0,"It is great place to start your career, but you must remember you can be placed on multiple busy seasons back to back. Once that occurs it's easy  to realize how underpaid the staff is."
KPMG,1ejtfa80ss78h800,4.0,I had a really great internship experience at KPMG! The managers were really supportive as well as the associates I worked with in ensuring that I understood the work that I was doing.
KPMG,1ejlbd1fku1l6800,1.0,"I started off with the firm on an outstanding note for about a year (despite lack of pay for grueling work and exhausting hours and utter disregard for work / life balance).  When I transitioned to a new engagement, I received next to no training for my position.  This set me up for failure immediately, especially as a recent graduate just beginning my career.  I was told repeatedly by colleagues that I did not belong with KPMG because I didn't major in business or accounting. Due to frequent questioning and doubts as to why I'm apart of the firm, I struggled feeling a sense of belonging.  My manager was very unprofessional, who micromanaged and forwarded me emails containing catty, negative discussions between other colleagues about me."
KPMG,1ejiccdels7hg800,5.0,Great place to work with an office hoteling concept. The firm is very responsive to the employees work/life needs and the salary is great. I highly recommend KPMG as one of the best places I have worked.
KPMG,1eje03g3tu3pg800,3.0,This job stressed me. I worked very long hours and with little recognition for it. It’s great that they pay for meals and transportation but they work you very hard for not as nearly the same amount in pay.
KPMG,1ej182rdusqbl800,5.0,great company with amazing benefits...i wish i never lost the job smh. i reall missed working there. ppl are nice and they have the best HR who protect their employees.
KPMG,1eip7ib9gsqbl800,3.0,"You are expected to put in 50-60 hours per week, including weekends. You expect to have to put in extra time on occasion to deal with a schedule issue or an emergency. They do not add staff when there is too much work, they expect you to take the time out of your personal life to fill in the gaps."
KPMG,1eiodles1sqbl800,5.0,- KPMG does Agile development which works great for their team dynamic.
KPMG,1eilsa54qsqbl800,4.0,It's just like they tell you.
KPMG,1eijkaj24olck800,4.0,I wish I could have continued to work with kpmg. I have got good exposure till the time I work with. Good place to work. I feel Kpmg cares employees like a baby.
KPMG,1eihdafqqof3u800,1.0,"Nothing was good, absolutely hated this company. Too much work, seniors who were cut throat and would literally curse at you, favoritism, lack of diversity, too many Type A personalities. Run!!!"
KPMG,1eifgq4npsqbl800,5.0,Overall
KPMG,1eifci1a1sqbl800,4.0,Good benefits
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1eid8fpmsree1800,5.0,A great place to work. Colleagues are bright. Managers are held to a high bar for values. I would recommend. They are people-focused and care about employees.
KPMG,1eicpb6qtof3u800,3.0,"I learned a lot of relevant information however it came at the cost of long hours during busy season (i.e., 70+ hours) and continuous stress. Seems to be a place where you fall in line rather than be yourself."
KPMG,1eia7bk60of3u800,3.0,This place will make you feel like your career is at the forefront for learning and growing which is great. The only sacrifice is that you have no work-personal life balance.
KPMG,1ei9ped1iu1dj800,5.0,I have no complaints over starting my career at KPMG. I lasted three years until a senior auditor and left to pursue internal audit knowing the skills I took with me would be valuable.
KPMG,1ei9lj3jusqbl800,4.0,Great culture and environment.  People are very kind on all levels up to management. Long hours and heavy deadlines but communications is great during this time and multiple opportunities.
KPMG,1ehqc7krnro7r800,3.0,I worked at KPMG full-time for more than 10 years
KPMG,1egp1tvje3cfd000,2.0,"Busy season lasted about 6/7 months as I was tossed from one busy season client to the next. The most hours I worked in a week was 80 hours, which was awful. Managers expect you to put work first without saying it out right. Pay and bonuses are less than I thought they would be."
KPMG,1efjb6oeaol7u800,3.0,- Good PTO plan
KPMG,1efgr0299oetj800,1.0,Plan on performing repetitive tasks ad nauseam for years on  end.  Incompetent management only out to save themselves.  Many co-workers are not trustworthy.  Not a good place to work unless you hate life.
KPMG,1ef0383hercmp800,4.0,The pay was good even when coronavirus pay cuts occurred. My coworkers were pretty cool I just didn't like my boss. The director of security needs to be replaced. He literally drains the life out of the company. Other than that great company fair pay.
KPMG,1eenulfa7r4sg800,3.0,KPMG is a great place to start your career. It’s a huge resume builder and every day is different. There are many opportunities to learn and grow. Unfortunately there’s no work life balance and you may have to juggle multiple clients at once. There are also so many new required work papers within the last year but you don’t get any more time allocated to complete these. Jobs can be very understaffed as well.
KPMG,1eedkvtjppjmm800,4.0,Kpmg is a great place to start a career and advance quickly. The skills you develop are useful in any future role.  The environment is fast paced and client service driven.
KPMG,1edu7ii97s37k800,5.0,"The culture and ambient are great at KPMG, the workload is heavy but you get support from your peers. If you work as a project manager there will be tremendous amount of overtime and pressure to deliver; on the positive side, if you are an employee you get paid furlough  twice a year, last week and first week in January and two weeks in July."
KPMG,1edng6g73oe0j801,4.0,"The people that you work with on a project will make or break your experience at the firm. The firm keeps cutting down employee benefits during difficult times, but never increase them back afterwards. Job security is pretty good though."
KPMG,1ed811ba2osed800,4.0,This was the second time in the past several years that they have laid off employees due to outsourcing to India  and Mexico.  The job growth isn't at par with other companies.
KPMG,1ed7ti9f2pvi3800,5.0,The work environment is full of opportunities in various Accounting fields.Lots of trainings are provided for employees.It a safe working environment.
KPMG,1ed759b2are1l800,5.0,"You have feeling work-life balance. Great environment with well skilled work team. Good salary, and compensation. People work at KPMG for yrs and even retire."
KPMG,1eciu34imoear800,1.0,"If you value your career, and understand your career is short and experience is valuable, don’t waste the years where you could and should be working with competent management"
KPMG,1ebuguh7kpc6g800,4.0,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at KPMG. However, this was mainly because of the greatest coworkers and perks given. It truly felt like family. KPMG had many loyal coworkers who were passionate, optimistic, and inclusive. KPMG allows a great employee experience. Benefits and perks are ideal. The one downside to KPMG was the lack of management. Some PMLs need more mandatory, formal trainings. They are not flexible as far as work life balance, there is evident micro-managing, and many employees will attest that it is challenging to get promoted even when demonstrating results and excellent performance. It's discouraging especially for the younger employees and associates who came in at an already low salary and are eager to learn more and grow. If things don't change, the new or younger employees will not remain loyal. If management and leadership really focus on career development and flexibility, KPMG would be perfect. Hoping to return to KPMG one day with more experience and help make an impact!"
KPMG,1ebf0qf0crg9n800,2.0,Blame game
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1e9mnp1u0qvcq800,3.0,"The people who work at KPMG are great to work for and with, the work itself is typical audit work for large clients. You learn a lot but are underpaid and overworked."
KPMG,1e9459tjr3046000,5.0,"A very friendly staff with a great environment, a place like you want to say I’m home, very good schedule and pay. A great place to work for ever. Good people with always smile to help you whenever you need"
KPMG,1e8teosmh4tq1800,5.0,"My team at KPMG were total pros - colleagues who combined mastery of their subject matter with high social intelligence and collegiality.  I was pushed hard at KPMG but never overtly.  Rather, the incentive to strive was to keep up with the hard working and very intelligent colleagues and contribute to team success."
KPMG,1e8pmoss2oaig800,2.0,You must love what you do otherwise you will burn out quickly.  Busy season can be very stressful and often times personalities clash due to high demands and low guidance/direction from management.
KPMG,1e8mmhicjotfn800,4.0,"Overall, I had a good time working with KPMG. The culture is amazing, the employee and manager collaboration and support is very strong. There is definitely favoritism played toward Audit/Tax/Advisory"
KPMG,1e8j342vlnofa800,5.0,"Great company to work for many reasons. You get the experience of working in various business environments. The a manager assigns you to various audits. You report to a supervisor, who in tern reports to a manager. The manager reports to the audit partner."
KPMG,1e87djbh9ouf8800,4.0,Great place to start off your career. The experience you will get is unmatched however the hours are not ideal at all. You will work 50-60 hours weeks On your salary and you will work a lot of weekends as well. The work life balance is their biggest pitfall other than that it is a great place to work.
KPMG,1e7r6hpu534fl000,1.0,Learned the organization and my manager did not live the principals they claim and espouse.  Culture shock had previously worked for a highly principled organization that walked the talk.  Not the case at KPMGwalked
KPMG,1e7mi8rp4ov18800,4.0,"Culture is driven by the practice leaders - the environment is set by the partner, which can be a good or bad thing. Good place to start your career, but a small but noticeable step down from the Big 4 leaders."
KPMG,1e7md5t6joaq2800,4.0,Pros:

KPMG,1e76jkaaeotfj800,5.0,Big four was not for me. I did not like the culture or the on boarding process. I felt like I was handed a computer and told to go audit a multi billion dollar public company with no guidance.
KPMG,1e73a1pmb4rj2800,5.0,"I very much enjoyed working at KPMG, Although I was only a contractor.  The work environment was wonderful with great management.  Wish I could have stayed longer, however COVID had other plans."

KPMG,1e5veiv3qotp9800,4.0,"Great Managers and great team whom inspire, encourage you to be your best as well as reward those that do an exceptional job! great PTO time too and holiday vacation time as the firm shuts down so you have time off to spend with family -- they encourage it. Respect, integrity, diversity, fair, rewarding - best place to work hands down."
KPMG,1e5snltomo9i3800,3.0,"This was a very interesting company to work for with lots of exciting projects.  But my area did not have a lot of work to do at times, in other areas there was quite a large amount of work to do, but not all were trained or allowed to do these things.  Found management to be aloof and    there was a limit to group bonding, you were basically on your own all the time almost.  Directions were given too many times verbally and through non-written non-official documents and ways, this made things very confusing and difficult.  On balance was a ""good place to work"" just had many challenges to get past."
KPMG,1e5ortnmfhbon800,5.0,"one of the strongest pillars most organizations rely upon, their existence is unshakable and their quality of services is one of the best. I will like to recommend it to any company that wants the best audit."

KPMG,1e4k9bcisp3rl801,5.0,The manager is so helpful in each task assigned to the team. My manager is very systematic and disciplined. I learned a lot working under her guidance.
KPMG,1e4cfm91goc8o802,1.0,"Management was unfair and racist. The company has great perks but if they don’t like you, it’s impossible to move up or change departments. If I had more support I would of never left the company."
KPMG,1e43k53rrhc22802,3.0,"Pushed out of organization when spouse became sick with cancer. No understanding of personal tragedy, just ""your performance is slipping"" get the work done faster."
KPMG,1e3t61lq7o21v802,4.0,I can say this was a good job for me I mainly had it because of the fact that I was required to work one day out of the week at a company and they placed me here for a 2 years and I honestly liked it.
KPMG,1e3qoo15jocam802,3.0,"I got the job offer after my internship back to the time i was still in school. This is my first job out of college. I am still proud of myself to make to Big4. If you are student and looking for review for one of a Big4, remember that if you choose Big4, you have to know in mind that working long hours, 2-3 busy seasons/ year are just normal thing. You will learn as you go. Now, I realize that many companies are looking to hire people from Big4 or they all came from Big4."
KPMG,1e3o18m08oc9v800,4.0,Decent place to work. Great people that will help you throughout your career. You advance quickly if you're a high performer. Work-life balance is a fairytale.

KPMG,1e3fuesbqo27k802,3.0,Generally a good company but the management team I reported into was flaky and I couldn't trust them. I was a contractor there and one evening they called my recruiter and cancelled my contract with out a direct word to me.
KPMG,1e3an6lgaoc8p805,5.0,"KPMG has a rich history and a system that is comprised of carefully placed values that will develop employees as a professional. Many people can't stand the pressure. They blame the pressure on people, work, and system. Nevertheless, if you learn to work with the pressure and allocate those pressures into personal development of character, you will find yourself appreciated in the work place."
KPMG,1e3613oqjq30v802,2.0,"I don’t doubt that experience for consultants isn’t bad, but the back office BPG jobs here are god awful - think admin/ resource management, EMC, marketing, HR, recruiting, etc.  middle managers skate by doing nothing.  Raises are non existent."

KPMG,1e2jkhl65o2hd802,2.0,"Pleasant physical environment with very little interaction with management. The job itself is very predictable, routine with no variety- borderline robotic. The hardest part of the job is sitting in a seat all day long, with no option to telecommute and no interaction with other people."
KPMG,1e2j896jghael803,3.0,"If you can look beyond the bi-annual fear of having your role outsourced, the constant cost cutting measures, and the lack of raises and promotions this could be a phenomenal place to work."

KPMG,1e1uqfk5lq2u5801,4.0,"Working at KPMG is a great place to establish yourself in the financial world and will open the doors to many future opportunities. Unfortunately, these benefits and opportunities come at a high cost of time and resources. Big 4 accounting companies ask a lot of lower-level employees and do not compensate them accordingly. If you can sacrifice many aspect of your life to put in the time at a big 4 accounting firm, it will pay dividends in the future, but is not preferable when actually involved with the company."

KPMG,1e1sfi081olq3803,3.0,"KPMG thrives on young talent, there is no doubt. However, it becomes clear how much they take advantage of their employees (only after people start dropping like flies). Pay is also ~25% below market value -- you can do better."

You are given lots of responsibilities even after just 2 years at the firm. You have the privilege of exploring several companies .You have the opportunity to meet CEOs, MDs, CFOs you probably only hear of in the news. It coul be stressful but its worth it."
KPMG,1e14r8qn0hc11801,5.0,1.  Loved the job and people I supported.
KPMG,1e0nrbqgjh6ls802,4.0,Same as the rest of Big 4.  You work a lot and learn a lot and then decide how long you want to stay in public accounting.  I don't think they are ahead or behind any of the other firms.  Individual experiences will vary more due to clients/location than differences within the firms themselves.

KPMG,1e07hrfkjobp4805,1.0,"This KPMG office in Silicon Valley has a first year associate turn over rate of over 50% within the first year. That means 50% of the first-year employees quit before their year is up. Recruitment for this company is a scam. They lure you in with the promise of internal growth and job stability. However, all you receive as a first year is torturous hours, minimal compensation (when you finally do the math), and little to no guidance or support. The recruiters deserve Oscars. They are great at their job. They paint a picture of elitism and success. They convince college students into believing they will be entering the business and accounting world on top. They tell you that you will be working a couple hours later than usual during a busy season that lasts 1-2 months. The reality is that these students are crushed into accepting a sub-par lifestyle that devalues them as human beings. Any free-spirit they have going into this job is obliterated. In order to continue working here, one must accept an ideology in which their time means nothing. I have and will continue to warn individuals exploring employment at this office. I will tell them the truth. The ""busy season"" that lasts ""1-2 months"" is a lie. You can get assigned to a second, maybe even a third. The ""extra couple hours"" is also a lie. Try leaving at 11PM after working through lunch and dinner and not being provided a single break. The management bears no responsibility. The environment is not one of support and guidance. Rather there is resentment and irritation at a beginner's inability to perform a task they were never"

KPMG,1e0362oioq3n1801,1.0,They work you to death day and night - work life balance is an issue.  Management is awful and doesn’t listen to your requests sir time off.  Time off is not really time off your still working.

KPMG,1dvjom0bvo1hc803,2.0,Company often values profits over people when it comes time for bonuses/raised; often only leadership is rewarded for their efforts.  The hardest part of the job is often getting the work required done with the resources provided.

KPMG,1dr6oefbs24f2005,4.0,I thoroughly enjoy the company culture at KPMG. The managers are extremely intelligent and are more-than willing to put down their work for 20 minutes to help teach/explain a concept. The busy season prepares you to solidify concepts and conceptually grasp what an audit truly means. I have learned an incredible amount while working here.
KPMG,1dr6j5acd24ei001,4.0,"KPMG has a great company culture. They work incredibly hard to make new employees feel like the work you has meaning. They pay very well, but the work can become a drag."

KPMG,1dqusoa4qh3io800,5.0,As expected by its reputation as one of the Big4. The smallest and probably the most laid back of the 4. The people there are sophisticated yet caring.

KPMG,1dqqg8mhl5naa802,1.0,"Good for your career advancement early on in your career, but try to leave after 3 years if you can make it that long for your resume  Extremely demoralizing, horrible management. Negativity is rampant in this office, they will put you down no matter how much work you put in. They will put as much work on you as possible, without thanking you or compensating you accordingly. Good learning experience. Just be forewarned of the office politics, keep to yourself, and hack it as long as you can, then leave for a company that respects and compensates you"

KPMG,1dq9slc66h46a801,2.0,I wasted a year here with my boss encouraging people to not work with me. Selling air and lots of politics.  It was an experiment that those of us working the plan didn’t know. People fight over their share of commissions and guard their territory and customers with a deadly force. Depressing offering help to people that don’t want it.
KPMG,1dq8jufvoh3ua80a,5.0,One of the best best best work life experience. I didn't like that the pay was not market competitive but one of the best work life balance and company culture.
KPMG,1dq58cag85n9t801,2.0,"The office I was in has really taken a bad turn over the last 2 years. About a quarter of the group I was in quit since the summer, and more are planning to. One of KPMG's core values is open and honest communication, but they don't give honest communication regarding feedback or promotions. After getting fed up with inconsistent feedback I looked into other firms. Ended up at another firm, making a lot more money, and feeling like I am appreciated. Every aspect of the other firm has been better - disappointed that I waited to make the jump."

KPMG,1dpjnodukh461800,4.0,The experience you gain is very invaluable. I have learned to work under-pressure and have fun at the same time.  The work environment is very conducive for better productivity. We were even provided with a lounge and a TV for hosting clients and for relaxing.

KPMG,1doc03b35h41a802,4.0,Work/life balance can be lopsided but that's the nature of consulting industry. KPMG's workplace culture is welcoming and you can bring your authentic self to work.
KPMG,1do9qairjb8a6804,3.0,Great place to learn skills fast.  It's a very sink-or-swim environment and some managers make great lifeguards that will help you learn and succeed...some do not.
KPMG,1dnno83l7h3le802,3.0,"Excellent for working parents; work-life balance. Very different cultural experience for client-facing professionals, vs. support teams. The Communications dept. has been unstable for years; lack of leadership and consistency toward the firm strategy."

KPMG,1dn5h8dvk0mcg00b,5.0,I was at KPMG for a number of years. It was a good starting point but ultimately not somewhere I wanted to stay. There was a lot of opportunities to move around the company which I took and that gave me a well rounded experience.
KPMG,1dn3aslkjh3p0802,4.0,"I feel like KPMG is a great company. However, I think in my current position there is an expectation that you work regardless of whether you should be working at that time. I feel like I cannot truly disconnect and recharge. Then when I do return there is almost a guilt trip feeling for taking my time off. I don’t feel like it promotes a good working culture."
KPMG,1dn13fqrp5nbu804,4.0,"KPMG offers a work-life balance. Process and metrics heavy are detrimental to the Agile process. Mix experience with work culture, get cooperation from colleagues and team members. Management is becoming process heavy and business value is getting sideline."

KPMG,1dmufu47fh451801,4.0,"Overall, KPMG is a great place to work. It invests on training for all employees and makes an effort to improve the workplace. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with toxic people but I guess that's everywhere."
KPMG,1dmq65pgth3gu802,1.0,"The firm has become very harsh on its employees.  After working endless nights for years, I confronted my manager about a promotion and it does not seem to be in the cards.  Honest pay for hard work does not seem to be an option for this place anymore"

KPMG,1dkgssceb5j64805,4.0,"My experience was solely based on my partner/managing director. So really whoever interviews and signs your paycheck is the management you will be getting. The firm overall is great, it really cares about its employees. But you will not work with most of the people you see, and really the relationships you have with your managers are the ones that really count comes performance review time. KPMG is very money oriented and it shows through the interactions with clients and management. Accounting, audit, and advisory at the end of the day revolve around sales, and you are the asset that drives that goal."

KPMG,1digee686h46o800,4.0,If you work in Advisory chances are you travel. And travel usually means you do it Monday through Thursday every week.

They will tell you if you leave how big of a mistake you are making but they never left and don't know anything else. DO NOT listen to them. You leaving only hurts them and their current way of life. If they lose you, they have to work harder and replace you. They do not care about your career and it is everyone for themselves. If you remember and live by that, you should be fine."

KPMG,1ddj4cla824gh000,3.0,"I needed a job after I was laid off and they hired me. I'm still currently working here and so far everything's fine. It's not over the top wonderful, but it's also not the worst job I've ever had."
KPMG,1ddj16v0524ej000,1.0,"In a nutshell, DO NOT WORK HERE!"

The work can be demanding and tough, but the value you receive and amount you learn on the job is well worth the time invested. KPMG does a good job trying to give each employee the flexibility to maintain proper work life balance, though long hours are unavoidable. I believe KPMG has a great culture, and really cares about their work and the clients we serve."
KPMG,1dd8vbrifh3j5800,3.0,"Contractors in KTECH NJ are not offered the chance to join the firm as associates. For some reason be it incentives or what have you, St. Louis seems to be their priority. While I was with the firm I saw hard working contractors with tons or experience and who could have done wonders for the firm being let go after a very suspicios 2 year limit. This dilutes the knowledge base and they have to constantly train new contractors. This only occurs in NJ. St. Louis seems to have an unlimmited budget alloted as people start there as contractors and suddenly are brought in as FTEs( Full Time Employees ) regardless of seniority, Once you are in the sky is the limit. People get promoted quickly for whatever reason. However again, this only happens in their secondary location in St. Louis. So if you want to move to the MidWest please feel free. If you are in the NY/NJ area strap on for two years of no benefits , PTO , anything. You will NOT get anywhere and you will be given a nice bye bye after you put in your time, sweat and tears, Watch others advance because of where they live."

KPMG,1dck49kce52u0800,3.0,"KPMG really tries to foster good working culture.  However, in 2019 the culture in IT areas are very toxic due to some reorg and such.

This is my opinion of the immediate areas within my responsibilities.  It may be different in audit/tax/advisory areas."

I wouldn't trade my KPMG days for anything professionally!!"
KPMG,1dc5llu645nck800,4.0,Not bad overall. Bottom line rules but there are some concessions to humanness. Salary and benefits decent. Workspace is getting less private with stations and replacing cubes and offices. You could do worse.

KPMG,1d9slegk55j4j800,1.0,"KPMG is the worst place I ever worked. They had week one trainings but that was it. I was a first year and sent to do an audit by myself. I had one day in a year of working there where I was sitting next to a senior manager who actually talked to me about the auditing I was doing. You are on your own there and expected to work insane hours - jobs started at 8 and regularly worked until 10:30 or midnight. Leaving was the best decision. One person I started with said it the best - “This job has negatively impacted every relationship in my life”. You can learn more, work less, earn more, be happier and live longer somewhere else."
KPMG,1d9dm3u66b81j800,5.0,"There were flexible hours where assignments and deadlines were given and I was allowed to accomplish those under my own direction. Guidance was provided as needed.

KPMG,1d8n84e2sb890800,3.0,"KPMG is a great place to start your carerr, but isn't ideal longterm. There is very little work/life balance, and the company is not concerned with this problem at all. So, there;s not a lot an employee can do to improve it. You learn a lot, but it's hard work."

The days can be long and there are times that will require working over the weekend.

Many times as a manager you end up filling the Senior Associate , Manager and Director Role."
KPMG,1d8j86osb5j5g800,3.0,"KPMG on the whole is a solid firm with lots of smart, talented people. My own experience within the group formerly known as KTech left a good bit to be desired though. Aftershocks from last years’ reorganization continue to be felt, resulting in territorial disputes and backstabbing and a pervasive sense of impermanence. When will the next shoe drop, and why should I stick around long enough to get caught in the crossfire?"

KPMG,1d7ephs8e1d12000,2.0,"Not the worst company to work for, not the greatest. They like to say that you ""own your career"" here, but my experience has been that my career owned me. Career advancement advice was not given to me at all in my first 3 years and I had to figure everything out on my own. My PML's were absolutely horrible. By the time I got promoted, almost 5 years into my career, all of my colleagues had already been promoted twice and it was humiliating to be promoted to a level that all my coworkers literally started at. I had to finally tell myself enough is enough and leave."

KPMG,1d07u9dd51ahv001,5.0,Great place to start and grow your career with exposure to complex and interesting projects. Downside is that hours can be long with significant travel (depending on project).
KPMG,1d07phonl0mtf000,5.0,Overall friendly work environment. Pleasant surroundings. Diverse workforce.  Training courses provided to all employees no matter what your title/ position is. Approachable management within most departments.
KPMG,1d07l956l1aie000,1.0,"This was a short contract position.  On my first day there, my manager literally screamed at me in front of co-workers.  It only went downhill from there.  I finally picked up and left after 2 months of being abused"

KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1cv6a6h7c0kbv000,4.0,I'm the kind of person who knows how to execute difficult tasks with precision. I pay attention to all the details of a project. I make sure that every task is just right and that it is completed in a timely manner.
KPMG,1cv4559hg0mte000,2.0,"KPMG is a great place to work. The environment is suited for a person who like to be challenged and who's not afraid of change. Most days are very different from the prior day. If you have the right/experienced management, this can be a career that you would want to stay in for awhile. Although work-life balance can be a challenge in this envirnoment, strong work relationships are ususally built with your team."
KPMG,1cv3jta641aid000,3.0,Learned 5 years of business for every one year worked.  Fast paced.  Very rewarding if you only like work and want to be a Partner.  TOugh to have older kids and work there.

KPMG,1cv2134p31ahl000,3.0,Its OK to work here. Sometimes it is very hard and sometimes it is cool. Not too much to complain about. Salary is ok but not great. Growth is limited
KPMG,1cutfnd810mto000,1.0,Middle management did not know how to handle their business. Older employees are held to much lower standards. The culture is toxic. Managers and superiors have no qualms about throwing their admins or in-charges under the bus. Very cut-throat.
KPMG,1cuknkk8r1fdl000,4.0,Experienced associates are held to a higher standard and are expected to perform at KPMG's level from day 1. Every mistake is scrutinized heavily. So have your game face ready
KPMG,1cud3sm8h0mt7000,4.0,"Since it is an audit firm, there is a lot of deadlines to provide Audit and Financial reports."
KPMG,1cu2e4hepas3d801,2.0,"I have worked as a contractor in an administrative position for the past 8 months.  This would be a great place to work for anyone who is a direct hire.  As a contractor, you are barely seen or heard.  The environment is pleasant, the people are professional and the work is manageable.  But KPMG only treats it's own employees with respect, not so much for the contractors."
KPMG,1ctvcmspd0mtm000,4.0,Enjoyable but stressful.  Administrative management offsite and difficult to to feel appreciated.  Felt undervalued.
KPMG,1cttrlufuakbr800,4.0,"KPMG is a great place to work.  I was employed there for 22 years, and was fortunate to have opportunities to work in various positions while I was there.   I made a great number of friends while employed there..."
KPMG,1ctt5hk490mtl000,1.0,"Very cut-throat work environment. They do not give you necessary training to advance skills. If task isn't done 100% correctly the first time, it is held against you. But looks good on resume for when you are looking to leave."

KPMG,1csd8n7aebrff800,3.0,"I was a summer intern and the managers and peers were great. They were really kind and wanted to see me grow. However, the work may not be the most exciting and was also kind of slow."
KPMG,1cs9ih8pbbrf8800,3.0,"Good place to start career, learn a lot fast and lots of options to learn and get promoted. However it's unsustainable and burn out happens fast. Pay is abysmal for the amount you work."
KPMG,1crqclt7gb87f800,3.0,The commute beat me down. I did not enjoy the work environment or culture. Everyone seems to be a robot with little interest in outside activities besides accounting.
KPMG,1crq79dl3b87f800,5.0,"Great Experience, simply exploring opportunities in other fields outside of cyber security. looking to leverage previous work experience. Also looking internally at KPMG"

KPMG,1cro2vu9l5nb8800,4.0,No 2 days are the same and the people make all the difference. Great vacation benefits and both 401K and pension.  Work life balance is a challenge especially during key times of the year.
KPMG,1crgv2l1v5j6j800,3.0,The hours during busy season in one week can be over 90 hours. During non peak seasons weekly hours are expected to be 40-50 hours. Anytime PTO that is to be taken needs to be signed off on by all team managers.
KPMG,1crfck2715j6j800,4.0,"Employees are provided with depth of experience and exposed to leaders in a large range of industries, and provided with opportunities to grow constantly."

KPMG,1crd945l25nev800,3.0,"This is a good firm to get into if you have no other options and need to have a brand name on your resume. Otherwise, get your resume bulked up and get out. There is no opportunity to develop your career the way that you want to. The work-life balance is absolutely awful and the pay makes that fact even worse. Much better off with Deloitte if anything."
KPMG,1cras4351ake6800,3.0,I enjoyed working for this compnay because I was able to gain legal skills and experience in the corprate arena. I was able to utize these skills to get future employment in my field.

KPMG,1cr3cbv415j6i800,4.0,I enjoyed my time working at KPMG.  I worked for senior management in the Financial Services area.  Direct contact with Senior Partners.  I was rewarded for my efforts with raises.
KPMG,1cr32pg1q5j6i800,3.0,Long hours

KPMG,1cqop4gh5b86v800,3.0,"This job stinks and everyone knows it.  You pay your dues and work ridiculous hours.  That's then gig.  You learn a lot, and most of the people suck, but whatever, it gets you where you need to go."
KPMG,1cqol5e3mb8an800,5.0,SUMMARY OF EXPERIENCE
KPMG,1cqntnisk5nao800,5.0,"Exceptionally positive environment to work. Excellent career progression and good pay. Lot of opportunities for growth and development, effective appraisal process and development"
KPMG,1cqkdvua152uq800,2.0,Required long work hours and the hardest part was lack of training. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers. We learned a lot through on-the-job training and co-workers helping each other.
KPMG,1cqg7lpme5j6b800,4.0,Many types of opportunities available
KPMG,1cq9hsalobrec800,4.0,I was an employee at KPMG for over 9 years and enjoyed most of my time there.  There were instances where I felt I was unappreciated but left that position when I did.
KPMG,1cq4a4amu5j67800,4.0,"As an audit intern, I has very challenging projects and work, but the teams I was a part of were always willing to explain concepts to me."
KPMG,1cpvs66qc5neb800,3.0,Great perks and flexibility.  There is also room for growth and advancement.  The company cares about its employees and is about work life balance and volunteering
KPMG,1cpv2rdl85j64800,4.0,Great place to work. Team was professional and internal clients were engaged. Work/Life balance depends on the team on which a person worked. No work/life balance on this particular team.
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1cpt433gj5j64800,4.0,Its a very competitive and thriving culture. The hours can be very challenging especially in tax and audit positions however you have many benefits such as flexibility to work from home as long as it fits the business model you are working in. They offer great medical and dental plans and you can contribute to a 401(k) which is great for your future.
KPMG,1cpsel9nkas1p800,2.0,"Working for one of the Big 4 is a very challenging adventure, I'm convinced it's a very good school to develop technical skills, but it would get in the middle of a balanced life"
KPMG,1cppjv9biakdm800,4.0,"KPMG was my first job out of college.  For a CPA starting a career, I couldn't have asked for a better company.  The work was challenging and rewarding.  Management was excellent and provided significant support in the advancement of my career.  Through the variety of clients I worked on, I gained invaluable experience across a variety of industries that I use to this day.  The workplace culture was professional, dedicated and truly enjoyable."
KPMG,1cpnqr1s7b82f801,4.0,"How well you end up liking the company depends on which department you are in and who you work for.  They claim to have flexible work schedules and the ability to work from home, but that is not true throughout the entire organization.  Most people tend to work long hours while others in the same department don't.  Sometimes a manager's perception is distorted on who is busy or who is the most productive."
KPMG,1cpnagff452uf800,5.0,In almost every work place the team/coworkers can make or break ones experience there. While at KPMG I had the pleasure of working with be best team imaginable. I would definitely work there again
KPMG,1cpk0j4q55nab800,5.0,An organization providing you the opportunities to:
KPMG,1cpibbmvd52uf800,4.0,same as bearing point
KPMG,1cpd4cer15na5800,4.0,I started there directly from there and was promoted five times during that period.  I learned a great deal during those early years of my career.  I believe those experiences were crucial to allow me to achieve what I have to date.
KPMG,1cpcsqbrlak68800,2.0,Typical large entity exhausting staff and promoting only certain desirable staff.  Just a stepping stone out to the real world for most of us.  No true value or lessons learned; no mentoring or serious attention to education on the job training.
KPMG,1cpapccegakhe800,1.0,"A typical day at work was answering phone calls, directing clients to the appropriate auditor or associate staff, provide administrative assistance by composing invoices, meeting minutes, letters, time and expense reporting, composing and coordinating travel arrangements and meetings. I did not learn much because the staff spent most of their days at client sites working on their books but when they were in the office that is when I was provided administrative tasks. The workplace culture was extremely competitive and therefore created a hostile environment. Not only were the auditors very disrespectful to me, the management did nothing to improve their treatment of me and allowed it to continue. He himself was not very respectful to me. The hardest part of the job was pleasing the staff. They are very high maintenance, unappreciative and display an entitlement attitude. The most enjoyable part of my job was having the opportunity to make arrangements for the office to participate in community events and show their interest in helping others."
KPMG,1cpaiao09aka2800,5.0,"This was an exciting job, big projects, fast paced, learning and transitioning with new clients. Could have travel or general placement, many options. Great opportunities for IT professionals. The hardest part of the job was not being in an office normally and not really knowing others in your line of command. The most enjoyable part was getting to meet new clients, build relationships and stay really busy."
KPMG,1cp8rumbeaka2800,4.0,KPMG has provided me great learning opportunities and accelerated my career path in the time that I've been here. They have good benefits and do their best to make sure employees feel welcomed as much as possible.
KPMG,1cot34kncaqhd800,4.0,This is a great company to work for. You will be exposed to many people and different types of work. You have flexibility on what type of projects you'd like to be on and what you want to learn and be able to do for yourself.
KPMG,1corf8b2p52u5800,2.0,"When you're busy, you're verrry busy, and when you're not, your teams don't know how to handle that, so they make you stay late anyways. You'll always be on at least 3 year-end audits every year, sometimes more. If your biggest client isn't super busy, resource management will just move you on to another team that is."
KPMG,1coeo1ua9brdt800,3.0,- Tons of opportunities to learn and grow
KPMG,1coecd1pl5j5q800,5.0,"Excellent place to jumpstart your career. Get experience with the biggest companies. Highly respected. At any one time, had an engagement manager, performance manager, and assigned mentor."
KPMG,1cocndmo0akd7800,3.0,"Company offers a smorgasbord of advisory services to compliment tax and audit, but sees the world through the lens of financial management. Independence is top of mind, all the time--as it should be--and effects everything you do from investment management to opportunity pursuit. Workforce is relatively young and vibrant."
KPMG,1co2cu3gjb81v800,5.0,"KPMG is a remarkable place to work. It is a Big Four Firm that provides the training, experiences, and opportunities that set employees apart from other individuals within the public accounting/consulting realm. KPMG is as good as it gets!"
KPMG,1co271u6s52tr800,4.0,KPMG was my first job out college. I learned about taxation of U.S. branches of foreign banks.  The hours were long and unforgiving but I learned a great deal.
KPMG,1cnvllss352tr800,2.0,I think KPMG seems to have a lot of smart young people and a lot of other people who love their titles and think that they deserve respect based solely on the length of time they've been there and the fact that they leeched onto someone along the way and got promoted above where they deserve. They bill you out for the max possible rate but want to give you the least amount of paid training possible. Other than the compensation there isn't a single thing I could recommend about working here.
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."
KPMG,1cmjong1o5ndcce4,5.0,"The team I am in has gone through lots of changes. Now more than ever, their is more value to the individual than before. The culture is trying to adapt to the fast changing society we live in. The work is very hectic though, there is a lot to do, sometimes the hours are CRAZY, but it's all worth it when you acknowledge the benefits. I am sure there are better companies out there, but KPMG is pretty darn good if you ask me. They are learning more about work-life balance."
KPMG,1cm99tl8352t7ess,5.0,Very long hours with constant motivation from management and co-workers. Working on excel files throughout the day with breaks for lunch and dinner. Provides optimal growth opportunity.

KPMG,1cm5idjvg5j518pt,4.0,A typical day at work would be creating and updating complex spreadsheets and alter formulas for pre-prepping billing data reconciliation spreadsheets.   I enjoy preparing and working with spreadsheets.
KPMG,1cm5hfojs5j519k2,5.0,A typical day would start by planning the day and having a morning brief meeting with the departmental manager to check progress of work. Allocation of assignments and execution of work allocated.
KPMG,1cm5bo2v6aqgicuj,5.0,KPMG is a huge accounting firm in the public accounting sector.  I would prefer to be working for a corporation instead.  Most times I felt like a number just because of the size.
KPMG,1cm37uis45nd3bqv,4.0,"KPMG was a lovely place to work, the culture of the place was, it puts it;s employees first.  They had a wonderful work life balance policy, great diversity, family oriented and a great habit of recognizing and awarding outstanding work."
KPMG,1clusmngkak8sbl0,2.0,"KPMG has competitive benefits, salary rates, and work/life balance. Additionally, I felt like I was treated fairly by managers during the year end review process and always felt as if I was putting out high-quality, sufficiently reviewed work."
KPMG,1clrha6at52t0evl,5.0,Great learning experience which provided a lot of analytical and problem solving skills. Auditing is very procedural and schedule based. Met a lot of people from all walks of like
KPMG,1cllpnc9uak50899,1.0,"If you like like politics this is the place for you. If you aim to get ahead by hard work, you may want to look elsewhere. No clarity, no direction. Save yourself the trouble and apply elsewhere."
KPMG,1cllb2hhjb813cn3,4.0,You need to really love what you're doing and willing to put in 110% or you probably won't last one year.  Must be technically capable with a strong personality or you will get eaten for breakfast!
KPMG,1cll8bm8e1bgc7ho,3.0,Great brand.  Fourth among the Big 4. Great talent base.
KPMG,1clk2vlgj1aht0is,4.0,"KPMG provides an innovative, flexible environment in which employees find a great place to build their careers.  Benefits are comprehensive and quite good."
KPMG,1cliabppr5ncvc75,1.0,"Poor working condition, but very good place to learn and start your career."
KPMG,1cli8km621bad5cd,3.0,The position made for a quick stressful one with no support from management. Picking favorites and throwing coworkers under the bus for promotions is the norm.
KPMG,1clh7cr3q5ncvfb7,4.0,the company itself is a great company. great benefits. You will work hard for them. It is hard to rate the company the way Indeed asks barbecue each business unit/practice is so different
KPMG,1clfnadedb852a47,4.0,"Office culture is very specific towards a certain type of employee making it harder for everyone to feel completely included. However, my overall experience was very good."
KPMG,1clf8v00sbrcvbs7,4.0,The teams in Advisory were amazing to work with. The best part of the job was that the partners and the team included you in everything. I learned that everything happens for a reason.
KPMG,1cl24pg1las0ofat,4.0,"I started at KPMG with at least 25 other new college graduates from my university.  I stayed 4 years, and was the last of those 25 to leave.    The job is very intense and takes a LOT of your personal time - but you know that going in.  I am and always will be extremely grateful for the opportunities KPMG offered me.  I learned more in those 4 years than I can imagine and the fact that I did that hard work has opened many doors for me going forward.  It gave other employers a clear message about my capabilities and a confidence in the training I received."
KPMG,1cksec5l3ak4ndc2,4.0,Great Management team. Allowed flexibility. I particularly was impressed with how management encouraged employee feedback and suggestions. This was my second time at KPMG as a contractor.

KPMG,1ckq5tpo3b84hd7r,4.0,I have always been able to manage a work life balance with a 21 hour per week schedule. I love being a administrative assistant. I enjoy collaborating with the owners of the firm.
KPMG,1ckdmp4pc1bgd785,4.0,"Aside from KPMG being a great place to advance your career, perks such as Jump Start Fridays in the summer, company closing between Christmas and New Years, Company Holiday party and Summer Picnic are a nice bonus."
KPMG,1ckddfuns0mtu1m7,5.0,"Corporate culture so far has been surprisingly good. YMMV from team to team, but I have had great experiences thus far. Tone from the top is great."
KPMG,1ckd6q08l1ags4u7,5.0,"I worked at KPMG during the summer of 2017 as a BPG Intern, along with several other NYC students coming from different boroughs and schools.From the moment I walked into the office, I could tell what a collaborative environment I was in. Everyone is willing to stop and lend a helping hand when needed. You are always kept busy; there is always something to do. The best part of the job is being able to work collaboratively with others, whether an assignment/project or a volunteer opportunity. Through KPMG, I learned a lot about networking as well as the corporate world and the finance industry. It was a great experience and I would definitely go back if I had the chance."
KPMG,1ckakk1nq1bab3ru,4.0,Very busy day great tenants and co-workers. A lot of great eating places. Free laundry and shoe shine. Building is easy to learn and is very quiet at night
KPMG,1ck98j3fi0mtb3v3,5.0,"KPMG, along with all of the Big 4 accounting firms, provide an invaluable start to your career.  The best thing I ever did was go to work for KPMG right out of college.  It establishes your career, and opens up a ton of doors throughout life."
KPMG,1ck8ujkas1ahq541,3.0,I only did an internship in the deskside support department for about 7 weeks. Good experience but it might be hard to get a full time positions there.
KPMG,1ck8kr4ap0mcr6ef,3.0,There are several paths one can take to achieve their goals as long as those goals coincide with those of the firm.
KPMG,1ck6mnr3l1ahk5t3,4.0,"Working at KPMG has opened many doors in my career. The hours are long but the experience in invaluable. Culture and tone depend on the office, overall it was a great experience."
KPMG,1ck0dpc7k0mt775t,3.0,"One of the primary reasons I left, was due to the fact that many positions were being filled by contractors. They did not give a sense of job security."
KPMG,1ck05s4ns1agn52a,3.0,KPMG is a great company but you feel the pressure to work long house to complete work. There are way too many meetings and you have to work late in order to complete your work due to being in meetings all day. In order to move up in the company you need to sacrifice your family time and show your commitment to the company in order to be recognized. Salary can be better. Not enough for someone with a large family.
KPMG,1cju693871ai3307,5.0,Good place to work to gain great fundamental financial background and see how many companies do things.  Great way to learn Best Practices in a short time.
KPMG,1cjr1v2301ah54ao,3.0,"KPMG is an awesome firm to work for! However, the engagement I’m currently assigned to is poorly managed with unorganized project teams.  From my experience on this project, I’ve been treated unfairly by Senior Associates. It’s sad what one would do just to get noticed in hopes for a promotion to the next level.  The actual project manager and Directors are beyond amazing! Super nice and caring!!!(Although they’re not on site as much). A “manager” is actually “running” the project as Deputy Project Mgr and you can really see the lack of experience. Here on this project, I feel like only a number who’s filling a position. There’s also NO WORK LIFE BALANCE. You’re expected to work overtime with NO COMPENSATION or incentives. The traveling gets overwhelming too. The Deputy Project Mgr really does not care about the employees and she leads with her emotions OFTEN. I’m really thinking about transferring to another area of the firm or requesting a different engagement."
KPMG,1cjn6acv9akh383e,3.0,"Like most big 4 jobs, most people are looking for exit opportunities. Good place to start a career and make connections, but its depressing seeing most of your coworkers leave."
KPMG,1cjfkem4d5j54am3,5.0,I was only here for a few months but the office atmosphere was fantastic. Everyone that I had met had been supportive in my success and transition into a large company life style.

Manage debt agreements, minimize interest expenses, and issue quarterly financial statements. Analyze pro forma for 6 major real estate projects. Prepare annual operating budget. Cultivate strong relationships with local and state government officials, as well as vendors and community members to communicate corporate vision."
KPMG,1cj99eqr2ak558er,4.0,"Work/life balance is difficult at the senior level, but is much better at the manager level. The biggest hurdle I've faced has been high turnover of senior associates, and the firm not being able to replace them quickly enough, or with sufficient resources."
KPMG,1cj75dtu7ak55f54,4.0,"I did the typical 2-3 year stint in public accounting, and then transitioned to a job with better work/life balance.  KPMG provided a solid foundation of experience for my career in accounting/finance."
KPMG,1cj6hfv9pak978kq,4.0,"KPMG invests a lot in its employees by providing ongoing training in topics realted to an employee's industry, function, and career development. The company's performance management process is one of the best in the world."
KPMG,1cj3lk958akgufso,3.0,"My typical day would begin during the beginning of the month. Each month the clients would submit their data for sales and use tax. The process begins with the checklist, reports and funding. The work is very stressful because of deadlines and errors that may occur during the process. The most enjoyable part of the job is after the 20th when compliance is over. I enjoyed working with others as well as learning from them about sales and use tax."
KPMG,1diig4ujr24ec000,5.0,"I loved every aspect of my internship at KPMG. From the first day onwards, I was learning new skills and being provided with opportunities to hone in on old ones. My coworkers were all very fun and supportive of me, each other, and the firm as a whole."

In this company I have learned how to prioritize and delegate when responsibilities are not relevant to my work package. Our work culture is business-like, but still down to earth. There is no hard part in my work, I find my profession awesome. What I like most of the job. Is that I manage 3 agendas of 3 partners so, no workday is the same."

KPMG,1chod5242as0mbch,4.0,Started at KPMG right after college in their advisory program.  Our group had a good work life balance compared to others.

KPMG,1chlsb0fk5ncmdrp,4.0,This organization is too large to provide true career development.
KPMG,1chgo2fh4akgga5v,1.0,"Some interns were treated better than FT employees. The corporate culture changed during my time with the firm (17 years) and with management not willing to take the necessary steps to make improvements, the work environment grew more and more toxic. Many employees left the firm leading up to my separation from the firm. There is a high turnover in F&A and Intl Tax."
KPMG,1che3fg4kaqggerr,3.0,"A typical day is structured around meetings, and then after 530pm, you could begin work. Team management is not a supportive of work/life balance as the firm management which is disappointing. The firm culture does a great job at thanking employees for their hard work, but that does nto always trickle down by manager or group."
KPMG,1chcckip41d1f1mj,3.0,"I enjoy auditing. I enjoy KPMG. I think my job is a huge stepping stone for my career and I honestly learn so much. My only real complaint is that more often than not, I feel like I am just a warm body. They preach family/work life balance, but I've worked more 65+ hour weeks than not.

KPMG,1cgu8lg6g1agv4rh,3.0,overall is a good place to work but the management keeps involving people who don't know the daily struggle.  I would say they really need to work on this concerning admin managers and i think they will lose a lot of great admins if they focus too much on piling work rather than quality.
KPMG,1cgu518mf0mtv1cd,3.0,"I started as an intern here, and worked my way up to Senior Associate. My time spent here has not been the best. The work/life balance is non-existent. You have no control over your life/schedule. You follow everyone else to the tee. It is hard to be an individual here. You are required to move as one. I will say, the perks and benefits are great, but if you value your personal life and aspirations, working for this Big 4 firm, may not be the best option. I am currently transitioning out of the firm. I can no longer spend 14+ hours a day, behind a computer, with no life."

KPMG,1c4tik6oeaka0aqg,1.0,"KPMG itself appears great, though I haven't had much of a chance to interact with the colleagues from the greater firm. But the J&S practice is literally tied for the worst job I've ever had! The Senior Associates doing all the work are, for the most part, great, and the work is important... but the team culture, as actively dictated by management, is incredibly toxic. Hence, everyone is forced to act the worst version of themselves, just to keep their jobs. People are deliberately pushed to compete against each other, creating a never-ending cycle of ""but X does more than Y, so X is better,"" regardless of actual value delivered. It's all personality-driven, based on egos and luck. There is no concept of work-life balance; in fact, even mentioning it will earn you an eternal mark on your reputation. The amount of lies that are being spread around by both recruiter and management is impressive, if not staggering. Run, do not walk, away from this practice."

I sat behind this grandiose front desk at KPMG in Atlanta on the 19th floor with the back drop of Stone Mountain and Kennesaw Mountain. It was a broad view with plenty of sunshine. The people were as special as the view. I learned their telephone system and connected to satellite offices and even to Germany. I could connect people to other offices in various countries. I learned the sound of their voices so I know who I was talking without them saying their names. I felt it was important to remember the ""regulars"".

KPMG,1b9gg1cr452uobc1,4.0,"The hours are terrible, but the opportunity is enormous.  Just like every other Big 4 firm, you'll make way more than you're worth in your first couple of years, you'll soak up a ton of experience during all of your late nights and dinners at your desk, and then you'll be worth way more than you make for a few years.  Anyone who jumps ship at the Senior or Manager level can expect to see a great increase in pay outside of public accounting.  Anyone that sticks around to make partner can expect to wait about 15 years (give or take 3 years depending on the market), but then partner compensation is pretty fantastic."

That expectation has been met and exceeded. As a manager in KPMG, A typical work day starts with a conference call with clients and getting to know their problems. Then I hold status quo meetings with my teams. Everyone openly offer their perspectives. I work with other directors to make decisions on allocation, budget and client meetings.  In the past 5 years, I have been able to take on large amounts of responsibilities very early in my career. I manage my team workload, find ways to motivate the team morale and report to boss the progress, multi-task on various projects. I worked with very smart people. Some of them are promoted to partner in their early 30s. Some left and became controller in fortune 500 companies. Some went back top MBA schools.

KPMG,1b4jvm54m0mtp0ji,3.0,The company has a brand name and is a good place to work for. However one has to be willing to adapt to sudden changes between clients and manager expectations. I would still say that working for this company has helped me learn a lot and understand the work culture.

KPMG,1b3uscugn52tqf2u,3.0,"Extremely long work hours during tax season. Late or overnight work was pretty normal. Some employees didn't sleep a few days and seniors admired them. Adversely, off season was very slow and hard to fill up chargeability hours."
KPMG,1b3q7l5rg5nag8cd,2.0,"Love the job and a great experience, but no time for myself outside of work.  I just got married and want to be able to have a family in a few years.  Staying at work every day for 13 hours or more is not going to warrant that."

KPMG,1b383d8uc1d0i63r,4.0,"I found KPMG to be a fantastic place to work in general.  Everyone is very smart but that does not mean you will get along with them.  They do work hard to advance people but tend to end up very top heavy which can make it hard to complete with other firms on price.  I also find that they are a bit slow to take up new technologies that are needed in the industry.  My co workers were great and they work hard to teach me new skills but I find that learning new skills is talked about but not necessarily acted upon by senior management so there was little formal training.    The hardest part of the job was the constant travel which made it hard for me to have a personal life.  Then, when budgets got tight, they cut off travel which made it very difficult to connect with clients.  It is a very entrepreneurial  culture  so you have to make it on your own.  Nobody is going to hold your hand along the way, which can be good or bad.  It is good that it weeds out those that don't make the cut quickly, but it can be bad that everyone is fighting for the same piece of pie."
KPMG,1b3530k241fvi2m6,5.0,"Yo worked hard.  Were appreciated.  Room to grow which I did.  Friendly, professional environment.  Loved to go to work everyday.  Very sad when I found out that my partner was retiring."

I also started with a large group of college graduates which made for fun office events and parties.  The environment was a little too cut-throat for me and I did not see myself working there long-term."
KPMG,1b23kqfk21agi4o3,5.0,"I would recommend anyone I know to work for KPMG. It's a wonderful work environment, especially for people just out of college.While there are plenty of opportunities to advance within the company, it should be noted that it can be difficult to actually advance due to the size of the company.

KPMG,1av0s373bak548p5,5.0,"KPMG Nigeria was an amazing company to intern with over the summer, the organizational culture of the company is well structured and makes one feel at home right away. I interned for three months, and I wish I could have interned for a longer amount of time, but I had to get back to school. My co-workers were very friendly and treated me with the same respect that they would treat full-time employees. The way the offices were structured allowed for the smooth interaction between supervisors and subordinates. They had an open door policy which allowed easy accessibility to all individuals throughout the company. They also advocated to avoid saying ""sir/madam"" and just refer to people by their first name. This was a huge problem for me, cause everyone was older. But I eventually got used to it. KPMG Nigeria is a very flexible, yet time filing, occupying company. I'm glad I had the privilege to  intern with them."

KPMG,1au150h675nd380k,2.0,"As with most public firms, KPMG has generous benefits and advancement opportunities but you work your butt off to get them.

A typical day at work consisted of being around people just like myself who like to have fun, learn and engage in challenging projects on a daily basis. It is the planet fitness of the professional realm in the sense that it is a judgment-free zone. Despite the fact that the busy season is a strenuous cycle, you mature and develop in a regimented fashion that all your peers facilitate and understand. The most difficult part of the job is learning on the fly but this is what sets those who excel apart from those that coast. Leveraging resources when needed and client relationships are taught at an early stage in life and individuals are exposed to situations that are incomparable elsewhere straight out of college."

The work (audit engagements) is tiring and sucks the life out of you."
KPMG,1a86heert5nba821,4.0,"I worked for a small company that was acquired by KPMG. The company I worked for sprung the acquisition on us, so we didn't have a ton of time to accept the change and take it all in. But I've worked for KPMG for two years now, and overall it's been good. The benefits are fantastic. Maternity leave is wonderful. The people are mostly good and mean well. There are some people in management positions that are clueless and don't need to be here.

KPMG,1a5567pjpas17dt0,1.0,"Work life balance is a total lie at this company. They rarely treat their people with humanity, you will have to travel extensively on top of 50-60 hour work weeks.

I would not wish it on my worst enemy. They work you like a dog, the pay isn't great but they do have nice benefits. I was an experienced hire so It was a bit different for me than some one coming straight out of college.

KPMG,19dbap1sbas0gaq2,1.0,"You can forget having any kind of social life if you work in the KPMG Dallas office and you do any type of tax compliance work.

You can expect to work 18 to 20 hour days during busy season and maybe get some sleep on the weekends if you're lucky.  Some members of management work the same hours so raising the issue is preaching to the choir.  The firm has programs in place for developing their people similar to other big 4 firms, however, I did not  experience any type of coaching.  It was sink or swim for me.  The only upside to working at KPMG was the bonus and pay which isn't bad if you're willing to sacrifice having a life for money."

They treated people with utter disrespect and openly discriminate and retaliate against those that dare to call them on the carpet for breaking the law.  They openly create a hostile terrorized work environment.  Employees are always afraid to say anything because they are in fear 100% of the time that if they say anything they can forget all plans for future advancement and can count on being retaliated against by the company and fired.  They conduct themselves openly declaring themselves as above the law and omnipotent.  If you like living in a terrified situation and being treated like an slave oarsman on an old barge then this place is for you..

However, I was immediately ""knocked down a peg"" by one of the people doing the orientation. I explained that I ""went permanent"" on X date, and she immediately responded that ""nobody is ever permanent"" ""we just let you use this job"". I thought that to be a very rude and counterproductive attitude. However, once I began work, I enjoyed working in an upscale environment. I was issued a laptop as though it were no more than a clipboard. The down side of that was that I had to carry it home daily and be responsible for it. The worst part of the job was that I was supposed to be in training, yet the girl assigned to my training wasn't training me. I had no idea what was expected of me. When I would ask questions of our supervisor, I would only get vague answers that never helped. The trainer was eventually fired, and still, no one properly trained me, and later on, I myself was let go without warning or explanation."

I thought that to be a very rude and counterproductive attitude. However, beyond that, I thought the perks of working in an upscale office were good. At the time, laptops were assigned as though they were clipboards. The down side of that was that you had to carry it home daily and be responsible for it. Our department moved from the prestigious Peachtree St. office to a regular office off of West Paces Ferry shortly after I began. The strange part was, I was NEVER officially trained in the job I was hired for, and had no idea what was expected of me. Then the girl who was supposed to be training me was fired, and shortly thereafter, so was I. I was never given a reason."

Each engagement is unique and provides a different working environment in relation to the size of teams and the frequency of manager presence. Associates are typically responsible for more routine accounting areas such cash, prepaids, accounts payable, fixed assets and investments. Testwork includes tests of operating effectiveness over the control environment as well as substantively testing year-end balances through trend analysis and/or selections of individual transactions. Challenges include completing all audit testwork within a short-period of time while staying in the parameters of the established budget. However, the job allows associates to communicate with staff accountants, controllers, and at times, CFO’s which quickly builds on networking and communication skills."

Unlike other places I have worked, I don't sense the level of cohesion within the Milwaukee tax group that I have previously experienced in public accounting and that I believe to be essential for maximum efficiency and productivity. The group seems disjointed and I believe the ""we"" and ""team"" mentality is absent. Furthermore, the Milwaukee tax group lacks the partner level of leadership that I very much need (and have previously had) at the level I am at in my career. As far as the audit and advisory partners/leaders in Milwaukee, I have had positive experiences similar to the very positive feeling from my exposure to tax partners and leaders in Chicago."

PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1f7u5bvklu1m4800,4.0,"Fun workplace with passionate co-workers. If you love pets and helping pet owners, this is the place for you. However, you must have passion for it because the pay is not there."
PetSmart,1f7r1er0qhihn800,3.0,Work hard paid not so hard. Not easy to advance and if you do you are over worked. Trading commission is okay but only if you can sell tons. A lot income store doesn't do that
PetSmart,1f7pqfrvct53t800,3.0,"My time here was super slow paced and everyone just seemed like they just wanted to go home, which is valid. Employees were occasionally nice but overall it was depressing."
PetSmart,1f7p8t1r5u23e800,4.0,"The Culture Petsmart has created is great. I felt welcomed and had an overall good time in the DC. Pay is good, they were very flexible with me going to school. I had no real complaints."
PetSmart,1f7p050g3o25r800,2.0,"The coworkers and managers will talk behind your back. Tips are okay, most of the coworkers would belittle you or make you feel incompetent. They would schedule you without telling you and get mad you didn't show up. Its okay but be prepared to do more work and yelled at for not being ""fast enough""  don't be ontime but 5 minutes early"
PetSmart,1f7ouc713u23e800,3.0,"Overworked and underpaid sums it up. I enjoy working with the dogs. I just started out about a month ago as a bather and will be attending the grooming academy, hopefully. I wasn't aware that I would have to give up every weekend to work and plus closing at all times."
PetSmart,1f7n33kg0sa3c800,3.0,This was a nice start to my career working with animals. The basic training provided for animal care was sufficient and helped guide me to more focused animal welfare efforts.
PetSmart,1f7l33q2lo14k800,3.0,I did not like working there because of the way they treated the small animals. Staff was cool. But the birds and fish were not treated the best. It was om for a starting job
PetSmart,1f7ko1uujhirt800,3.0,"The job itself isn't too bad, but the only thing leadership cares about is making money and keeping customers. Not all managers care about their associates and the ones that do are few and far between. No matter what a customer does, if they complain to the manager or corporate they get what they want"
PetSmart,1f7hb5uhu3kis000,3.0,"I feel that corporate doesn't understand the needs of the store with the hours given to us. we usually close the store with 3 people and this is ok sometimes. However over the past year it has not. During the evening shifts we often on busy days only have 3 people on in the store with one cashier, one leader and one pet care associate. I order to provide the best customer service the leader is forced to chose whether to become back up cashier, help customers or help in pet care when they are backed up. Our customers reflect their experience with this in customer surveys."
PetSmart,1f7h59v4pt3q7800,2.0,"PetSmart wants to pay you the minimum and then give you every task known to man. Someone called out? Too bad. Figure it out without them. Didn’t get everything completed due to lack of staff? Too bad, here’s your write up. Need to call out because your legitimately sick? Get over it and get to work. You tested positive for covid? Well why’d you come to work sick? Because you made me!! I seriously cannot stress to you enough... there are not enough words in the English dictionary for me to explain to you and caution you on how awful company is and how it drains you of every spark of energy that you think you have! And then they wanna play the whole “make associates feel like they belong” .. “we care about you and your health” .... Total front. Not to mention the lack of support. You’ve got one person over here with their head so far up the SL’s cheeks that you’re unsure of which one is actually the SL. Another one over here busting it, while that person over their is getting all the credit. Just don’t. Don’t apply. I’m gonna stop now. But I could go on for days."
PetSmart,1f7fkt30tu2ud800,2.0,"It's fun to play with dogs at PetsHotel but unfortunately Petsmart is very bureaucratic with too many policies that get in the way of common sense, leading to high turnover."
PetSmart,1f7fbkncft3q7800,2.0,"When I began at Petsmart 10 years ago, it was a great place to work. But this gradually changed to what it is now: a place where the store and services employees are treated like chattel, while upper management at the home office in Arizona issue decrees from on high that aren't in line with in reality. Store and services workers are expected to perform an ever increasing amount of work with less -- less pay, less labor hours allocated, and less support."
PetSmart,1f7cr9uj2o1nd800,1.0,"The supervisors and team leads are clicky and don't let anyone they don't like succeed. They change their opinion about agents within a day and will randomly pick people to abuse their power. You might be sitting with a team of 18 people and then the next day 9. Quality Assurance and other parts are bogus for the most part and can't actually help the agents grow. They let people work from home in waves when the pandemic first hit because they didn't fund enough equipment in preparation. and they made some of us stay for like 3 months into it all, also the people chosen to work from home were not picked based on performance or tenor, but rather favouritism (THE WORST PART) and barely any compliance with social distancing. I had other people around me who literally just got done traveling across state within 14 days and I got covid from them. When I told them about my concerns they brushed it off every time with a ""yeah... unfortunately that's just how it is [*Smiley Face* :)  if it was an IM just to be even more petty.] And also because its like company protocol to have no expression of worry and a ""CAN DO"" attitude the whole time even when just casually speaking to peers on break. Not really a ton of room to move up and if you mess up once on like your first day, you have to wait like 6 months to have that problem removed from your account."
PetSmart,1f7cpbqgqt3q7800,4.0,The store is great my dogs loves to go there and the people are nice and you guys have lots of food brands and toys that I love and they love to I like cats to and …
PetSmart,1f7cjvgfit3q7800,3.0,I worked here in college and it was okay. My manager was okay but the pay was minimal and my raise was 25 cents...which is ridiculous. Customers were nice. There didnt seem to be much culture at my store.
PetSmart,1f7c7tm6st3q7800,5.0,I absolutely love working here. I worked at another big retail store before transferring to the life of pets and I cannot express enough how much happier I am now!
PetSmart,1f7atrssfo1nd800,3.0,"the job is relatively easy; being a cashier, stocking shelves, and a heavy focus on customer service. customer service/getting sales is their biggest priority. don’t get sick and call out, or they’ll get upset."
PetSmart,1f79m0gs7t3q7800,4.0,"I worked in the PetsHotel area of PetSmart and I can say it was quite fun. You get to work with dogs and sometimes cats but it kind of sucks cause you have to clean all the gross stuff but after awhile you get used to it. The managers made sure you had your break and there is room to grow! I was almost promoted (at the time I only worked for a few months) but then covid came so that blew right out the window. One big con is that the managers and team leaders had no back bone. If there was a serious issue with an employee they would barely do anything. Or if someone wasn’t doing their job right, they would say something one time but that was it and then get mad when the employee would do it again but still they wouldn’t do anything about it. But other than that still a decent job."
PetSmart,1f77id3gphijp800,3.0,"At first working here was ok, however I quickly learned that every one else was making more than I was and getting a raise is close to impossible. Made me bitter about going the extra mile and not getting any recognition for it. I was a petcare specialist, however they often would put me to work on the register which no one wanted to do. Also management would often make “jokes” or degrade petcare staff making it seem like their job was easier than it was. The only good thing about this job that I can think of it was that it was easy to call out of/get days off or people to cover for you."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1f76okgnh3obs000,2.0,"Being told from day one about going to grooming school is the only thing that has kept me going, the pay is absolutely absurd barely covers my phone bill & food, i do like getting paid weekly but that is probably the only plus side to this job. Expected to not only do about 4-6 dogs in 5 hours but also expected to answer every phone call (managers only care about the customers) & help the groomers with whatever they need done because THEYRE running behind. I feel that I am treated like i’m a peasant lol. On top of all of that we are extremely limited on hours as bathers which barely gets me $200 a week talk about SAD. I do not recommend this job if youre starting out because you WILL be promised so much more than you will be given. Do not expect a lot out of this job as the company only cares about making their money & not helping their employees or making the daily workplace any easier."
PetSmart,1f76agp84s9vq800,3.0,"Mostly my shift started at 4am to work the truck, but sometimes I would work the register. It’s an okay job but it comes with big box store issues, like chronically being short handed. It’s like they hired and kept employees who didn’t care about their jobs."
PetSmart,1f75s7td3hijp800,5.0,Great job to work as a part time college student. Managers in north 10th put customers first and bend over backwards to answer any questions. Pay is great hours are very flexible and managment is near perfect.
PetSmart,1f7515leuhijp800,5.0,Management is awesome
PetSmart,1f74j0dilhijp800,5.0,I love working petcare. Everyone is friendly and the manager is flexible with my schedule. Animals are number one priority with each employee! Definitely recommend
PetSmart,1f728rpn831ha000,4.0,"The management is helpful and understanding. The culture within my store is very accommodating and friendly. People accept you for who you are and love to point out the good things you do. There are opportunities to move up, especially if you're willing to relocate."
PetSmart,1f71r783ghijp800,3.0,"Too many dogs, not enough associates to care for them. Pay was abysmal for all that we had to put up with. I got plenty of hours because of the high turn over, but I was always stressed with all the dogs I had to care for myself since we were pretty understaffed. Also management was cutting corners in terms of ""walking"" the dogs."
PetSmart,1f7125l2n31ha000,5.0,This is by far my favorite job so far! The managers are awesome and everyone I worked with was so nice. Being around animals every day was such an amazing experience and always brightened my day up. I formed an attachment to all my regulars at doggie day care.
PetSmart,1f701tfk03obs000,2.0,"Usual understaffed even pre-covid creates a fairly stressful environment. Even when staffed the company does little to create an inclusive environment. Employees often create a hostile workplace for each other and solutions are not team building. They do not practice any kind of team building so it's to be expected that information between employees isn't fluid. Communications are often minimal which can be confusing. Animal care knowledge is minimal as well and it's often beneficial for employees to spend personal time educating themselves. This can often lead to frustrations as the focus is in sales of products. However, scheduling tends to be on-demand as low staffing creates openings for either extra hours or specific hours. Pay isn't competitive and level caps without a ladder system for advancement means raises are low."
PetSmart,1f6tgpnems7es800,3.0,"Definitely a company that sees you as disposable. Managers and corporate make it very clear that they do not care about you unless you’re boosting their numbers. Worked at more than one location and always saw managers that were under qualified for their jobs or just overwhelmed by the workload. Salon teams are usually constantly overwhelmed, expected to each groom up to 6 dogs a shift while also being expected to answer the phone that rings off the hook all day. You start out as a bather and then end up going to academy to be a groomer (if your manager even wants you to). Pay for the bather position is trash and 100% not worth the manual labor that you do. I lost 30lbs as a bather and wasn’t out of shape to begin with. Policy says you’re not supposed to lift over a certain weight but the groomers never have time to help you lift dogs so you’re on your own."
PetSmart,1f6q78rb6s7es800,3.0,"Management sucks and tends to pick favorites,very repetitive, pay isn't worth what they put you through, expect you to do everyone else's job including theirs without giving extra pay. But working with the animals is alot of fun.."
PetSmart,1f6q1dojf31ha000,4.0,The Petsmart I have worked at is very small but has some of the nicest customers that come in. Often people ask questions for petcare and how to properly setup animal husbandry. Of course there is always a odd person here and there who are a bit spiteful. But overall great place to work.
PetSmart,1f6opue6ps7es800,5.0,"Great to work with animals and be able to talk to others about animals, but pay is limited and the only advancement requires early morning stocking shifts."
PetSmart,1f6oo9jrgs9vq800,2.0,Hard place to work when you have children.  My pay was not great for the amount of work required.  It is taxing to deal with angry customers so much.  I enjoy working with animals
PetSmart,1f6nlko85hijp800,4.0,"You get to do a ton of stuff when you work at petsmart and it is especially fun for animal lovers, But just like any retail job it has its cons, which if you're used to it won't be a bother."
PetSmart,1f6n5sqq5n5f6800,2.0,The pay is too low compared to the work put in. Some days I’d have to clock out for my lunch and immediately go back to work just so I can finish the dogs on my schedule.
PetSmart,1f6n5idopu3l3800,1.0,I've had a couple good store managers here but for the most part management is a joke. I worked in grooming. Their training is ridiculously bad (I was trained elsewhere). They say they want quality over quantity but that's a lie. All corporate looks at are numbers and couldn't care less about you as a person. Grooming management is either power tripping or looking to move on or both. If you know what your doing you can make more money being a groomer. They write their policy and procedures for inexperience and stupidity.
PetSmart,1f6n5bv81s7m8800,5.0,Been with them for three years always willing to teach and promote from within.  Most stores setup very similar so easy to move within the system for promotions.
PetSmart,1f6jfembbu1ap800,4.0,"Coworkers are generally good, I enjoyed them quite a bit but the management is always on your back and ready to reprimand you for your work no matter the situation without opportunity to explain yourself."
PetSmart,1f6jf8qhau1ap800,4.0,"Pet Smart can and has been in the past, a great place to work. They pay me well. The down side is advancement. I am teaching my boss his job and he just can't catch on after 9 months. He makes the big money while I am hourly."

PetSmart,1f6ispcmbo2as800,5.0,This was the best job I've ever had. I worked in the PetsHotel and PetSmart takes care of their employees. We got free speakers to use in the DayKamp center and it was great! Highly Recommend.
PetSmart,1f6ioobtgu1pa800,4.0,"The best part of this job is seeing the animals. The hours are long and repetitive. Working the trucks can get repetitive, especially if it's the same stuff over and over."
PetSmart,1f6igbe3is7jd800,4.0,"fun place to work with room for growth, management helps you when they can. have responsibilities to care for the animals, which is a good thing. Nice customers too"
PetSmart,1f6ieqqiku1pa800,2.0,Corporate is always looking at the numbers and micro manages. Focus on your negatives more than your positives. Yet to hear them compliment me or a coworker.
PetSmart,1f6hsbochu1ap800,2.0,Felt under appreciated as an employee! At the end of the day it was only about the numbers! They often punish employees who have appointments or go home sick by cutting their hours down. When you put in your notice they list you as no rehire!
PetSmart,1f6gujmmbsa2f800,3.0,My team is by far the best part of my job. I’ve worked at PetSmart for 3 almost 4 years. I worked my way up a regular associate to management.  At first it was great but with covid hours were cut regardless of how busy all the stores have been with “quarantine pets.”Corporate keeps taking away required tasks or telling us to do them less often to justify the lack of hours but doing things like animal counts less often make numbers much less accurate and it takes me more to to do them once a month than it did once a week. We still have the same amount of tasks to complete and not enough hours. It has made the job very stressful and I feel as though there is never enough time in the day.
PetSmart,1f6gq407c3ocs000,4.0,"I love my coworkers and working with animals. However, PetSmart is very much a large corporation that values quantity over quality in almost all areas. Compensation definitely needs to be higher, especially for those working directly with animals. Again, I love working with animals, but I come home sore and covered in bruises and scratches every single day. I feel as though they should be paying us more for the physical labor and risk of injury."
PetSmart,1f6gfjhubu3a7800,4.0,"Work sometimes gets busy during weekend afternoons. Management seems to care for employees, and form connections. Employees seem to trust one another and gets along well. Petcare associates know their stuff and try to give customers good advice, but oftentimes customers ignore us. You will sometimes deal with angry customers but management will always intervene to help you out. Overall a good place of belonging. Most workers are in college though."
PetSmart,1f6g7p5eqt4nb800,3.0,"Working in the salon is fun and the dogs make it almost worth it. However it is an underpaid position for the amount of work and customer service aspect. Work-life balance is abysmal. They’ll say they evenly try to schedule weekends and holidays, but you will be there for weekends and holiday. Once heard a manager discouraging employees to grow their families."
PetSmart,1f6dbe1viu3a7800,2.0,"The best part of working for Petsmart is getting to see all the regular customers and their pets as long as they are responsible pet parents.. Besides for that....petsmart used to be a pretty good company.  Of course like all big companies they are always trying to be more profitable so they keep cutting labor. They've cut so many hours, positions in the store that it's impossible to get your work done.  I've worked with an amazing team that stuck with it all through covid but it's finally becoming too much.  We're starting to lose some amazing staff members because their done with corporate piling on more and more, all the while paying low wages and pretending they care.  No. Petsmart does not care about any of their associates or they would give back some hours so our petcare team isn't overworked. Cashiers are always stressed out because now it's only 1 vs having overlapping coverage. They are tired of being the only cashier and hearing customers complain constantly because merchandise isn't on the shelves.... that's because we get very few hours for stocking, long lines....because there's only 1 cashier."
PetSmart,1f6amre8at4nb800,2.0,They give very little training and then if you make an error they rate you up immediately. They also will cut your hours in half without telling you till you see it and they do not accommodate for appointments
PetSmart,1f69mo1t93ocs000,2.0,"PetSmart was a great company to work for when I started 15 years ago. Over the years the company cut hours until the stores were constantly understaffed. It became less important to offer excellent customer service than to save as much money as possible on overhead and as a result you can expect to make less money for more work and deal with more justifiably irrate customers who will cause you more stress than you need. I stuck with it as long as I did because I was and still am passionate about teaching people about their pets, but now that I have the opportunity, I prefer to either find an organization that takes pride in the actual work of dog training, or starting one of my own."
PetSmart,1f68olke9t4eg800,2.0,"While the job has a lot of upside, the downside certainly outweighs it. Regardless of your position there is much to be done and no time to do it. Management is poor as far as communication and although they preach we work as a team, everybody is only does tasks that benefit themselves. Most everybody is quick to point fingers when something is done wrong or a mistake has been made, and just as quick to take praise for the good that has been done. To anyone seeking employment at petsmart, be prepared to lose your soul."
PetSmart,1f68i99jau3a7800,3.0,The job isn’t too bad. The dogs were the best part of the job. It was nice once you got a good clientele in place. Being trapped in that glass room was sometimes annoying.
PetSmart,1f663ds6tu3a7800,3.0,"I was hired in 2015, right after they were bought by their current owners but before the current p&p was established, so I have an unfortunately unique view of seeing the decline of the company. I really, really loved my job from 2015-2017, and then due to frequent manager changes and policy changes, it became a much more stressful and hostile work environment. It was more difficult to get animals to the vet, care commitments were changed for the worse, etc."
PetSmart,1f65qo5slo21m800,5.0,"Fast paced at times but over all pretty relaxed. The petcare position was fun, and all of my co workers were easy to get a long with. This position is for people who are truly passionate about working with animals and puts a lot of care into taking care of them. Cashier position also isn’t too bad, rarely were there rude customers."
PetSmart,1f65qlvjio21m800,1.0,I love the job itself even though it can be stressful in the petcare department. But the managers make it unbearable sometimes. Never agreeing on what they want so they are constantly telling you different things and chewing you out for it. Plus the hours are horrible.
PetSmart,1f65i0ruut4uk800,3.0,I liked working for petsmart because you can always advance. Biggest downfall is its a corporation. Im just personally not a corporation type of person
PetSmart,1f658ptv0o21m800,3.0,"It was good for a college job, but the customers tear you down. You're told you can deny sales but then your DM tells you you're not allowed, as it will lead to bad customer reviews."
PetSmart,1f644c4ofsa2m800,2.0,"I worked for petsmart as a Groomer for 10 years. The turn over is so high. Groomers are pushed to groom more and more to make the store more money all the while they are expected to still answer phones, book appointments, check in clients, and spend at least 10 minutes with each for check in and check out. People who have never groomed sit around and come up with ideas of how to make a salon better but have no idea what they are talking about."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1f62lpk9gs7bk800,4.0,"Hard physical work, but can pay off if you're a groomer. Bathers get paid hourly while groomers start at 40% and after completing academy go to 50%"
PetSmart,1f60fv0eho1kn800,3.0,"Overall, It serves a purpose, you get paid weekly. Schedule comes out 2 weeks in advance so you can plan a life outside of work. I like being able to move around and try new departments."
PetSmart,1f60altg5308d000,3.0,Not bad but not great either. Worked directly with dogs so I didn't have to deal with customers which is a plus for me. Worst part is when no one wants to dump the waste buckets the shift before leaving with a mess
PetSmart,1f607du71saai800,1.0,Never enough staff to give good customer service yet we were told it was up to us to make sure every customer was taken care of. Poor management. Company constantly told grooming salon workers that safety came first but did not provide them with the tools and staffing needed to always put safety first. Always feeling pressure from company to up-sell and groom more dogs than possible.
PetSmart,1f5u7dbv8u3af800,3.0,Good. Liked the people. Different for each person and store. get to see animals and meet a lot of nice people. i had a lot of fun working and 10/10!!!
PetSmart,1f5tptqrfu4lu800,5.0,The things that stand out to me working here are the passion from the other employees about the animals they care for and send out to good homes. I've learned a lot from them in my short time here.
PetSmart,1f5tp5orou3af800,1.0,They are money driven don’t have a care about the animals health or the groomers if a groomer doesn’t feel comfortable they push the groomer anyways or force the pet onto someone else. Short breaks if you got them the people there are very rude and not team players managers only care about how much money you could make they have favorites. They work the ones who will work to death to the point they hate their jobs and the ones that call out constantly or show up late all the time are fine never get in trouble.
PetSmart,1f5pdodq0u3af800,4.0,"This was a good place to work, however I was not given the position I applied for. I got hired for pet care, but instead of working for pet care I only worked the register."
PetSmart,1f5na6m5au3af800,2.0,"These things really depend on the region and individual stores. That being said, pay is seldom adequate and not evenly distributed. If you accept a lower wage thinking it will go up, it may take years. People with no experience will make more money just starting out, but employees that have been there over 5 years will have only received a yearly 10 cent raise if their performance was ranked well. Job can be enjoyable if you need something temporary or have other income to rely on. You can learn a lot about differerent animal and fish species if you take the time to read on your own time."
PetSmart,1f5m8oq07u4lu800,4.0,"Great job!! usually on weekdays in the morning there would be nothing much to due, but you still got paid hourly so you could see yourself sitting around for about 1-2 hours doing nothing (this depends on which store you're applying for), aside from the occasional walk-in. They sometimes hold special adoption days, where you can meet with future customers and dogs. the job usually includes making appointments, cleaning (sweeping, cleaning the bathing area, etc...), grooming and bathing the pets that come in, and answering customer questions, which they go over in their training period (which you get paid for). You get paid a decent amount of money and you also get tips. Overall great place to work at!!"
PetSmart,1f5llf41l308d000,4.0,"Getting to see happy and loving animals everyday is a huge plus, but it’s a retail job very focused on sales. Typically its very easy to request time off and see family, but being a part time associate does not yield any benefits outside of a paycheck. While the staff I work with are awesome, the grind of a corporate job focused on sales and reviews will weigh you down and all you can do is try and provide the best information/advice for a pet parent, but more often than not, they will not take your advice and either return an animal they did not research and blame you or the animal suffers. It is a very hard cycle to be part of as an animal lover. You will learn all sorts of tips and tricks here for taking care of animals though, even from my role as cashier! Be prepared to only receive a lunch during an 8 hour shift though, it is near impossible to receive a break. There is rarely enough help either."
PetSmart,1f5li2uulu3af800,1.0,"It sucks. Pay Is awful, pet parents are entitled and management sucks extremely. I don’t recommend working here unless you want to have the life sucked out of you."
PetSmart,1f5k8a8dvu2n1800,4.0,"Worked there for a little bit as a pet care associate, management was great. Fun if you like animals, if you don't, why are you applying, part time pay not the best, but alright"
PetSmart,1f5ie7nk2u2n1800,1.0,pretty good job i had good co workers i never thought the benefits would be this great free lunches YUM i eat on the job and i use the bathroom to vape
PetSmart,1f5gu65fjsaai800,3.0,"I worked there for about two years and I ended up getting trained in all areas except for training, management, and a groomer but I was a dog Bather trying to become a groomer. I was told by one of the lower managers that if I got trained in most of the jobs at the store I would be able to become full-time. Which I manage to learn almost all of the positions But unfortunately they worked me almost full-time hours for a couple weeks and then I would get one really low week so that way they could keep me  as part time. And when I became a dog bather trying to become a full-time groomer they kept pulling me out of my training to help them back out on the floor. Then when it came time for grooming Academy I ended up not having enough training hours to become a groomer and there wasn’t going to be another one For seven more months. I was a very dedicated and hard-working employee but that did not matter they did not want me to be full-time because then they would have to give me benefits"
PetSmart,1f5gna5nasa39800,4.0,The store management overall are great but Corporate does not listen to their employees. I was not happy about how Corporate treated their cashiers. They forget we can make or beak a store. Cashiering is so key to the store. I will say my store leader was fair and wonderful to work for
PetSmart,1f5gg9s83u3af800,3.0,I enjoyed working here because I love animals but if you get bad management it will make the time here miserable.
PetSmart,1f5gfu2s3u2n1800,1.0,"It's PetSmart. The one I worked at didn't care about their employees, the managers would constantly make fun of other managers, employees and customers when no one else was around. They maybe flexible with your schedule but they'll complain about it. And one of the managers over the early morning stocking would call you at 8 pm that night to make you come in at 1 or 2 in the morning when your scheduled to come in at 4 or 5 without warning."
PetSmart,1f5euoq2au2n1800,4.0,Since it is cooperate your constantly waiting on a higher up and it feels like your not important or ‘annoying’ your mangers. But overall it’s a good support system in the store I worked at.
PetSmart,1f5dh4dt7u3af800,5.0,The staff got along really well. Training was good. The business was very organized and professional. I enjoyed working there. Unfortunately I had to leave because of unexpected health issues.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1f5chi98hsa39800,4.0,The job was okay. We were always short staffed and many people would quit. Some of the managers showed favoritism and other would work harder than others.
PetSmart,1f5boql9gu3af800,4.0,Very good place to work. Good management. Great customer service. Fun environment.  Flexible work schedule.  Overall a great place to work especially if you love animals
PetSmart,1f5bjbgaou2n1800,1.0,If you work here use it to you’re advantage management is hit and miss; be there for the education not the job or the money. Be ready to get out when your contract is up.
PetSmart,1f5bgna9gu3af800,4.0,The job is very fast paced and there’s a lot that needs to be done during your shift. If you’re fully staffed it’s a pretty smooth process but if you’re ever short staffed it really makes the day difficult to get through. Working with the dogs is rewarding and overall the job is cool but just be prepared for unexpected stress.
PetSmart,1f5bcfv91u3af800,4.0,Worked there a long time and enjoyed it when we were a smaller company. As we grew the family feeling went away. Managers get moved around a lot so you never settle in with one group of people before they move out and new people move in.
PetSmart,1f59v7vqesaai800,2.0,"The pethotel was gross, staff and management were extremely lazy and judgemental. There was no outside area for the dogs to go to the bathroom they just potty in their rooms or in the playroom. The playroom only got cleaned twice a day and the rooms rarely got scrubbed. Nasty."
PetSmart,1f58nqlmao1kn800,3.0,"At a store level, it is an interesting and fun place to work. Home office decisions are confusing and sometimes unwarranted, sometimes even detrimental to the success of the store. Even though they offer advancement opportunities and training, seems as if though in order to move up, it'd be better if you were an outside higher. Clear evidence of advancement, but after a decade or more of being within a store."
PetSmart,1f57anjitu2n1800,2.0,"This job is not worth the money spare yourself. PetSmart policies try to protect their animals legally, but their emphasis is on blind sales. Most of the employees have no idea about care for animals or the products they need to sell with animals. Most employees did not care about the animals at all let alone have any knowledge about them to help a customer. Daily I would have to step in and explain to a customer how to care for their pet and what their pet needed because there was only a handful of people in the store that knew anything about the pet. Breaks are short. Store was not cleaned properly. Terrible management, no teamwork or communication."
PetSmart,1f57a545p308d000,3.0,You'll often times find yourself doing work that you didn't sign up for unbeknownst to you. The managers are pretty lazy and will drain the life out of you if you let them.
PetSmart,1f56e9dvnsaai800,3.0,"There is some toxicity within the grooming salons based upon expectations and locations in the area. You are expected to make a large profit for the company, so cycling through dogs is more important than the finished product. Some management doesn't uphold the policies  as strictly while other management does. At the same time some are more lenient on schedules than others. It all depends on which location you work at, and what values you hold onto."
PetSmart,1f56273os308d000,2.0,Not enough staff or time to get the job done. Irregular schedule and working with people who hated being there. Out of touch upper management who look down on employees.
PetSmart,1f54ve4u6u2n1800,1.0,"Not supportive to you, deletes your online enrollments, they want you to be on register and you have no time to prepare for classes, do training paperwork and ylu have to share your space with the PetsHotel but receive but I was told they would sell boot camp classes for me, they have done none. Management sucks, and I recieve 20% commission when I do 100% of the work"
PetSmart,1f53a3cbmo1kn800,2.0,I've never seen so many managers in and out in a company. My Store leader is very arrogant and likes to be intimidating. So many good employees and managers left because of his lack of leadership  skills.
PetSmart,1f51qripfo1kn800,4.0,"I worked in the Petshotel ""Mostly overnight shifts""  I've never had so much fun in a workplace. The dogs and cats were amazing and on the overnight shift you can work at your own pace, as long as everything is done by the am shift, everything is cool. You can play music and hang out with doggies all night..."
PetSmart,1f51mdn8ko1kn800,3.0,"Generally, PetSmart is a good place to work. I have found that the company sometimes works on too many priorities at the same time and is very slow to provide the resources in terms of headcount needed to get the job done. You have to know when to say ""I can't get to this right now"" PetSmart can be a great place to learn because you get involved in a lot of things. Can you get promoted here? Yes, but it can take longer than you anticipate. It is also according to how your department operates and some have their favorites, making it hard for many to get opportunities to advance. The company does a good job at recognizing employees through cash awards and a points catalog. As far as remote work, some leaders are old fashioned and think that if they can't see you, you are probably not working. There are pockets in the business, however, that allow remote work. You will find that most of the employees are pet centric which makes for a fun environment. All in all, I would recommend PetSmart as an employer."
PetSmart,1f51jl0equ3af800,3.0,"I have worked at Petsmart for 3 years. I've done some Hotel/Doggy Daycare work, cashier/floor work and I was a bather for a year and then became a groomer which I've been for 2 years. My biggest issue is rules seem to vary store-store & district-district. Also, corporate is very insistent on groomers and bathers overlooking themselves and forcing add-ons onto people, and the haircuts are cheap ($76 for a doodle is way too cheap) so it attracts some of the worse customers. Corporate seems to always take the customers side and not the employees side. I wish corporate would care more about making employees happy than making customers happy. You can't have happy customers without happy employees."
PetSmart,1f513umkou3af800,5.0,For a little while I really loved working there but I didn’t feel like I had a fair chance to be a permanent part of the PetSmart team and they agreed to work with my schedule for school but went back on that agreement when it no longer benefited them.
PetSmart,1f4v8mka62v72000,3.0,"The PetSmart call center was one of the easiest jobs I have ever had. Before the pandemic, they offered free food and many events which was super fun! Once the pandemic hit back in April 2020, they offered all agents to work from home which was also very convenient. The only thing I would say that Petsmart needs to work on is making sure all supervisors and leads were on the same page because sometimes everyone would have different answers and it could get confusing. I will say one con is it is hard to move up within the company and it can get competitive. If you want to go for a leadership role you will have to go for it multiple times until you maybe get the position. You are basically waiting for a position to get announced and that can take months to a year depending on when someone quits and when you go for it the chances of you getting it are a 10/100 because everyone goes for it so they can get off the phones. Also some supervisors are willing to help their agents grow within the company and help them as much as they can where as other supervisors don't care as much which isn't one hundred percent fair. I noticed many co workers from other teams got promoted but none from my team did. I think all supervisors should guide each agent to success and help them grow within the company fully because that is very important. However all of management was very friendly to me and helped me when I needed. When covid restrictions have been lifted the past couple of months, the call volume has increased big time since everyone is trying to go on vacation so there is about 80 calls"
PetSmart,1f4v6q50ou392800,3.0,"Was a fun job, but corporate limited our resources due to budget and hired, in my opinion, some very unprofessional people due to, I’m guessing, desperation. Pay isn’t that great. I worked a lot of the same shifts on holidays each year. Eh."
PetSmart,1f4v6fs3ku39f800,4.0,Expect you to do the work of 3 people good staff and nice people though opportunity for advancements the pay is not that great really good start for people wanting to be in pet care a trainer or grooming. Customers always right attitude though it is what you make it.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1f4aqjq77u392800,4.0,"Not bad, but good for a first timer. The customers are usually friendly and understanding. The managers I had while working were horrible and had no idea what they were doing."
PetSmart,1f48davapnpjm800,3.0,"Working in the salon as a bather is super fun and rewarding- excellent part time work that is guaranteed to keep you in shape. But when they push you to be a groomer and then ask you to groom more and more dogs to make more money, it becomes way more stressful and way less fun. If you are a good groomer then you'll be fine. If you are more worried about dog safety and aren't confident in yourself, then I suggest going elsewhere. Petsmart, as a company, sees you as a cog, not as a person. It's also impossible to get time off during the holidays (seriously they won't allow you to). 50% commison or base pay for groomers. Have to meet sales goals and add on goals."
PetSmart,1f47n8v9ru20v800,2.0,"Grooming for a corporate owned grooming business just isn't worth it. They do have good health benefits and vacation time. No one really really appreciates being there though, causing a poor work environment"
PetSmart,1f47mfvvgu1vt800,1.0,Hands down the *worst* place I ever worked. Worked in the grooming salon. We were always understaffed and overbooked or flat dead and had to work the store to get our hours.
PetSmart,1f4763s5unpee800,4.0,Enjoyed being around animals. Most people were good to work with. Didn’t like being judged by customer reviews because people will complain and seldom give good reviews.
PetSmart,1f46c8bbru20v800,2.0,Temp job only. Corporate and managers give very little respect to animals and customers. Hire people to sell you product instead of how to truly care for you pet. Dog trainers are a joke.
PetSmart,1f468q6t2npee800,5.0,Great place for a starter job in school to learn responsibility. Managers were friendly and helped me tremendously. They were aware and considerate of my school situation
PetSmart,1f455kb59u1vt800,1.0,A lot they drill into you is false information like nutrition. They cater to suck ups and allow rumors to spread. Expect to much if you're good and don't bother nagging if you're og lazy
PetSmart,1f44rhfiss7ju800,3.0,It's hard to get full time and most of the workers are part timers only so not much benefits. You do get a discount on purchases made in store but thats about it.
PetSmart,1f44ovdcvt5di800,2.0,I liked working for PetSmart but they didn't give me a raise even after two years. The managers were great but they all left at the same time so I did too
PetSmart,1f43kuufvt5di800,2.0,"I like many other people turn 18 and immediately want to score a job at Petsmart. I would not recommend it if you are an animal lover, You are required to give sick animals medication without any type of training, when i asked for training on doing so, i was told to figure it out. Many of the animals that come in are sick, or have neurological issues, so this was an ongoing issue. You get trained for 1 day and are expected to know everything right off the bat, and are made to feel stupid by management when you ask how to do something."
PetSmart,1f41vnbllu1vt800,2.0,"I worked in the grooming salon. Clients were amazing, working with dogs was rewarding and a lot of fun. If you enjoy the dramas of middle school and the clicks that are there then this is the job for you! The supervisor talks about other employees with their co workers and makes the whole vibe feel like your working with a snarky high schooler, she also plays the pay back game if u miss a day she takes all ur requests and moves them off ur schedule. Very stressful and not very professional."
PetSmart,1f40d6o7cu1vt800,1.0,"When I started the pay was sub par but expectable and staffing was alright if a bit thin. Since covid cooperate has cut hours and benefits reducing stores to less than a skeleton crew. Staff must dot he jobs of 3- 6 people is multiple departments at the same time. No overtime is allowed and non meal breaks are discouraged due to the lack of coverage. Most employees are so exhausted and overworked that burnout is inevitable. The environment is soul sucking, employees are punished for customer complaints when enforcing cooperate policy. Schedules come out 3-4 days before the next week if your lucky. Callouts are constant as well as no shows and you are expected to drop everything to cover."
PetSmart,1f3vtclaeu20v800,4.0,Must stay on top of giving a good care of the pets & the pet parents . You're not only worrying about delivering service to pet's but also the pet parents who also make sure you're delivering excellent customer service to them .
PetSmart,1f3vnhbp8s7ju800,3.0,"I worked for Petsmart briefly as an order selector. Picking rate was difficult, and I had to work harder there to make rate than I had to work other places to earn bonus. For the workload and number of hours demanded, my base hourly rate was uncompetitive. Out PITs were old and poorly maintained to the point of sometimes being unsafe. Management cared about safety and employee welfare, but good management alone cannot overcome bad company policies."
PetSmart,1f3v9peivu1vt800,3.0,My honest opinion is of you love animals and care about their well being regardless off the species this place is for you. The satisfaction you get from helping people on a daily basis is incredible. Nonetheless the knowledge you take away every day is mind blowing.
PetSmart,1f3u24htpu20v800,1.0,"I worked at PetSmart with some of the smartest and hardest working people I've ever met. I started as a sales associate who also did early morning work stocking and transitioned into pet care later. Almost everyone I worked with shared the same goals of taking care of the animals, customers, and the store. Our store was perpetually understaffed, mostly due to a very high turnover rate and a lack of hiring. Assistant managers had high expectations but were understanding, while store management's expectations ran from punishing to ridiculous. Rarely were employees allowed to leave at their designated times, often staying 2+ hours past when their shifts were expected to end. A culture of fear developed wherein store and regional management were abusive towards assistant managers but outwardly kind to associates, which led to intense mistrust. I do know that since I worked there the manager I had has been fired, but only after every single employee at their new store collectively approached HR and threatened to quit. Local management is far from fully to blame for problems; corporate goals and policy shifted constantly. Obviously retail is a fast paced and ever changing environment, but expectations were already unrealistic. Adding huge store changes only served to make daily work impossible. One coworker would work every day, from open (4 AM) to well past close, sleep in their car, and do it all again, and were berated for not working hard enough regardless. My store was the highest volume store in our region, which may have influenced my experience, but unless substantial changes"
PetSmart,1f3tueib4npee800,2.0,"I worked at two different locations at petsmart. Both locations were in Arizona. The first store I worked at was phenomenal. I had amazing managers and coworkers. However when I moved to the other store, everything changed. I felt like I was apart of one of the high school drama reality shows. From the moment I started working there, rumors were spread about me, there was constant drama between managers and employees. Managers really need to be more understanding of their employees, while also not playing favorites and taking only one person's story into account. A lot of the issues that played a big role had to do with management, but nobody ever wanted to complain due to potential retaliation."
PetSmart,1f3tr393su1vt800,4.0,"It’s a fun job. I monitor over 20 dogs but I get to play with them, which is great. I clean up after the cats and dogs and bathe them. I love being around different breeds of dogs. I’m always learning something new everyday."
PetSmart,1f3r6vb6qt5di800,4.0,Fun place to learn. Good place for you 1st job. Good job for pet lovers. Friendly coworkers made job ez. Pay was sh**. but i would go back as a 2nd job.

PetSmart,1f3r2rn3js7ju800,1.0,"Everyone who works there is burnt out. The corporate office make decisions regardless of what’s best for us at our location, and there is no direct line of communication from my supervisor to corporate. Petsmart cares about profits, not their people."
PetSmart,1f3qb9bqqu1vt800,4.0,"Stressful but otherwise fun. Good training and pay but there were a lot of rude customers, maybe even more than working at a restaurant. But seeing animals would make it better."
PetSmart,1f3m2ekf2u3bc800,1.0,The manager sucked and was the most judgmental and probably just shouldn’t have been a manager at all. I got worked way too much compared to everyone else and got paid very little for what I was doing. And I hear that from other previous bathers who worked at Petsmart at some point. Just not a good place to go. Find a mom and pop and you’ll learn so much more and be so much happier trust me.
PetSmart,1f3lg76pl3guf000,4.0,Working in the pet hotel was hard work but the animals were great. Management could be rude sometimes but intolerable.
PetSmart,1f3ksjs93ocr1800,1.0,Terrible management and horrendous animal care management never scheduled enough people and tried to get coverage last minute. Hours were terrible. Either almost 40 hours or almost none at all.
PetSmart,1f3hk0agcu3bc800,4.0,"Managers are great, was like a family there, except for the grooming salon. You feel like you have room to move up. Of course like any pet company you are sometimes forced to sell animals to people who will for sure neglect them and that sucks."
PetSmart,1f3go0t7qocr1800,3.0,"This was a good first job for me. Working part time when I was younger I was introduced to customer service, managing inventory, and general pet care. It’s retail so you get the boring days and the stressful days, the great customers and the terrible customers that’ll ruin your day. But overall it taught me a lot and was a good introduction to my professional career"
PetSmart,1f3emreotu3bc800,2.0,"I worked as a dog bather and the work wasn’t difficult but with the volume of dogs that come in that we have to bathe and groom, it can get very stressful. On top of that, I only got a 30 minute break that wasn’t exactly guaranteed everyday especially when the salon is booked and you’re getting phone calls and walk-ins all at once. Great manager and excellent coworkers made it bearable but the pay is just too low."
PetSmart,1f3dju1evu3bc800,2.0,Petsmart Is a good place to start if you want to groom.
PetSmart,1f3d8k6d6ocr1800,3.0,I worked in the doggie day care. You are in a room full of dogs by yourself for 5 hours at a time. It gets very boring and repetitive. You must love dogs to work in that department. It’s a good first job for young people but I wouldn’t recommend if you went to learn to learn new things. If you like a routine then stick to it.
PetSmart,1f3auqmj9u3dj800,1.0,"Lots of hard work with very minimal help.  The managers are stuck in their own worlds and do not pay attention to their new employees who are still learning.  Management was hostile, and completely unfair.  Zero support and I personally felt very discriminated against.  Excellent employees, TERRIBLE management."
PetSmart,1f39dgokmu3bc800,5.0,Very demanding and intense pressure to get sales. Always have to perform. The pet parents and animals were the best part of the job. Upset management could have been more supportive.
PetSmart,1f393qou5o29g800,3.0,I worked in the Petshotel and while working with dogs everyday is fun there is also lots of stress for little pay. I'ts a great job if you plan on working there for a short time but you will burn out quickly if you work there for a while.
PetSmart,1f38js89tu3bc800,3.0,"I worked front end and salon during my year of being at petsmart and it’s really cliquie, at least my store was,  don't get me wrong I liked working for petsmart but sometimes you didn’t feel valued for the work you do."
PetSmart,1f36s31b9him2800,2.0,Management was on our backs constantly about performance numbers in the grooming salon and expected us to get huge or misbehaving dogs out in less than 2 hours. Other groomers gossiped behind your backs. Loved working with the dogs though.
PetSmart,1f36209htu1v3800,1.0,"I been working at PetSmart for over a year as a Pet Stylist. I came with experienced which was a $500 sign in bonus which was nice,  at first they said I would start as part time and then move up to full time, that never happened and everytime I asked about it Manager gaved an excuse or said I had to improve some stuff, as time went by I improved what they asked of me but they still wouldnt give me the full time, the customers that show up at the store where very mean and rude towards the employs as customers are entilted,  the environment is fast paced and very stressful with loud noise in the background the dogs are always scared of coming in even if we try to calm them down its not possible with all the noise from the backroom where they dry the dogs. The bathing area is filled with mold and it stinks and I would tell them it needs to be clean with clorox or some other product to get rid of mold and Managers dont listen to you."
PetSmart,1f353aviqhim2800,2.0,"Managers mingle with employees and sometimes date, even against policy.  I quit because of this reason.  No room for advanvement.  They want want want, but dont care if your ok in life."
PetSmart,1f34ti5nj309g000,3.0,"Although the job itself is very tiring and very much a retail job, the pets and their parents make the everyday drag fun and something to look forward to. I didn't have much support from my upper management when it came toward the end of my time at the company, but my co-workers were lovely. I did watch multiple quick and what I felt were unnecessary changes in the staff, along with being passed over for a promotion for an outside despite being totally qualified for the position. If you're looking to spend YEARS trying to get to where you want to go in the company, maybe this is the right place for you."
PetSmart,1f31kroad3h8b000,3.0,I was given very little explanation on what my duties would be and how to operate the cash register. A few of the Managers were frustrating to work with. They frequently sound inconsiderate.  The job was easy enough and some what relaxing butt as time went on it felt more and more unfulfilling.
PetSmart,1f30qhck9him2800,3.0,I love working my job. I just feel like it could be better. Management needs to improve. Treat people right and just maybe employees would stay longer. I know I don’t like to job hop around. I guess that’s why I’ve been here so long (off and on)

PetSmart,1f30g6n1qhim2800,2.0,"I worked here as a college job for several years. The people I worked with were lovely, but upper management saw us as expendable, basically. Harassment by customers was virtually ignored and we were continually understaffed, meaning lots of double shifts and having to come in on your day off. Zero employee appreciation, scheduling vacation was difficult and you were guilt tripped frequently. I would not recommend working here."
PetSmart,1f30eqm753h8b000,2.0,"If you’re exposed to COVID 19, then they want you to get a Covid test before returning to work. HOWEVER, they don’t want to foot the bill. Earning less than $10, including all the bills that I still have to pay, on top of a Covid test being $600, I couldn’t pay it, and they refuse to. This company hasn’t ever cared about their employees. They just want warm bodies to fill their store."
PetSmart,1f2uoavmo3ki8000,4.0,"PetSmart is a great job on paper and everyone seems friendly on paper but at the end of the day it is still retail. You are running to a lot of the same nonsense however if you have a great store/salon manager, you'll do fine. Its still one of my favorite jobs and it is a great company"
PetSmart,1f2rs8la52v5r000,1.0,"It was a terrible place to work. Nothing but people who didn’t care and had nothing to say to you. People would ignore you all the time and offer no help. But if you don’t help someone else when it is busy, it is the end of the world. Terrible job. Everyone pretends to be nice and is just rude."
PetSmart,1f2rnds2chim2800,3.0,It's a corporate company so just like any company it has its good things and it's bad things. You like working there or you won't.  You never know what you're going to get from store to store you don't know if there's going to be any consistency.
PetSmart,1f2r9gr5uu1v3800,2.0,"They were not accommodating with my schedule, I worked there for 7 years in the grooming salon. Management treated us like we were red-headed stepchildren. This includes my store manager and district manager. I had such high hopes for pet smart. I thought they were a good company. I did not like how other groomers treated the dogs jerking them around and it was just sad."
PetSmart,1f2pqj202u1v3800,5.0,This was such a fun job. I worked with the animals and helped people out who needed help with their pet needs. Management and coworkers were nice. Sometimes cleaning the animal habitats was super tiring but other than that it was fun. Can’t complain much.
PetSmart,1f2p2pb5n3ki8000,4.0,"Overall, as a manager. It wasn't a bad company. It was fun, every day was different. At the time I was there, they micromanaged and nitpicked some things, but they may have eased up since going back to private vs public. There were a few store manager changes in my time, and that was really what made or broke your time there. My one manager was extremely supportive and made the store fun. A newer manager made it a miserable tight ship where you did no right. The pay for the amount of work and time could have been better."
PetSmart,1f2no294r3h8b000,3.0,Forced Overtime and they push you about numbers when everyone is to tired from the Overtime to be productive. Used to be a fun place to work before covid
PetSmart,1f2mvfoopu1v3800,2.0,"Good pay but draining. You have a robot in your ear that tells you what to do and you do it. There is no difference in your days. You line up to clock in, get in your pallet rider, and go where the robot says. The boxes you need to put single pieces in will all disappear after break. The slip sheets disappear. And you're on a time limit. It's not hard, it's just numbing. You'll spend your days off dreading coming back."
PetSmart,1f2mbu0cahim2800,2.0,"Good luck moving forward in this company without cross training into more than 3 departments and also moving stores. The goal of this place is to drain you of as much as it can before you give out and quit so it can hire jn the next victim. Multiple promises if promotions, raises, more hours but none of it ever came."
PetSmart,1f2kfb1kb309g000,1.0,"I worked my way up from a part-time employee to a full-time leader position. I did what was required of me at all times, even went above and beyond to help cover extra shifts when associates call out or don’t show up to their scheduled shifts. Some days I worked 12+ hour shifts in order to help out “the pack.” You’re constantly told you’re doing a great job and that you’re an excellent addition to the team. Except when it’s inconvenient for the team. Constant drama and bickering amongst the employees. I have a degree but unfortunately petsmart pays me more than working in my actual field of study. I’ve tried to mention to management that I’d like to move up to a corporate level position, seeing that I feel that I’m ready for it. But I’m told I’m “too young” and that I’m perfectly fine where I’m at. No opportunities to move up within the company. I don’t want to be a leader for 25+ years before being considered for a corporate level position. Everything is great and you have an advantage, until you decide to have a family. Schedule is limited and management becomes upset if you can’t respond to emergency incidents or help cover a shift if somebody calls out. Management is always micro-managing what you do, they don’t let you run your department without some sort of negative input. You can’t hire employees without consulting with the district leader first. It’s an extremely stressful company to work for, if you’re at the retail level. Management also takes your words and twists them to better fit their stories, putting you at risk of losing your job. Also, if you try to call out"
PetSmart,1f2kevg65u1v3800,3.0,Petsmart as a company is a decent company to work for. They offer great benefits and try to offer incentive to employees by offering little snacks in the break room. The store management is where the company issues lie. They don't follow through with maintaining a fair work environment. They work the hard workers past their limits and let the slackers slide on by. There is absolutely no drive to continue to work hard because they don't encourage it.
PetSmart,1f2ipo76r3ki8000,4.0,"i liked working here a lot but had to quit when i moved. it’s a great starter job, working as a cashier. you really get to know your regular customers and it definitely fosters a sense of community."
PetSmart,1f2i4khn8309g000,1.0,"Unless the store goes under new management, do not work here. Management doesn't care about you. No one is ever written up or fired, the work environment is toxic and abusive, if anything is broken it takes months to fix or they slap a patch on it, and management doesn't follow the rules set by corporate (especially if it's an inconvenience to themselves)."
PetSmart,1f2hqgir33ki8000,2.0,The pickiest realm of retail there is....animals and people's pets. Drives you nuts. The pay is horrible. Management doesn't stick around. Customers are the worst
PetSmart,1f2fhfjgb3h8b000,1.0,Not much good coming from this company as a whole. Just a pay check for most til they can find other work.
PetSmart,1f2d1fch5him2800,4.0,"I enjoyed helping customers seek the best products for their pets and also selling their pets to them. I also enjoyed caring for all the fish, reptiles and small mammals but corporate will only do so much for them veterinary care wise which is sad."
PetSmart,1f29dqek03h8b000,2.0,"If you deeply care about animals, this is not the place for you. The company only cares about money but they constantly claim how much they care about the animals for sale in the store. Yet they force us to house too many animals together, sell them to anyone, and provide less than basic care to them. If you try to change anything for the better, even if you are using your own money (for fresh vegetables for the animals for example) you will immediately be shut down. Not to mention the pay is garbage and loyalty means nothing to them. Animal retail is a very dark place and not a good fit for anyone who struggles with depression and/or really loves animals."
PetSmart,1f294go7c3h8b000,2.0,"Most stores are really understaffed, you only get benefits if you're management. Most of your opinions or thoughts on improving the store go unheard or they listen and tell you it is a great idea then never implement any of your suggestions. The petcare department is completely overworked and under appreciated. The distribution center never has supplies we need to run the store.. There has been no really safety PPE rules for customers during COVID. We are not allowed to make them wear a mask only suggest it. Basically if you like just working for a paycheck this job isn't for you. Instead of coming to work and doing just your job you end up doing other people's work on top of your own responsibilities."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1f28lat1l2v5r000,3.0,I have heard that it depends on your salon and they can be very cliquey. I am lucky to have great coworkers but management can be iffy and they have cut my hours before without warning or explanation. Working in the salon can also be stressful as dogs can be unpredictable and basically if they aren't aggressive at check in we are expected to take them. You can always choose to send a dog home if you aren't comfortable but sometimes you feel judged by management for doing so.
PetSmart,1f270uvg23h8b000,3.0,Very unorganized. You will have three managers all tell you to do something different. You can’t do three things at once they will get mad at you for not doing all of the tasks at once.
PetSmart,1f253f5qk2v5r000,1.0,"The fact that the management knew nothing about the animals and their care, along with how poorly they treated the employees that actually knew what they were doing was insane. There was a lack of communication and a clear difference in treatment of employees, they pick favorites. They do not allow you to call off for anything and instead demand you find replacements for your shift but will still mark you as a no call no show."
PetSmart,1f2068280u3hv800,1.0,Petsmart has a way of taking a job that should be rewarding and fun and turning it into work that has you crying in your car on the commute to and from your store location.
PetSmart,1f1usjh29t4cq800,2.0,"It get fairly busy most of the day, I feel overwhelmed and overworked by being the only cashier in the area. Coworkers don’t help, they just stand around and talk."
PetSmart,1f1ui8grmnph7800,3.0,"I was excited to work at Petsmart as I love animals and would go there often to just hang out and look at the pets for sale. After extensive online training I was thrown onto the register since I had cashier experience. It was fairly easy to learn how everything worked there but the register systems are pretty old. There is rarely anyone working on the floor, it’s usually only a manager, a cashier, and a pet care associate. Extensive organizing and cleaning at the end of night and morning stockers have to be there at 4am even if it is very cold or snowing"
PetSmart,1f1tg028vu40q800,5.0,"I have been at Petsmart since November 2012 and have never enjoyed working at a place as much as here. The management has been great, the people I have worked with have been great and most of the customers are great as well.  Im always encouraged, feel important and feel like i make a difference in the company. I have fun at my job I love love love being there."
PetSmart,1f1r318d6u3hv800,2.0,"People who were tenured were being paid less than new hires. It was unfair and the managers won't budge on money, not least when I worked there. They also would change the schedule and not let associates know. I also would come in 22-28 pallet trucks and told to finish it in 8 hours, when it was technically supposed to take 1 hour per pallet."
PetSmart,1f1qil0cku40q800,1.0,"Management is horrible, all they care about is how much money you make, always short staffed especially in the salon. Been working here for 2 years and would’ve quit by now if they hadn’t forced me to go to academy and sign a 2 year contract"
PetSmart,1f1o8m4u5u3hv800,3.0,"Co-workers are awesome. Managers are alright. They go through them quick there, so don't get attached. Don't get too attached to your job, either, because you'll be moved around the store to different parts whether you like it or not. I was Pet Care. But I was barely ever in that department by the time I left. I was cashiering, stocking, inventory, customer service. You do not get paid extra to use your own car to take animals to the vet. You do not get a company vehicle to take them either. Management pays you as little as possible for as much work as possible. Variable hours, too. One week I would work 35 hours, the next 14. No consistency. No say on holidays. No bonuses."
PetSmart,1f1nslqmhu3hv800,2.0,"Could have been an okay place to work, if not for management. Was told to stop helping customers so much. Favoritism runs very high in the company. Its an okay place to work, but not long term."
PetSmart,1f1nsc5mpu3hv800,4.0,worked there for four years and never got to advance past associate lead. you don’t have much say over the animals in your care and can’t deny people animals unless they specifically say they plan to feed a hamster to a snake and even then depending on the manger they may say it’s okay
PetSmart,1f1ne8d0mu3hv800,4.0,"I was a groomer at Petsmart and would have stayed for years if I didn’t have to leave due to personal medical complications. The management at my store was great, always encouraging and helpful. My co-workers in the salon were all very nice. We were a team, and everyone helped each other when needed. There was also plenty of opportunities for growth."
PetSmart,1f1m9mlbat4cq800,3.0,Management Is horrible. I was hired as a seasonal worker but was told seasonal workers always end up being permanent. I called in to get my schedule one week and they said “oh you’re no longer working here” super unprofessional’
PetSmart,1f1m08ghgu3hv800,2.0,"Management, especially above the store level cares much more about their numbers on their scoreboard than animal or employee health.  They did pay decent with great benefits."
PetSmart,1f1lj13kpu3hv800,4.0,"No words, I honestly loved working with the pets and coworkers were really respectful and friendly. Pay was ok can't complain at all. Take the job if you feel it best suit you."
PetSmart,1f1l7e1uau40q800,3.0,"Pay is terrible for the amount of work you have to do. Injuries are very likely. The pets are wonderful and make the job enjoyable, but after so long it’s too stressful. Too understaffed."
PetSmart,1f1gmoevnu4vp800,3.0,"My experience at PetSmart. The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive. The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1f1e9v831s7nl800,3.0,"Working in the petsmart grooming salon it was very isolated compared to the rest of the store which was both good and bad, but in the end there was always drama, and with so few people in the salon it was rough being dragged into it a lot of the time."
PetSmart,1f1dhc7vot4q6800,1.0,"Although they gave good hours, the management was horrible and condescending. They were not flexible with the fact that I am a college student and many employees that had been there a long time left during my short time there due to the rude manager. I had to leave due to their inflexibility with my college schedule even though they knew I was a college student when they hired me. They don't want you to leave the cash wrap even when there is no one there and you will get yelled at if you do. Definitely do not work here, it is not worth it."

PetSmart,1f197b93ht4q6800,4.0,"Was a groomer for 5 years. Wasnt a bad job as long as I kept my head down, made lots of money and didnt question anything. Not a lot of room for growth and can be a very drama filled workplace."
PetSmart,1f15srn7et4q6800,4.0,Overall good. Standard retail job. Customers tend to be pretty understanding. Corporate makes things hard when they leave you short staffed. For a retail job it's great
PetSmart,1f15so5bvn56c800,3.0,"I was employed for 13 yrs. with PetSmart. I loved my co-workers, my clients and my dogs! Only negative is no support from management. They promise to help you out, but don't. No discipline for people who do wrong, weekly."
PetSmart,1f159l82vt4q6800,5.0,This was a great job for me I was retired.  I enjoyed the pet parents and seeing all the pets come in.  There is room for advancement and they take the time to train you.
PetSmart,1f14c21pmnpj1800,3.0,This job is pretty chill.  A lot of regular customers.  Co-workers are all pretty nice.  It gets boring sometimes when it’s slow.  The pay isn’t that much.
PetSmart,1f143h8h8t4b9800,2.0,"Seems like you go through a lot of managers. You either get ones that care about you or ones that want you out the door. The ones who don’t care will make you feel like you’re walking on eggshells. As a groomer, cutting a dog is something that can easily be done especially if you’re new and still learning. But they’ll over look that and make you feel like you are about to be dropped. Tell you things like “maybe pick a different career” You seem to get criticized more for your mistakes than what goals you’ve actually accomplished along the way. I wish there was more of a way to express your concerns to the district manager without having to go through your store manager which is who I have the most problems with."
PetSmart,1f13qn3hst4q6800,3.0,Company provides you with ample amount opportunities given you put in the effort. Fast paced with the best past is getting to meet the animals and to get to know their pet parents
PetSmart,1f11n6484n56c800,5.0,I interviewed for a petcare/customer service associate position. Management told me I would be trained in both then move into the grooming salon as a dog bather. All of my shifts for the last four months (out of the 8 months I have been employed at petsmart) have been cashier. I have not had the opportunity to gain the necessary knowledge I need to successfully carry out all duties pertaining to the petcare position. Therefore I have not had the opportunity to progress into the grooming salon. Management has been made aware of the situation and has been very slow to remedy.
PetSmart,1f108kgcts7jc800,1.0,"This place has way more downs than ups. Upper management is pretty much a joke at most stores, and when you try to tell the person above that, you get dismissed."
PetSmart,1f0vaft61npl8800,3.0,"It's alright. You get to work with some pretty cool people. Management is.. questionable. Your work is never really appreciated, more expected than anything. Doesn't give you a sense of motivation. If you raise the bar one week, you're expected to work at that level afterwards. If not, questions will  be asked. The team working inventory basically run the store. They do about 90% of everything that goes on. Props to the inventory manager for taking 99% of the heat for any little thing wrong with the store."
PetSmart,1f0uvm2lk3o8h000,4.0,Some drama but that’s to be expected. 99% of the team is amazing and supportive. I work half in the grooming salon and half on the floor. Each side has its pros and cons.
PetSmart,1f0sfiqoinpl8800,3.0,As a bather/cashier it was a relaxed and fun environment to work in. It could get stressful when it got busy and there was a lack of other bathers but overall it was a chill job.  Didn't like the drama though from all other employees.
PetSmart,1f0s5kfipnpl8800,3.0,"I loved getting to see the different pets and pet parents that came through our doors everyday. Learning new facts about animals was so much fun. Work was not very difficult. Sometimes you would be asked to do more than normal but you didn't always have to. My co-workers were very friendly and nice. The biggest problem PetSmart has is its company attendance policy. You get 3 absences per year and that's it. Pets dies? Well they may love pets, but not yours and still expect you to show up in a great mood. Get Covid-19 symptoms, which they instruct you not to come in if you have? That's not counted either. They wouldn't even write down what your excused absences were, so I never knew what were ones they should have considered excused and which ones were not. After 3 absences every absence is a strike. 3 strikes you're out. The expectations are ridiculous. Its okay for a short time but if you have sick family or struggles yourself, don't expect to stay long. Oh and they only send you to the bathroom on break."
PetSmart,1f0s01urls7jc800,3.0,"Worked with good managers for most of my time. Then when the company was taken private and sold, they sucked the life out of good people. The demands became unachievable and morale suffered irrevocably. Pay was taken away (managers going from 45 to 40 hours within their store). Bonuses went away because goals were unattainable. All they did was pay off execs  and remodel after remodel. Stopped investing time and money into the amazing people they had in stores."
PetSmart,1f0rn5nrj3o8h000,2.0,This is a dead end position. Management is unhelpful and there is no challenge or growth opportunity. It is fun being able to meet all the pets that come by
PetSmart,1f0n1ssk9sa7q800,3.0,Good place to work to learn how to become a groomer. Free training and ability to make good money.  Although there is a contract to sign.  It’s okay.
PetSmart,1f0mmdau5o1hv800,1.0,Working there was completely awful. I was promised a promotion that was given to someone else. I felt very underpaid for my work load. I had covid in December /January of 2019/2020 and they made me work even though I had a doctors note excusing me from work
PetSmart,1f0lispebnpl8800,3.0,"Store manager is absolutely amazing! I honestly don't think I will EVER have a better boss; the assistant store manager on the other hand, is why I no longer work here."
PetSmart,1f0l8br7en54g800,1.0,"Managers are very manipulative and disrespectful. While I was working there, I got sick and had doctors notes exempting me from certain things and management didn’t abide to the drs notes. I was diagnosed with cancer and when I let my management know, one laughed and said I was making it up to get out of work."
PetSmart,1f0krpul2sa7q800,3.0,"Your experience heavily depends on your management.  There were highs and lows based on the higher ups. If you have a supportive manager and team, you have the potential to have a great experience with upward mobility to a point."

PetSmart,1f0i7pmi1npl8800,3.0,Worked as a dog bather the managers and cooperate did not care about their employees all they cared about was how many dogs you can groom and how fast so they can get their bonuses. Which is not safe for dogs or the employees.
PetSmart,1f0hgt1ca3o8h000,2.0,I liked most of the people I worked with. Managment definitely plays favorites. The company doesnt really care for employees or animals. You dont need to know anything to work there and employees constantly have false information on animals. After covid started they fired our cleaner so we had nobody to clean the store. The company only cares about money.
PetSmart,1f0hf9hld3o8h000,2.0,"It is a productive, heavy work store. But you always see beautiful  animals so the time flies there when you’re working, Helping customer all the time is so nice... What I didn’t like is the management cause didn’t Appreciate it all the hard work that you do to have the store nice.. They didn’t give me any compensation for 14 years of hard work"
PetSmart,1f0hc4jvs3o8h000,4.0,"I do enjoy working at Petsmart, and have learned a lot while working here. I do wish there was more communication between management, and compensation needs to improve with all associates."
PetSmart,1f0h84au5o1hv800,3.0,"Petsmart takes great care of the animals there, but all the training is on computer and there is little on the job training. You just have to figure it out as you go along. Day Camp feels like you're in there to entertain the people watching you rather than take care of and entertain the dogs in Day Camp. They also have a really hard time firing bad workers and the management has no accountability for when they're doing their job poorly."
PetSmart,1f0fvscntn54g800,4.0,Never seemed to have enough people to work a truck. People always called in forcing you to pick up their slack. Management never has enough hours to go around so they have to work us like mules to finish assignments.
PetSmart,1f0f5mv7rn51j800,1.0,"Very toxic work environment, I wasn’t paid enough to do the store managers,assistant store managers job and the mils jobs and not being able to do my cel position. Constantly was degraded in-front of customers because I couldn’t find time to get my job done while trying to do everyone else’s. Always walked on egg shells because I never knew what mood the store manager was going to walk into the store with."
PetSmart,1f0f2jfftt4qe800,3.0,"The animals are probably the best part about this job, I worked here for almost a year as a cashier/pet care associate and its your typical retail store."
PetSmart,1f0f0irjrnpfj800,1.0,"I was excited to work with pets. But it turns out, i was on graveyard as a janitor with no interaction with the pets. Cleaning all play areas, surrounding areas."
PetSmart,1f0eih704n51j800,4.0,"You get more hours the more you try and follow policies put in place. There can be a downside with dealing with the customer side of things since it is a retail environment. Customers can be hard to work with especially during this current pandemic, and the store is not given enough hours to help accommodate for curbside pick up. Sometimes there will be only one person on the floor with a cashier who isn’t able to really help out much so one person can be stuck doing curbsides, animal department work, stocking, and prepping the store which can be very overwhelming on a busy day. A lot of the customers will anticipate quick services when there is a skeleton crew and end up harassing the workers due to lack of staffing."
PetSmart,1f0c0sif6n51j800,4.0,"I worked at Petsmart for a few years and enjoyed my team because we all were supportive of giving animals the best treatment. When I pursued management, I was not allowed an opportunity to advance, or even told what I needed to work on to get there. Good job for a college student, or for temporary work as it can be a struggle at times but overall fun if you’re not in too deep"
PetSmart,1f0bv2dc9t4qe800,4.0,Greeting pet parents and their pets and trying to form bonds with them would have been the best part of the job had we not been in the middle of a pandemic.
PetSmart,1f09v2sc4t458800,5.0,At the particular Petsmart I was employed at it was very nice and professional work environment. Management deserve to be treated better given the district manager gives unrealistic goals often.
PetSmart,1f09010j2t458800,4.0,The grooming salon is a fun place to work however it does get overwhelming and there are a lot of demands from the company. Very hard to find time for lunches and breaks on the weekends. It is mostly about the money but if you make it fun and have good coworkers it is a great job.
PetSmart,1f07vlt5qsa1j800,3.0,"It really depends on what management is like in the store. I worked at one store where managers cared and worked WITH their team. Animal care was fantastic, shelves were clean and stocked, grooming was run well and safely. I’ve also worked at other stores where animals were sick and dying left and right because staff didn’t care and management didn’t care or follow up, shelves were disorganized, planners were months behind, food on shelves was expired/recalled but left out for weeks, tanks had more dead than alive fish, and management did nothing about it"
PetSmart,1f0733319306b000,2.0,"Top manager was terrible! People would call out left and right with no repercussions and I would have to work extra & pick up the slack! Hours were cut without warning if the manager making the schedule didn’t like you or thought you weren’t a good worker. Overall terrible experience, I only stayed because I needed the money & didn’t want to go through a lot of interview processes. The pay was also average and unfair some people made less than others just because they didn’t speak up about pay at the interview."
PetSmart,1f04rrv69u4d4800,4.0,"If your in school then it’s good, but if your looking for money and a long term job then no? Great with school and you do learn a lot about some animals, I learned a lot from customers experiences"
PetSmart,1f03tcp8mu4d4800,3.0,"Corporate expects one person to complete the workload of three people. Management in the store was great, but under a lot of pressure to meet deadlines and increase productivity with no staff. They're more concerned with silly catchphrases and metrics than keeping shelves stocked. I moved on due to lack of opportunity for advancement and no training provided for the role I was in. As a store that sells animals, they do take excellent care of the animals and the people that work there truly love pets."
PetSmart,1f031rhbisa1j800,3.0,"lots of walk ins and phone call disruptions, can get really hectic during the weekend, some dogs are very dangerous but some days are relaxing and calm with well behaved dogs."
PetSmart,1evvuperpn5bi800,5.0,"Great work environment and good rotations on schedules at my location. Pet care is the better position in my opinion.  Learned a lot about animals, how to care for them, and what brands are healthy for the specific pet.

PetSmart,1evuljt7h306b000,5.0,"People care about you and your family at the PetSmart DC.  Paid time off, pay for performance, and leaders who build relationships with their teams.  There is work to be done for sure and 100% is expected, but the atmosphere is such that your team and supervision help us to succeed in your daily work and balancing stuff going on outside work.  Plus, business has been growing lately so plenty of opportunities."
PetSmart,1evtng82ksa1j800,4.0,Liked working here a lot just make sure you get a good location some managers treat you better than others just make sure your on time and if your stocking don’t let them make you do it alone or you will burn out fast supposed to be a team effort find them puting a lot of responsibility on new employees not always fair
PetSmart,1evqidukes7kr800,2.0,I had a terrible onboarding process and very rude boss that didn't take the time to train me at the corporate office. Please be sure you really feel a good vibe towards your direct corporate direct report.
PetSmart,1evqcra7i26a4000,5.0,Management was always so understanding and working with the animals was a lot of fun. I was laid off due to covid-19 otherwise i would still be working there. Very friendly environment
PetSmart,1evqa4ve3s7kr800,3.0,Nothing special.  It was a job.  Average warehouse/ distribution center.  Don't expect to much from them and they don't eclectic to much in return.  Decent
PetSmart,1evo6riicn52h800,2.0,Management doesn't care about you. You are under payed and unappreciated. Lazy employees. No benefits at all.
PetSmart,1evo1t187n52h800,3.0,"Been working for PetSmart for only a few weeks now, at first it was fun. I enjoyed learning new things about the company but I was just thrown in without any real training. I trained for about an hour and then was thrown into a shift to cover for someone else. Management was okay but did not take into consideration the max number of hours I said I could work."
PetSmart,1evmdlsooocao800,1.0,"I hated working here, they wouldn’t even let you use the bathroom.  Management disappears for hours, it takes them forever to show up if a customer wants to talk to them."
PetSmart,1evl4ufudn52h800,2.0,"Things were never amazing at Petsmart, but the company really dropped the ball the last year or so. We never received hazard pay, our bonus for giving them their ""best year ever in sales"" was $275 BEFORE they taxed it, and they failed to hire on enough people to get the work done. We've been mandated each week, working 50-60 hours since about July. Management only cares about their own bonuses and about moving up; you're completely disposable. Look at all the orange vests on the floor (new hires) and you'll see proof of the turnover rate there."
PetSmart,1evila0oasa8h800,5.0,"I loved working here. Decent pay, cross training available and there are always opportunities to advance in the company. The entire staff is very easy to get along with and all have very good morals and we all worked as a team, it didn't all fall on one employee. I rarely had a difficult customer. I would still be there if it weren't for my health issues and the COVID pandemic."
PetSmart,1evht7bmm26a4000,1.0,"A good start to a day always turned bad at Casselberry location, payroll wasn’t entered correctly more than multiple times.. great company! Poor management! Period!"
PetSmart,1evg9n78nnpn0800,5.0,I call this my therapy and you get too meet alot of people and their pets.  Great people to work with as well.  You get discounts on the products and in grooming.  The vets are great as well.
PetSmart,1evdv9qern51t800,1.0,"Recently, my mom was in the hospital (the icu) and I needed off. They wouldn’t let me have the day off. They say they care for their associates but they don’t. I worked in the grooming salon and everyone except for my salon leader, who was guilt tripped into stepping down, was always talking about me behind my back but never confronted me to my face. Management is terrible. Overall work environment is very toxic. I loved my job, just not the people I worked with. I will never again work for petsmart. Definitely not worth the stress everyday for how little you get paid."
PetSmart,1evdlkug4t5h3800,4.0,It was O.K. I feel the pay should be more. You do not get enough time to clean up and restock at the end. I did not like how on my break I would be sometimes called back to help!
PetSmart,1evamlbt926ak000,4.0,"I absolutely loved being able to help care for and learn more about how to care for pets, what is required and recommended for care of pets, as well as learning about how to best help customers and teach customers the best way to care for a family companion. Some of the associates and managers hired can be iffy, but staff can also be amazing."
PetSmart,1ev9giuvhn55l800,1.0,"They don't care about the animals or employees, only the bottom line and HR is the biggest joke I've ever dealt with. Written up for doing my job and what was asked of me twice. This place is not good."
PetSmart,1ev9cn2rvn55l800,4.0,"Fun job it was a good time. Good job for the summer before college, I enjoyed the people I worked with along with the flexible hours that were available."
PetSmart,1ev6ad2d4npjs800,1.0,"Management is poor with this company, lack of communication. No one seems to be on the same page. There is not an opportunity for growth for a career, as they tell you in the beginning when you start. I was top performer and was never considered for promotions."
PetSmart,1ev64pguin55l800,3.0,"The work is incredibly taxing on the body. They don't want you to sit while on your shift, which is 8 hours or more. You have to be able to lift and handle heavy dogs so it's tiring work. However, I'd rather be interacting with the dogs than the customers, so it's good for that. The pay is less than I'd like for the amount of stress you're put under."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1ev5tb563npna800,1.0,"Working as a pet groomer for 5 years. Seen all types of management through this place and it is run horribly. Never expect to have a manager have your back or if you need something within reason it will not get done. Job security is not secure. If you cutt more than three dogs a year you are fired. This goes for new, trainee groomers as well and it always makes you feel like you are walking on eggshells shells. Not saying cutting a dog is not a big deal because it is, but accidents happen."
PetSmart,1ev5s1gj826ak000,2.0,"Pets are the best aspect. The associates will form clicks and if they don’t like you the new associate on the team, they make life miserable for that associate until they quit or get fired. The associates go out of their way to not work. They are rude to customers and can’t comply with simple requests like greeting all customers. They act like they are the all knowing authority on pets, and refuse to sell pets to customers."
PetSmart,1ev3ti1sst5ho800,3.0,Loved loved my management and coworkers. I just got really stressed with the work of being a dog groomer and balancing meeting customers needs. As we all know the customer is not always right and sometimes it gets hard to swallow that differing opinion. I also began to feel more uncomfortable and stressed working retail during this pandemic even though the company tried their best to figure out regulations.
PetSmart,1ev1h0ic0npna800,2.0,"The management often can be super stressy, which puts pressure on all of us who work in the salon. You're pushed to groom as many dogs possible, even if that affects the quality of the groom you do, or if you push the dog's stress level."
PetSmart,1ev14v6s126ak000,4.0,Not a bad place to work but you need to have compassion for animals that they sell and/or adopt.  If you're not an animal lover it could affect how you feel about working there.  Groomers need to be compensated mores.
PetSmart,1ev12rsd0n55l800,3.0,"I worked in the PetsHotel as an Associate Lead and our direct Hotel Leader was AMAZING and I loved the team I worked with. However the rest of management was very lacking. There was little reward for going above and beyond (which I did regularly, staying late into the night with sick pets at the vet), but we were very heavily reprimanded for anything we did wrong. Plus there was imbalance in pay. I found out that there were some Associates being paid the same as the Leads, when as Leads we not only did the same work as them but also much more. The store manager also regularly made us feel like our jobs were at risk, and while we tried to be there for the pets it very quickly became apparent that PetsMart cared more about making sure they weren’t losing money and making sure their policies were strictly followed, even if it meant endangering a pet’s life or risking them getting sick. It hurt too much for me to continue working there as I have a great passion for animals and I hated not being able to give them the care that they deserved."
PetSmart,1ev0tbndkt5ho800,4.0,"I worked as a seasonal Pet Care Associate, and although your experience will vary from location to location and manager to manager, I absolutely loved my time there. If the pay was better/I had been able to advance within the company I would've have stayed a good while longer. Coworkers were crazy fun, management was really patient and helpful. Awesome job for a summer worker or college student."
PetSmart,1euur9batnpna800,4.0,Solid company and I had a fantastic district leader who led with respect and professionalism. It can be a tough place to work and they often don't have the answers you need to meet expectations but given the retail circumstances its a good place to work.
PetSmart,1euun6d5126ak000,4.0,Pay is good as well as a lot of overtime. Room to move within the company and flexible shifts. It’s extremely labor intensive and you are held to a production standard based on a rate system.
PetSmart,1euudr3mnt5h3800,3.0,Most store managers are lazy and if you do a good job they want to keep you in that job and don’t want to give you an opportunity to succeed and move further in your career it’s all about what they can do to keep you in your spot so they can be lazy and sit in the office all day and blame all the issues on all the employees and take no responsibility themselves for anything
PetSmart,1euu1l5ha26ak000,2.0,This job never cares about the employees only about how many hours they can give you without breaking you. They never give you time off. All you do is clean up animal .... and get paid horribly for it
PetSmart,1eurqcppku1ki800,3.0,"The best part of my job is the interactions that i have with customers pets. Engaging with them and watching them grow is special. Even though work is stressful and most customers are not nice, the pets get me through the day."
PetSmart,1euqsaef83h8h000,4.0,Enjoyed the work and seeing animals daily. Not much support from other employees though. Some coworkers had attitudes while others were nice. Not the worst job.
PetSmart,1eupgd2coo15p800,3.0,Covid showed PetSmart's corporate office's true colors. They slashed hours even after seeing a stable increase in revenue during these times. They laid off loyal employees of 15+ years. Customer Service managers are often times stuck on the registers for 2-3 shifts a week due to not having hours for cashiers. Merchandising managers are working trucks completely alone so that their stocking hours can be used in the live animal department and registers.
PetSmart,1euon8819u1ib800,1.0,"Management is okay, except for two people you won't be able to stand, barely any hours, every day I walked in my anxiety shot through the roof because of the work environment. If it gets busy at the register, and you aren't somehow magically working freight with 5 customers in line at the same time then you get yelled at. I was switching to new meds and was yawning a lot cuz of the meds, our store leader got mad at me for YAWNING in front of a customer. We weren't allowed to discuss wages with fellow employees so they could pay unfairly."
PetSmart,1eunilevqo1i6800,4.0,When i worked first two years where good the last was horrible they changed management and it all went down. Not only did 1/2 the staff quite the cleanliness was lacking and the dogs where hurt by it. I hope it has bettered by now.
PetSmart,1eun2554ao15p800,1.0,"Here's a tip, if you do want to work for PetSmart make a manager your friend. Otherwise YOU WILL NEVER GET PROMOTED. we have a stocker who routinely works triple what the stocking team does ( four other people) put together and instead of recognizing the hard work he's done over the years they promote a manager's buddy. Don't work here unless you absolutely need the money."
PetSmart,1eum14i713h8h000,4.0,Started out as an orderfill employee. Basic training is given and is sufficient for the job. You are trained on an electric pallet jack with the standard headset for picking. Performance goals are easy to meet even when you talk to coworkers from time to time. Advancement to other positions are given to those who show hard work. My time there was enjoyable as I did my work and was still able to have a great work/home life balance.
PetSmart,1eulrndo2o1i6800,2.0,Coworkers always awesome and the pets. Management and cooperate is terrible! There care more for the $$ then the pets and employees. They allow customers to railroad the employees all the time.
PetSmart,1eukq1ecro15p800,1.0,They pay you nothing as the next person through the door gets more than you. You get written up for having a disability. Management is a revolving door. Requiring base peon employees to do every job in the store at any given time without training. Push you to move to another store without place to live or transportation or $
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1euknojchu1ki800,5.0,This company is awesome. They have helped me with a lot in my personal life. They care about you and your wellbeing. They love pets and pet parents. They try to help associates and customers as best as they can.
PetSmart,1eujou4gcu1ki800,4.0,"While the customers were always a bit of an issue, as they seemed to think they knew more than the professional groomers, nothing was as bad as the management in my old store. When I transferred, the manager was perfectly accommodating and the most helpful I think she could have possibly been, but my first location had someone who was completely useless at her job."
PetSmart,1eufp2l11u1ib800,3.0,Management was ok but could do much better with how they handled workers. Couldn't maintain them and had one employee rampage the store. Other than that not a terrible place to work in an interim situation.
PetSmart,1euaae5pro15p800,3.0,"Its a retail job, you're just a body until you move up, if you can move up. Then maybe you get a little more known, but you're still disposable. Ultimatly this is the nature of the beast that is retail, bottom line is everything. What makes it bearable are those you work with day to day."
PetSmart,1eua6jhhcu1ki800,2.0,"The co-workers were really nice and likable, and the discounts are definitely a plus but in the end that's about it. Training is very minimal so you kind of have to teach yourself or spend a lot of time running back and forth asking questions. There are definitely too many chiefs and not enough indians. On top of that the company rules are also a bit rediculous, and you can tell the higher ups don't have ANY real knowledge on animals what so ever. Its a good job if you're in a pinch and don't plan on staying long. During the pandemic I barely worked 8 hours one week and was one of the only employees to actually receive hours. On top of that days off mean practically NOTHING since you'll probably just get called in anyway so your personal life is pretty much out the window. Its not the worst place to work but not exactly the best."
PetSmart,1eu9hrhuho15p800,3.0,"I love working with animals and the people in my direct department, however pet parents have so much leverage even though they don’t know store policy"
PetSmart,1eu921elvs7gh800,5.0,Hardest part of the job....... and the management. What you learn and how to get through each day. Keep your head high and push through its all worth it.
PetSmart,1eu8uqk7bs7gh800,4.0,"Petsmart is a good place to work. You have the ability to move uo in the company. However, their care for the animals they sell is very lax. The store I worked at didn't train very well. I was mostly thrown to the wolves in hopes I'd survive. They would answer any questions I had, but for the most part, I was on my own. Their ""care sheets"" for the animals are more for the company's pockets than the welfare of the animals. Their pet care manual for the animals does not line up with the care the animals actually need. HR will fire you in the blink of an eye for any reason they want. The customer is ALWAYS right (even when they're harassing you, you can't defend yourself)"
PetSmart,1eu6npr4bu1ib800,5.0,The Hours were good.  The Management was great.  The Customers were fun.  Every thing about Petsmart was good.  A place anyone could be proud to work at.  I had family issues that I had to address and had to quit.
PetSmart,1eu6ml17gu1ki800,1.0,Management is terrible and doesn’t care about you. Salon is filled with toxic people. If you care about your mental health save yourself the trouble.
PetSmart,1eu3d9tuuo1fo800,4.0,Avoid  the call center.  Manager don't do much to help  you grow. They micro manage you all the time. QA is very nit pickey and a joke.  People  are on right ups all the time.
PetSmart,1eu2avbav3kh5000,1.0,"i worked for the company many years and it was only when the company sold was when it went down hill. cut jobs, put more work on leaders. animals get neglected because ""customers are more important"". some managers are dictators. health insurance went to garbage. overall company doesnt care about the associates or the animals. just making money"
PetSmart,1etv5rvmlosn9800,1.0,"Working in the salon you never get time to take your breaks, always leaving at least an hour late due to constantly being overbooked. Constant drama in the workplace it is like being in highschool again. Constant negative energy from clients about prices and corporate rules that i have no control over. Just extremely exhausting and makes me hate my job when i always used to love it. depressing."
PetSmart,1etud22avu221800,3.0,"Worked there for 4 straight years worked extremely hard to be good at what I do. I helped fulfill the sales plan for management so they could get their precious bonuses and was fired for bringing my personal dog to work.  When it's in or policy we can bring our own dogs, therefore,  the higher ups do not care about you they don't care to hear an explanation ""I don't think you're being very truthfull"" is what I was told.  Pay is good if you can upsell and from 8vdogs a day just mind your business perform the groom or bathe the dogs and everything should be good."
PetSmart,1etsbridsu312800,3.0,The company became money hungry and began to care about their huge profits rather than the pets and people who provided their income. The culture devoloped a lie based refusal to accept responsibility.
PetSmart,1etpr304du312800,1.0,You will be treated unfairly. Production standard continually climbed to near impossible quotas. Bathroom breaks were even timed. Lifting heavy products all day.
PetSmart,1etpkpdpsu312800,1.0,"Worked there for about a year. They force you to stay over time. Understaffed. Work you like a dog for minimum wage. You also have to pick up dog feces all the time and the base staff is very competitive. Also, they make you work in pet care and answer questions you know nothing about."
PetSmart,1etnptuvht50r800,4.0,"I worked on the cashier and did stocking sometimes. Pretty cool, can get busy but nothing I couldn't handle. Nice working around different pets all day. One customer even came in with a little finger monkey!"
PetSmart,1etllu42lu221800,3.0,"Job was okay. But, you can tell from the import of animals through trucks that they were not well taken care of. They come from large factory breeding facilities. They may care about dogs/cats, but they do NOT care about any other animals. Profits>animals."
PetSmart,1etipbe5gu221800,3.0,"You do so much besides grooming which can be extremely stressful and your a number not an individual.  You answer phones, make report cards before covid,  make appointments, check in and out dogs which may be other people's,  clean, wash your dog,  and groom. Oh but focus on dog and be safe."

PetSmart,1etinh06eu312800,1.0,Was incredibly underpaid for the work that I did. Managers weren't the best and didnt care. They schedule you outside of your availability and if the manager is mad at you for something they will purposely not schedule you for weeks on end. They have major favoritism amongst employees. You only get a 10% discount. Short breaks and no employee appreciation.
PetSmart,1etia9diut497800,4.0,Enjoyed most of my time there. I work there years ago as a Pet care manager and enjoyed what I did. Management team was overall really good.  Dm's always kept amagement in edge.
PetSmart,1ethvm6jet48m800,2.0,Horrible  just too long to write no one got permitted within the grooming department it ALLWAYS came from a different location ALLWAYS people applying and getting the job and quitting  so we had to train every new never getting a raise or anything they wouldn’t take you take time off of you had a child that was sick and poor management
PetSmart,1etgrd8kio29g800,1.0,"they drive out their good employees by working them to the bone and promising them opportunities for advancements that never come. since covid they have also drastically cut hours while piling work onto the remaining associates, management is breathing down your neck while offering zero pay incentive for doing the job of 3 people. horrible communication skills with management and they gossip about the associates they are supposed to be leading. the people that do get promoted are either a byproduct of playing favorites or an outside hire. After 5 years I have lost all respect for this place."
PetSmart,1etfp5p76u4fd800,3.0,"I greatly enjoyed my time working at PetSmart. The wide variety of dogs that I got to work on was always fun as I am a bit of a sucker for animals anyhow. The only thing that drove me away from this job is because you do not get paid enough in my position as a bather to compensate for the hard work that it is. You always risk getting bit by the dogs, the work is physically demanding as there is no time to sit and you often have to lean over dogs to work with them your entire shift. The way you feel after you work varies wildly as somedays you may get all dogs that are well behaved and very patient and other times you may get large dogs that want to bite or fight with you, and thus you leave very exhausted. Customer service is a forefront in the Bathers position as you must welcome customers into the salon then carry out a list of procedures such as checking over the dog for overall health. I am the type of person to enjoy a lot of new and exciting things in a job so as not to get bored, so this job was very enjoyable in that regard. If you really like to keep busy, this is a job for you."
PetSmart,1etfm2ll8u4fd800,4.0,"Getting back into working after kids, I was glad to get a chance.  I loved getting  to know our return customers/pet parents, I had a great work team & my supervisors were  wonderful.  Experiences will be based on location!!"
PetSmart,1etf9f1m8s7an800,3.0,"It's retail, and all retail is hard but working with management and ""animal people"" is another ballgame. People that spend 65 dollars for 20 pounds of dog food are on another level."
PetSmart,1etcnp4aiu1n1800,3.0,"I wouldn't work here if given a second chance, The bosses are very hatefull, and when your trying to do your job you get pulled away to do something that isn't anywhere in your job and then your force to stay there when they come back and do something else forgetting your even there."
PetSmart,1etbq9o2lpi26800,1.0,They literally couldn’t care less about you there. The management is terrible and all over the place. The managers are extremely bias. They put their work on you.
PetSmart,1et63ivriu1lf800,1.0,"Management decisions were strictly for the companies favor, they did little to nothing in favor of their employees, you're replaceable in their mindset.

PetSmart,1et4rmauut48t800,2.0,Poor communication skills between the management and the associates. Management let personal opinions cloud their judgement. Poor scheduling. Lack of coverage around the store
PetSmart,1et2oubo4u1n1800,3.0,"It's just another corporate job. They don't really care about you and push you to get email captures and all that jazz. I loved working with dogs, but the people? Not so much. High expectations low reward."
PetSmart,1et25g9cdu1lf800,1.0,"Since covid has hit its become obvious how little the company cares for its employees. People inside the store are not the issue. Horrible customers are babied, and allowed to continue their awful behavior. Every day we are at risk for covid and the best we get is employees wear masks, and customers /should/ but it’s not exactly enforced. They’re just asked to put one on. I’ve known several co workers who have just been laid off, even after loyally remaining with the company over 5 years. We end up doing the work of 3 people for half the pay. Employees are forced to feed into the companies scams that earn only the managers bonus pay. This company is a load of bull that does not care for their employees. If they did, we’d see better work life balance, better pay, and better treatment. Think again before you work or shop here."
PetSmart,1et1g4dml2v81000,2.0,"PetSmart has abandoned it’s employees in the wake of this pandemic and  does not enforce social-distancing or proper mask wearing. Stores are allowed to become overcrowded, increasing likelihood of a spreader event."
PetSmart,1et0v3qlou1lf800,3.0,I enjoy working here for the most part but it does not pay well compared to other jobs in the surrounding area. I was promised close to full time hours (around 38) when I was hired but have since been given 20-25 because they keep hiring people when they don’t actually need them. Corporate has too much control over the stores and payroll. This is a good job for a young college person who needs a little bit of money but definitely not somewhere you should be for a long time. Even the managers don’t make very good money even though PetSmart can very well pay them more.
PetSmart,1et0dknjnt5l4800,4.0,I was mainly a cashier but also helped out on the floor. Its a fun job if your co workers and management are good. Most times its dealing with customers. Customers are usually nice but every now and again you get a few that make your job very difficult. There's also a 15min or 30min break depending on how long your shift is. Its very busy so lots of standing up in the same place checking out customers repeatedly. Every now and again you get to pet a dog or feed it treats while you check out the pet parent. Scheduling can also be unpredictable and inconsistent.

PetSmart,1esg74ml63ois000,1.0,I enjoyed bonding with the pets and the pet parents. I enjoyed taking care of the pets making sure they were clean and healthy also presentable to the customers.
PetSmart,1esftsif0t4l7800,5.0,I loved working here! Watching and playing with the dogs are great but it may be a lot at times. You get to learn all about body language on dogs and cats as you work there. Youll get to meet different breeds of dogs and pet them. Eventually you could cross-train after a few months. The hotel staff are so welcoming to be around.
PetSmart,1esdq8b38npub800,5.0,Season was great but they let me go the day before my birthday and one of the managers just asked me for my birthday and favorite animal it was crazy but it’s life
PetSmart,1es9fu4b3s7mj800,4.0,"I started at PetSmart as a Dog Bather. The Salon Leader I had at the time was very helpful and taught me a lot. The pay was pretty good for it being my first job as well. Dog bathing can become pretty stressful. Especially during the holidays. Anyways after a year I decided to become a Pet Stylist. The way the company has the pay for Pet Stylist, is ridiculous. Hourly until you complete a certain total of dogs. Which I believe is 200. Then you receive commission. Which yeah it's great for building clientele, but if you work in a new or slower salon it feels like you are working yourself to death for little pay."
PetSmart,1es9eekpft4l3800,2.0,"Not a very supportive environment, can be toxic and stressful with inconsistencies with management. Working with animals is great, and you can learn a lot. But your advancement is soley dependent on management and their willingness."
PetSmart,1es8hofo6s7mj800,5.0,"Fairly good teamwork situation, job tasks very well laid out (checklists for everything!).  Definitely a good temporary job - there is little opportunity for advancement, especially for females."
PetSmart,1es8ginkas7mj800,2.0,"Petsmart as a corporate could care less about employees. For example, during covid we were open the entire time like other essential places and received zero hazard pay. We also began doing curbside pick up and received zero for the new additional work. You have to deal with so many things and they expect you to execute so many tasks for very little money. Cleaning, dealing with idiotic customers, running around hecticly, being in a smelly dirty environment, are what you should expect."
PetSmart,1es7i386ru418800,4.0,Enjoyed working at petsmart. It was fun working hands-on with animals. Didn't prefer one of the many managers and leads. Sort of unorganized crew but not a terrible part time gig
PetSmart,1es4vdesmu418800,1.0,It might be a job that you get paid. But it's it really worth it? Isn't your mental health more important? Do you like being sane and enjoying your life? Don't do this to yourself. Run. Just run away while you still can.
PetSmart,1es4mrarmu418800,5.0,Loved working with animals here! I loved seeing our animals and clients' animals here. The hours weren't bad and management was pretty good. They cared about my wellbeing and success.
PetSmart,1es4fcsoe3ogl000,4.0,"Overall I love my job a lot. I work in the salon and have a lot of genuine love for the people in there with me, I have learned a ton at my job, and I genuinely enjoy what I do even if it was not what I was expecting to do when I moved to the area. My store operates very well, my only complaint is the corporate pressure. My store itself is great and could be just fine on its own, but the stuff we are forced to do by corporate inhibits my ability to do my best at my job. It’s a lot of pressure over things that I feel are pushy and irritating to customers, but since it’s the high ups you have to listen to them and nod your head and go along with it. I can deal with it, but it would be so much better without that weight over your head."
PetSmart,1es2fna9bs7mj800,1.0,"Profit comes first in every situation, it's all about the bottom dollar and looking good for investors (they want to take the focus off the fact that the company is tanking). Employees are expendable, loyalty and seniority mean nothing. Associates who have worked there 15 years are routinely pushed aside to make room for fresh faces. It's fun when you first start, but management must take advantage of employees and ring out every last drop of energy in order to meet goals set by corporate fops who don't understand the day-to-day struggles of working in the retail and service industry. Associates are written up for 1 minute of overtime, but are expected to do double the workload of what is humanly possible. Breaks are nonexistent. Employees regularly work through lunch and after hours but are not allowed overtime pay so usually clock out and go back to work."
PetSmart,1es1dr15f3ogl000,4.0,"It's a good place to work if you love and animals, and assisting people with their pets needs. If you're not a people person this isn't the job for you."
PetSmart,1erv3b68p3ogl000,1.0,Petsmart is HORRIBLE they treat thier employees like garbage and will openly tell you your disposable. Store level management cant be amazing but above that are all terrible. This is the most soul crushing company ive ever worked for.
PetSmart,1erv1vkv1s7mj800,5.0,"I myself love dogs and love to wake up for a job where I get to take care of pets. I worked in the PetSmart Grooming area. I was there for a very short time, but it was the best job I ever had. The team was wonderful to work with and be around in general."
PetSmart,1eruch75enplu800,5.0,I love petsmart they are a kind and loving place. The management is stellar and I wouldn’t take my pet anywhere but to them because they love and care for them like no one else.
PetSmart,1eru9m5u52v70000,3.0,"There is very inconsistent oversight by upper management. Many protocols not strictly enforced so the employee experience is profoundly different location to location. Store leaders/district leaders make or break the experience. I've worked with some amazing people over the years that motivated me to be my best, and I've worked with some who made me want to stop trying."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1ertvdba9u418800,3.0,I love working with the animals and dealing with the customers. Unfortunately we got the manager that came over from Target.  It could be a better run organization if they really wanted honest feedback from the employees.
PetSmart,1ertt8s0e3ogl000,1.0,it was ok until corporate forced management turnover and then became one of the worst companies to work for. it seems to be true even to this day from what i hear from current employees even if it’s been years since i’ve worked there.
PetSmart,1erslj2tesa99800,5.0,"It’s a great job but it’s more than just petting dogs and some people don’t really seem to think about that before apply, it can be stressful but overall a good job"
PetSmart,1ers30jcnu1sr800,4.0,"Worked here for 15 years.  Loved it up until I ended up having to work everyday including on my vacations.  Got to be overwhelming.  I miss the environment, co-workers, pet parents and the pets most of all."
PetSmart,1errovh1esa66800,2.0,Management is horrible . Also did way to much work for what you do hates it. You ask for help and you never get it . You get treated horribly . When people say I would love to work there I tell them run
PetSmart,1erjinhfksa99800,4.0,"I honestly loved the work I did with this company. I got to love on and take care of exotic pets daily. Dealing with customer questions and concerns was challenging and rewarding. My biggest issues came in the low wages. Some new hires were being paid more than me after having been with the company for almost 5 years. One year I only got an 8 cent raise...who does that? I was promised on more than one occasion that I would be trained as a lead for an open position at my site, then was overlooked for an outside hire or an internal promotion of a teenager."
PetSmart,1erj0n4lho2gt800,2.0,"I worked in grooming, management doesn't care about employees and training is poor. You work hard for little money. I had good co workers but the company overall lacked professionalism. They treat their groomers like children."
PetSmart,1erib3jqmsa99800,2.0,"When I first started I was under the impression that the salon and everyone that worked in it made plenty of money but I quickly found out that that wasn’t true. Working as a Bather was exciting at first because working with dogs and puppies seems fun but then it’s not. As a bather (at my store) I was looked down upon. All the dirty work fell to me. I would close the entire salon by myself Almost everyday. I went from doing 5-6 dogs a day to 13+ without any warning. I felt overwhelmed and overworked all the time. The pay is absolute garbage. While every groomer brought home at least $800, some making up to $1400 a week. I barely made $300. The amount of work that I did and how hard I worked that was like being spit on it’s insulting how hard bathers work and how little we're paid. I found out that I was making petsmart $1000s a week (more than some groomers) while I was only being paid $200. The management basically told me to deal with it whenever I confronted them about my pay. I loved working with the dogs but I hated how I was being taken advantage of. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone because you are literally the salons slave. I hope it gets better but I doubt it will."
PetSmart,1erhhsu86sa97800,4.0,"I worked at 3 different stores, and they varied based on management and coworkers. The first store was my first job and I always felt appreciated and got along with my coworkers for the most part. The job can be boring at times, especially if you are constantly stuck on the register. However, I was able to transfer stores with ease, and move up fairly quickly."
PetSmart,1erg5eiubo2gt800,4.0,"Poor management throughout my store, but I'm a petstist, make 50% commission and work very hard so I'm a happy camper financially. I've spoken with corporate and it seems to be a great company to work for but it isn't necessarily reflected in the actual stores."
PetSmart,1erdhs16ho2gt800,4.0,"It was a good job, great coworkers and a place to get to know shoppers in your community. You have regulars that you get to know and their pets who you bond with. Coworkers can become friends for life but despite everything it's still retail. High expectations, some rude customers, poor consistency with management, poor hours and little flexibility unless you've been around long enough to earn it."
PetSmart,1erdap7jto2gt800,4.0,"It's a great temporary job for people with little to no experience, who love animals and enjoy getting to learn about them. You don't make a lot of money in the beginning and they expect you to do more than a normal office/9 to 5 kind of job. Expect to clean, learn to work the registers and assist customers with everyday questions. Most of the staff is friendly, so definitely ask them questions when you aren't sure about something."
PetSmart,1erb4hmbvsa99800,4.0,Typical retail problems. Not enough hours for people to be where they need to be. Pay was decent for any leads but GM was always overworked. Company takes short cuts long term for store well being
PetSmart,1erav9gbhu35m800,3.0,This is most definitely a starter job that I would work at while young. Management was ok and coworkers were fun to work with. Overall nice people to work with
PetSmart,1era3k2f9u49m800,2.0,"It was okay but it got my foot in the door to work with animals. Management did not care at all about the animals. The hamsters all had wet tail, birds were stressed, cats in adoption died... just horrible stuff."
PetSmart,1era38jrtsa97800,5.0,My time here was awesome and I loved it! I loved working with the animals and my coworkers and management were wonderful. Everyone working here was really nice and really enjoyed their job. They put in 200% every shift. Unfortunately I needed full time hours and the pay was a little lower... had I been able to be employed full time I would have never left. It really was a great place to work.
PetSmart,1era36ji5u49m800,4.0,"In my experience working there, the job was very much enjoyable. The work was fairly easy, managers were always very helpful and had your back most if not all the time. Very laid back environment, hardly ever any stress except for inventory time of the year or the holidays, but that's anywhere. I only left because of a personal dispute, but had that never happened, I would've loved to have moved up in the company."
PetSmart,1era04rj0sa97800,1.0,This job started out great but it turned out to be one of the worst places I ever worked. The people that worked there were incompetant and extremely lazy. Nobody cared about the dogs all they cared about was where their next dollar was coming from.... Went through 3 salon leaders in 3 years and not one of them actually liked dogs or even liked their jobs. Upper management did nothing about complaints. Anybody that actually loved their jobs were smart enough to leave there.
PetSmart,1er8dhuqdu49m800,3.0,"I was a bather in the grooming salon, and I really enjoyed it at first, but they promised to send me through their grooming academy program to become a stylist, but it was easier for them to keep me where I was at, so they ignored me and refused to promote me. A family member of mine was suffering from cancer, and my first time calling out of my shift for going to the hospital with him, the salon manager told me to call my ONE coworker who was also a bather to cover my appointments for the day. After that, I turned in my two week notice, but I should have just quit outright. They don't pay you enough for dealing with large, rowdy, and difficult dogs, and I frequently got back injuries from having to bend over all day long to bathe and groom dogs that had to be tethered to the floor, since they were too big to fit in the tubs. My one store was bad, maybe others were better, but that was my experience."
PetSmart,1er806pfcsa97800,3.0,Bosses don't care about how you are treated. Just worry about getting your numbers. Constant raises for everyone even if they don't deserve it. Many lazy people just blocking production.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1er7r9bkau35m800,2.0,"Always worked overtime because we were understaffed. Pay wasn't worth my time. Always was about sales and never the animals. The only good thing was about the job were my coworkers at the time but after a few started to move on to better opportunities, my time there wasn't long either. Everybody was overworked and underpaid, including the managers."
PetSmart,1er7nigclsa97800,2.0,"All about the numbers and they do not care for their staff. They act like they do, but at the end of the day they do not. They cut hours to the bare minimum but expect the same results. Terrible company."
PetSmart,1er7ldmjksa97800,3.0,Overall ok place to work. If you are looking for long term with ways to move up you should go somewhere else. In a pinch they will at least give you hours to work.
PetSmart,1er59lcv2o2gt800,4.0,"If you have a love for animals, this is the place to work. I truly enjoyed working with the animals and getting to take care of them. Most of the associates strive for a good working environment and to provide the best care for the animals and the customers. The management in Twin Falls, Idaho is not the best, but is not terrible. Some management cares for its employees and other management can be toxic. The other downfalls to the positions at Petsmart is the pay and hours. I always strive to provide the best customer service and quality work. After a year of continuously asking for a pay raise or to become a full-time employee instead of part-time, nothing ever changed except for an increased work load. Now that I have quit my position there, I am making a better wage with less physical labor."
PetSmart,1er59btpmu35m800,4.0,Good company. Very busy pace. Lots of perks always complimenting you on good job. Safety conscious. Fair pay and ability to make a bonus check. Lots of OT
PetSmart,1er3fgcqro2gs800,1.0,"Overworked and underpaid, mistreated and talked down to, makes you miserable and unhappy, feels like you are spending every second of your time for no reward."
PetSmart,1er2vfhf4o2gs800,1.0,Constantly understaffed and extremely rude customers during rush hour times with no help from management. Very exhausting and constantly overworked. Doggie day camp worse job I ever had.
PetSmart,1er1su90ou49m800,4.0,"It was a great experience if you like working with animals and customer service. It's sad when you have to take care of sick animals because there's a 50% chance they can pass away even though they are treated by their own vet. you have to be strong willed to take care of these sick animals, otherwise emotions can get over you. I was a Pet Care Specialist and I love this job but the pay is what is low for all that I did, the rest was good from my 2 managers to the other peers. I  had a great time."
PetSmart,1er1lrjjpo2gt800,2.0,The team was nice and working with animals is great but overall management was below average. Only one person stood out as caring while the rest were no help at all.
PetSmart,1er0n157lo2gt800,3.0,I enjoyed my time with PetSmart. As my first job it helped me grow my skills in the animal field and laid down the building blocks for my own personal growth. The quality of your management team will greatly determine how much you like working here. Some managers do not care about the animals in their care.
PetSmart,1eqq4e6qqo2gs800,5.0,PetSmart offers great service along with great product and care.  The company goals and policies are fair and easily understood.  PetSmart takes care of their employees as well as the community.
PetSmart,1eqptn5q8u49m800,3.0,It was okay. Not paid enough for the amount of work required. That’s most places now though. The customers were great though. It did not feel team friendly.
PetSmart,1eqnk74dpu35m800,1.0,"I loved what I did but the drama was unbearable. Being a bather the groomers treat you like dirt and make your workload harder on purpose. When I talked to my coworkers about it the girls said it’s different when you become a groomer...  They completely work you to death and take advantage. Maybe I just had a bad location, but I wouldn’t recommend working as a bather."
PetSmart,1eqlk92f2u49m800,3.0,"Was a fun place to work when dealing with all the animals, but the pay isn’t enough. Good job for a part time of college student who is in need of flexible hours, but should pay more."
PetSmart,1eql5e338o2gt800,4.0,"I loved working with animals and dealing with customers. Manager is usually flexible when you want a different schedule, so that's nice. Had like 2 days off a week."
PetSmart,1eqhapq2io2gs800,2.0,"This is a good job for a teenager. Management has it's clicks and you have to be in that click to advance.  It's good for a starter job and experience but after you get that, move on. Pay is terrible."
PetSmart,1eqg6iu9ko2gs800,3.0,"management is a joke, pay is a joke. hours typically sucked. coworkers were usually cool since we all love animals. if you love animals and need a part time job this is for you"
PetSmart,1eq9epg08sa97800,3.0,Benefits were great upper management not so much great pay a week paid vacation plus sick days unachievable expectations from corporate task management not understood at higher level not enough associates working
PetSmart,1eq6pcd3psa99800,3.0,"A typical day at work was busy and stressful. The only enjoyable part was interacting with the store animals and customer's pets. It's decent for a first job, but the managers/customers can take a toll on your mental health sometimes."
PetSmart,1eq42utjmsa99800,1.0,There is so much emphasis on making plan that the employees are worked into the ground.  Coworkers were great and management tries their best but nothing can meet the high standards that corporate puts onto them!
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1eq3la8gqsa97800,3.0,very simple cashier job. Customers are the toughest. management is ok. the most enjoyable part is being able to see all of the animals come into the store.
PetSmart,1eq1ltbmcu35m800,2.0,"Don’t become a dog groomer. It’s a miserable career with zero advancement-that goes for almost all grooming jobs, everywhere. Little to no benefits and never get a raise because you are paid commission."
PetSmart,1eq13m8iasa99800,4.0,"This position (pets hotel associate) is great. It can seem overwhelming at first but you get into this little groove and know everything like the back of your hand in no time. It is so much more than interacting with animals though. It’s fast paced, can be very chaotic during peak hours/days and yea, it’s still retail. You will be dealing with pet parents just as frequently, if not more than animals! I think it can be a lot for teenagers/young adults (the main draw to this sort of job) to handle sometimes... But it makes for good learning experiences. As with any company management varies store to store but everyone at my location is awesome. :)"
PetSmart,1eq0ktl6hu49m800,2.0,"I was hired for the weekend shift, 3 12 hour shifts. Due to Covid they enforce everyone to work 60 hours every week. This destroyed the work/ life balance and caused issues in my schooling. They could’ve prioritize essential products such as food and medicine instead of toys and holiday products instead of overworking every employee."
PetSmart,1epvkns60sa97800,5.0,I love it! Great hours and animals. People were nice. I love all the new animals. Very chilled. They had a great grooming service there. Never saw anything bad.
PetSmart,1epvao70so2gt800,3.0,"Very fun to work here, but sometimes the communication between managers is not good, and you will get in trouble for doing what one manager says and not the other. You really need to listen to the head manager, if another one asks you to do something contradictory to the leader, tell them so as not to get into senseless trouble"
PetSmart,1epv5dvh4sa99800,4.0,Team is awesome.  Managers care about their staff and the pets they sell in the building. Sometimes we are not given the hours needed to do the job they ask from corporate.  Corporate needs to work in stores for a week to see the real daily activities
PetSmart,1eprtjer8u35m800,3.0,"I think it depends mostly on your store, I had some great mangers/employees, but also bad ones. There is a lot of focus on meeting certain metrics and some days you feel understaffed, especially when closing."
PetSmart,1epr1keqgsa97800,4.0,"I left because the new person who got promoted was too much of a mean person she was all about getting you into trouble so she could look good at her new position and get her friends in the job.So I left plus I felt really bad at how locked up the dogs would-be for months even.id never leave my dog at a place like that,they don't even get to go outside like ever thats torture especially those that are left by their owners there..it's really sad."
PetSmart,1epq5naa5u35m800,4.0,I enjoyed working in the Pet Hotel even though it could get crazy. We had a great team! Store management was poor and a revolving door. Store managers were not trained for Pet Hotel so they were never any help.
PetSmart,1eppfidm7o2gs800,2.0,After working at my location for 7 months I did not trust petsmart to look after my dog. While at the Petshotel people paid for their dogs to have private 15-30 min playdates and we only have them 12-15 no matter what. (Grooming was aways lovely though)
PetSmart,1epp9lvp4u35m800,4.0,"Started with bad original lead and management  and got sent to grooming academy unprepared. Came back to a new salon lead and is getting better.  It can be physically exhausting, as well as mentally. You must have patience and enjoy being around dogs. The pay in the salon is not good until you finish most of the training after their grooming academy."
PetSmart,1epokbi6po2gs800,3.0,It has its ups and downs. Like any job. You can bring your dog here which is nice. Pay is not enough though. The call volume can be overwhelming and the systems feel very outdated.
PetSmart,1epn7tft4u35m800,3.0,You learn a lot about petcare but it’s just another corporation out there to make money. Not so great benefits other than product discounts but the overall discount is sad. Stressful and dirty. The company should stop selling fish and small animals as the facilities are lingering with disease and disrepair.
PetSmart,1epmt3nvgo2gs800,5.0,"Even though I was only here for a short time. I LOVED EVERY SINGLE DAY OF MY JOB! I was sad to leave. However I am happy for the opportunity to have the experiences. I learned so much in the short time, and I will cherish my time with the salon staff and memories we made forever."
PetSmart,1epmha7a7u49m800,1.0,"I spent almost two years with PetSmart and hated every second of it. Management is terrible, you have to beg to take a 30 minute break after working for 10 hours straight. The way they treat animals is horrendous. I never want to work there again nor do I want to shop there."
PetSmart,1epm1arasu35m800,1.0,How is this company still open? This was the worse job I ever had. They don’t train properly they don’t treat pets properly they over work pay is horrid. They have poor ethics with animals.
PetSmart,1epkcn9tsu23q800,4.0,Loved working with the animals and adopting them out to good homes. Management was good and employees were very kind. Some annoying costumers but that's to be expected.
PetSmart,1epgfk2m4npl6800,3.0,"The management team at Lynnwood store is a do as I say, not as I do group. Most staff do not care about the welfare of animals, they are viewed as dollar signs and not a viable little life. The fish are ##constantly infected. Safety and sanitation procedures are not followed. Most staff are unprofessional behind the backs of eachother and customers. Young staff play on their phones constantly and do not like to be told what to do. They need a safe space to pout when they do not get their way. Management will write off store products from the shelves like can dog or cat food, then demand with consequences the staff solicit customers for cash or food donations.. Management talk behind the backs of staff and turn one against another."
PetSmart,1epcu8moanpl6800,2.0,"This job tends to rely highly on if management is good. The schedule can be flexible and there's some good dogs, but those are the only pros."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1epa9kd60u32a800,4.0,"Worked as a pet care specialist mostly playing with dogs all day. Day camp is from 9-5 with an hour break from 12-1. You will mainly be in camp when you first start but once you get the hang of it you’ll be out of camp cleaning, preparing lunches or dinners, and helping the front staff."
PetSmart,1ep9lem19u38g800,3.0,"It was too long ago to remember properly. I said that this was too long ago to properly remember, however the supervisor and management were hugely underqualified and had no interpersonal skills."
PetSmart,1ep4s032gnpl6800,4.0,"Back in the day, knowing ALL departments was a HUGE help; filling in when short staffed."
PetSmart,1ep4qk1bkt4h0800,2.0,Employees are trained to know all areas of the store entirely too fast.  This job would have been way less stressful if they trained an employee in one for department a week or two before moving on to the next.
PetSmart,1ep33iamlt4h0800,4.0,Sometimes rewarding. The amount of work that is to be done in the petcare department is not worth the pay.  There’s a lot of tasks to be done in a short amount of time while also having to help customers almost always on your own.
PetSmart,1eov6rj5snpim800,5.0,"I worked here for over 2 years and loved it, it was fun and I got along with everyone great. If I could have had. amore family oriented schedule i would have stayed"
PetSmart,1eotl7akku1e3800,2.0,Pay is awful unless you're a groomer or manager. You get passed over for promotions and the pay raises are a joke. They'll often schedule you to work closing and opening shifts and will take advantage of you whenever possible.
PetSmart,1eotfm1blu1e3800,2.0,"The work itself was fun, but the management was horrendous. Every month we would get a new manager in the store with new expectations. I was practically bullied out of my position and job in general. My coworkers were some of the best people I have ever met, but the management needs serious work."
PetSmart,1eon3mjvju1e3800,2.0,"Not sure if it's just my location but there was very poor management. Overall, everyone was nice but most of the time the store was on fire. Not to mention there wasn't enough compensation for all the work you're doing."
PetSmart,1eomupnp4s7f8800,1.0,The management and HR are HORRIBLE. They only care about what work is getting done. They also are really bad liars and manipulaters. They will fire you for using the time you have to go home wether if it’s for being sick or emergencies. Anything.
PetSmart,1eoka9tvnnpgr800,2.0,Petsmart only cares about money and forcing you to overwork yourself. They need to get their corporate people off the backs of the stores...and they don't care about you during this pandemic.
PetSmart,1eoj9ctgpnpgr800,3.0,learning to groom at Petsmart was ok. Nothing special. Learned the basics and safety protocols. Benefits were decent. They constantly asked you to do more and groom more.
PetSmart,1eoj8btp9u44g800,5.0,I loved working here. Great managers and enjoyable work. There is a positive atmosphere because people love their pets. Management worked with me and gave me good opportunities.
PetSmart,1eoj1ls2ju44g800,2.0,"The best part about working for this company was working with animals and building relationships with co-workers and pet parents. The company itself does not care or value you and make it very clear that you are replaceable, regardless of how hard you work. They are an insatiable company and never recognize accomplishments, only criticize the things that can be done ""better,"" or the things that you did ""wrong."""
PetSmart,1eohkb52tnpgn800,1.0,you’ll never be fully compensated for your work. petsmart is a selfish company that only cares about money. i worked in the store and in the salon and the ONLY good thing about the job were my regular clients (the dogs specifically because most of the customers were rude) and my fellow salon associates. i was treated horribly by core management and never received any support. A coworker of mine got really sick and couldn’t come into work (before covid) and they demoted her from being a groomer because of it. They only care about themselves. Don’t waste your time
PetSmart,1eogcbrs7u2j4800,2.0,"I will start off with, PetSmart has always been this much of a mess, this has not changed due to the recent pandemic. My store had new management very frequently and could not keep employees because of unfair expectations for employees not scheduled to work. If you did not come in when they called, you would be punished. The managers would often fight amongst themselves and pit lower employees against each other. Departments were poorly managed, never maintained properly, and safely regulations were completely ignored. I had to do several safety walks and was told by higher ups to falsify monthly safety inspections for store performance."
PetSmart,1eogc5i7tu2j4800,4.0,"I enjoyed my time on the front end as a cashier, especially seeing people bring their pets into the store. I learned a lot about different animal care in my five years there, and I eventually was cross trained as a receptionist in the salon. I loved being a salon receptionist, and it inspired me to eventually switch careers and focus on admin positions as a specialty. The customers and pets were the best part of this job. The schedule unfortunately fluctuated wildly from week to week, and the management was a mixed bag. Some of them were amazing, and others were petty and small-minded."
PetSmart,1eog0u5p7u2j4800,3.0,"I couldn't complain about pay or benefits. The overall job I enjoyed. The customers and routine wasn't bad. Computer systems completely outdated, EXTREME issues with management, training non existent, daily and weekly goals, though obtainable were placing heavy burdens on a single person, and again, upper management was horrible. I ended up quitting upset and furious and in turn was accused of stealing and banned from ever working for Petsmart again.  And it was truly upsetting because I worked hard and gave it my all only to be treated badly, mainly because I was female. Even though it was almost all women in the store.. except for the store manager"
PetSmart,1eofahs9pu1ae800,5.0,"Because it's not a super huge store it was a pretty easy job for stocking. We had our time in the morning before the store opened to pack out the truck, which was nice and uninterrupted. It was also a big plus having people like you, with a love for animals, to work with too."
PetSmart,1eoefn63uu2cm800,4.0,"I liked my job here until I got laid off because of COVID. I’d still be working there otherwise. My boss was very supportive and the people I worked with were great and friendly people. I pretty much worked side by side with the inventory leader to replenish the store. Got to wear my headphones, lots of independence when I wanted it and support when I needed it. But that’s all a tribute to my managers!"
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1eodlkglonpig800,5.0,"A lot of people believe that working with dogs is all fun and games, but it’s not. A lot of the time you’re in the salon, they’re are going to be dogs that are scared, it’s happens. They could be unsocialized or have had a bad experience at the groomers. You have to be comfortable holding dogs, grinding nails, etc. It’s a very rewarding job and I wouldn’t change my job for anything in the world, I absolutely love bathing pups, but it isn’t for everyone. I need to me patient and confident, especially since dogs can tell when your nervous. I would recommend this job to anyone who really wants to work with dogs, but it’s not the easiest job in the world."
PetSmart,1eoddr9e0npig800,3.0,"Worked here for three years. Gained experience here that I needed. Honestly, management makes or breaks the job itself. First two years loved my managers and enjoyed coming to work, last year on the job with new management made it horrible and many people quit. They make it easy to be able to work in different departments or move up, pay is not great and the raises aren’t great either. It is stable though and especially if it’s your first job. It’s retail mixed with animal care depending on the department you work in. Get to see cute animals  :)"
PetSmart,1eocut39os78u800,1.0,"Horrible work environment in the salon. They do nothing but talk about you and belittle you. There are definitely favorites among the manager and certain groomers who are allowed to do whatever they want to. It's like being in high school all over again. They never follow rules but expect you to follow them otherwise you get into trouble. When you talk to management, they do nothing and it only makes the situation worse."
PetSmart,1eocmuphou1lv800,5.0,"Department management is great, store manager was often hiding in the office and not involved with running the store. Learned a lot and enjoyed my time here."
PetSmart,1eocaa91as7aj800,2.0,Coworkers were nice and management was alright. There were barely any hours though and they didn't gave us hazard pay; other places were paying $2 more during the pandemic.
PetSmart,1eobfpqjdu2ju800,4.0,"I worked under a management team that was very good. I've heard stories of other locations having bad management, so that can vary from store to store. Overall, I learned a lot about animals working there, whether it be from my own research or from the (nice) customers that came in. I had a really good experience at PetSmart, but I never really got the chance to advance my career there."
PetSmart,1eo0ov1ico15h800,3.0,"You take the good with the bad here, I guess. Depending on your size and experience this may not be a hard job at all, but as a 90 lb person thats probably one of the first words I’d use to describe my job. That or frustrating."
PetSmart,1eo0dalbtt52k800,4.0,It was nice working here.  I worked in several different locations in different states over the years.  Every salon is very different. I worked under several very good managers and one absolutely insane store.  PetSmart tries to care about it's groomers but that can be lost when management wants you to continue working on an aggressive dog to meet the sales quota.
PetSmart,1eo0cg886npn0800,4.0,"Customer care of the animals is a lot of work and they should pay more. Easy going place to work. Management is great with working around your schedule, so its great job for students."
PetSmart,1enumc9smo15h800,1.0,"A terrible company filled with upper management that was borderline evil. It's almost like it was a requirement to work there. After they were sold, all they cared about was cutting hours and overworking their staff."
PetSmart,1enrfv2d0u2d6800,2.0,"After working here for about 6 months as a bather, I had to leave there were no real educators to teach how to properly bathe a dog and the leadership was very all over the place. We didn't have a manager and on top of that, the groomers would be rude and force the bathers to do stuff that didn't want to do."
PetSmart,1enr8plglo15h800,2.0,"I was an early morning stocker, which meant I worked with two other people to fully download the trucks. Problem is, management does not understand how quickly you are able to download the trucks and fully put out all the product. They have a 'math equation' to measure how long it should take you, but it is almost always off. Even if you are moving no-stop, knocking out carts left and right, you will always end up with one additional pallet that you just couldn't get to."
PetSmart,1enr4ht78t52k800,3.0,"The company itself isn’t too bad. It’s the management in the store that will make or break the experience you have there. With the store I was at, management only ever cared about their favorites and numbers. They were horrible with scheduling with school, would talk bad behind your back over simple things and will act rude and disrespectful if you have family issues going on. Most of the positions are part time so never go in expecting to get 20 or more hours a week."
PetSmart,1enlcaj40t44v800,1.0,Petsmart only cares about making money they don’t care about the mental or physical health of their employees or their animals for that matter. I would recommend not working at PetSmart unless you enjoy getting paid Bologna  money to do crazy amounts of job responsibilities.
PetSmart,1enkhnb0msaas800,1.0,didnt expect people ro be unprofessional. store was clean at least. i had less hours over time. they do run a background check and no they dont drug test. but could be different for each interviewee.
PetSmart,1enhrm3mcu2d6800,1.0,"Don’t stay here long. In all locations I worked at, favoritism and cliques run rampant and unchecked. Managers often cover their own mistakes and laziness by assigning huge amounts of work to unqualified departments and guilt newer employees into staying for longer shifts or coming in early/on days off. There’s a highschool level of hazing that happens within management and senior employees. If you aren’t immediately well-liked by the upper crust, you find yourself getting assigned janitorial roles — cleaning up all of the pet accidents, taking care of food spills, cleaning restrooms — and nonstop register shifts for 9 hours. Your shifts will consist of the least-liked managers and the least-reliable employees. If you’re well-liked immediately, you’ll find yourself getting pulled into the office for snacks, given advancement opportunities before they are posted publicly and offered more desirable shifts with more efficient coworkers. Advancement opportunities are extremely difficult to get unless all of management likes you, which often means answering phone calls on your days off and doing things that are way above your pay grade for no extra compensation. Employees are promptly thrown under the bus for any mistakes management or other departments make. I witnessed several coworkers get mocked or told they were lying during traumatic events such as illness, family/pet death, and accidents/injury that occurred outside of work. You don’t get paid enough for this."
PetSmart,1enfhpmi8o15h800,5.0,"Upon arrival at Petsmart, I admit it was alot to digest. Started as part of the management team. Which has been a blessing. Learning things as you grow. Management team is supportive. Corporate is supportive, as well as, DM. Happy to be a part of the team at Petsmart. Every day is an adventure. Enjoy working with the public, assisting with their pet needs."
PetSmart,1enf1rp1pu1vn800,4.0,"As a groomer, in my opinion you are paid well.  It's really based on what level of stress u can handle. You can groom 5-6 pups a day and it's breezy or you can do 8-10 dogs a day and feel the pressure. But don't think u are there to JUST groom. You will also be cleaning, answering phones, walk-ins, bringing dogs in and out and depending on management... they can be annoying....but that's their job. It's a great stepping stone into the grooming world."
PetSmart,1eneeh262s7gl800,1.0,There are many things that are performed that anyone with proper animal care knowledge knows are not in the best interest of the animals. Many of the managers don’t have knowledge or experience with 90% of their he animals being sold. Most small animals and fish come from pet farms so they come in sick.
PetSmart,1encfo18ju1gm800,1.0,Management

PetSmart,1enbnbnbknpgg800,4.0,"Working here is fun and never boring. Lots of different dogs every day so there is always something to learn. Depending on how busy the salon is, it can get a bit crazy at times so you've got to be up and running at all times."
PetSmart,1enbl8brbocq3800,5.0,Definitely a good place to work for those starting out in retail. Working in Petcare was extremely fun and you learn so much about the animals you sell!
PetSmart,1en9jq1nhnpf2800,5.0,"I worked at the petshotel for 6 months and I LOVED my job. The only reason I quit was because I was working overnights and my mental health declined. If I could get a job there during the day, I'd be happy."
PetSmart,1en7gmsicu3sj800,3.0,"Working here was fun and a good first job, but only managers get anywhere around full-time. Part-time workers are worked very little and do just about every duty in the store for only minimum wage. And managers are paid barely above minimum. Overall, it's just a place to get some experience before moving on to a better opportunity."
PetSmart,1en7fho4eu3sj800,1.0,"PetSmart is a great example of a big corporation that exploits their workers. Most stores hire people at just under the full time requirement so that they'll have you there every day but you do not get benefits. You are going to get minimum wage, and often times the store is so understaffed that you will be guilted into not taking your breaks. The most frustrating part about PetSmart is the way they are handling COVID. The sanitation rules are not enforced and if you get COVID, there is little to no help offered to you."
PetSmart,1en76j984u3sj800,2.0,Company used to be great to work for but over the past couple of years has really gone downhill. Corporate doesn't provide enough hours to properly run the store or take care of the animals. Ever since covid started I have not felt safe at my job because we are not allowed to enforce the mask mandate
PetSmart,1en6frsq3u3d8800,2.0,It is a great place to start to work however it is retail and all the company care about is sales. Customers were awful and dealing with them was horrendous.
PetSmart,1en4p4luqo22b800,4.0,"This was one of my favorite jobs I’ve worked, my coworkers and management were pretty cool and seeing animals everyday made it fun. Although you don’t get raises very often and there’s not much of advancement, you get an employee discount and they are flexible with schedules. Working here while going to school was great, they have a tuition reimbursement program & they pay you after a semester if you pass. The only thing that sucked was the crazy cat ladies that came in and complained about things you couldn’t change/do."
PetSmart,1en206v52u3sj800,4.0,Overworked. No hours. The store leadership is doing the roles of cashier and stocker. Used to love it. Now looking elsewhere.
PetSmart,1en1g1o7eu3d8800,2.0,"In the beginning I really enjoyed my time at this job. As I spent more time there, however, I began to see it for what it really is... a money-hungry corporation just looking to make the most cheese any way possible. Over the years our salon staff started to dwindle under constant lack of competent management. They were constantly hiring unqualified people for the job, failing to train them properly, and then would be surprised when we had terrible feedback from customers. After COVID hit it only got worse. They expected us to do our regular amount of work and then some to make up for the other salon members that had left for various reasons - all while hearing from store management that they couldn’t help us because they were just ‘too busy’ out on the floor. Nevermind that when we had a salon worker test positive for the virus, they did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in response. They didn’t close the salon, they didn’t sanitize overnight, nothing - nada, zero, zip, zilch. Every single person in the salon was so unhappy, yet none wanted to leave, mostly because of their benefits package which is about the only reason worth staying for this company."
PetSmart,1en1f7gl0u3sj800,2.0,"Days are long, constantly pulled away from the dog you're working on to answer phones or do a walk in nail trim. upper management pushes more dogs into your schedule so you're constantly behind. management does not help you stay on track."
PetSmart,1en12d5r5u3sj800,4.0,Flexible and beneficial great company to work for definitely recommend it as a first time job but don’t plan or expect to move up in the company with change due
PetSmart,1emvhsrigo22b800,4.0,"A someone who had no experience grooming or bathing dogs when i was hired, I learned a lot and enjoyed working with the animals everyday. There was room for growth to advance to a Groomer position, which was nice"
PetSmart,1emvh35bit51u800,2.0,I work with them for over a year. When I first came in they were all very sweet but within a month the management totally changed and went down hill from there. Management is what made me give this job such a low score. The job is VERY enjoying if you love animals and know how to handle. The management team picked favorites and broke a good few rules as well. basically turned into high school drama. They DID NOT CARE for the employees when they had personal problems and would talk badly behind your back. Very selfish and it got to a point where the head store manager didn’t fix anything that 2 managers in the hotel left due to unfairness and favoritism. I would not work here personally and would not recommend
PetSmart,1emvaihd6o1no800,3.0,A lot of turn over with people starting with higher pay doing less then you. It’s a job don’t plan on staying for a long period because you won’t make anything more but .20
PetSmart,1emtj14k0o1no800,2.0,"I got hired as an early morning stocker and was told I would work 4am-12pm most days and get out at 8am other days. During the short time I worked here, they had me on register 99% of the time even though I told them I don’t want to be a cashier and I was hired as a stocker. And then after I got back from vacation they drastically cut everyone’s hours. Mine was down to 5 hours a week. That’s when I said peace I’m out. It’s nice getting a paycheck weekly and the job isn’t high responsibility but management is very poor at this location and no one communicates with each other"
PetSmart,1emt26t6so15v800,4.0,"Fun job, good hours. I worked here in my early 20’s. I think it’s a great job for any one who needs to earn some money while still having a flexible schedule. Learned a lot about pet care."
PetSmart,1emrq60jds7fh800,3.0,PetSmart is one of the leaders in pet retail but it’s very fast oriented. Understated and you have to make the decision of sacrificing customer service for tasks that sometimes have no impact on the store.
PetSmart,1emqdnukvo15v800,2.0,"This store is an absolute train wreck. I worked there for a couple years and throughout the time I was there, my job role got bounced around, had a ton of turnover, bunch of new managers and more. Some managers were great, others were so incompetent it would have been laughable had I not been totally messed over all the time. I only worked the job I was hired as for like 6 months before they changed my job role with no notice, explanation or reason whatsoever. Store lead had no care or concern for availability of associates or when asked why job role was changed. Also, they do not care about the safety of the animals whatsoever. Sick animal? Shove it in quarantine until they eventually die. They rarely ever had actual vet visits and many animals could have survived had they seen a vet and weren't just shoved in the quarantine sick room. Tiny Tales cages are death traps and yet they promote them. So much wrong."
PetSmart,1emn8vddvu1m2800,3.0,"Typical retail job with wonky hours and low pay rate, but overall decent job to have. I don't have the patience to work retail long term... but it wasn't the worst place"

PetSmart,1emmjsp05ocqa800,3.0,"If you've worked any other retail job you have an idea what to expect. The only twist is the pet focused nature of the company, so you do have opportunities to mess with cute animals each day."
PetSmart,1emlu0rj2u1ac800,5.0,I had a good job there but I had to leave due to my hands getting an allergic reaction. All my coworkers were nice and I had the same customers every week so it was fun to see the same faces.
PetSmart,1emlh3g1mu1ac800,1.0,Leadership team seems to only believe one side of a story when someone reports another associate. They will not help an associate.
PetSmart,1emkdkm75u1ac800,3.0,Each Petsmart is either great or terrible depending on the management. At Petsmart in Peru when I worked there was pretty great! The store manager was very nice and willing to help me succeed and teach me. The pay at petsmart wasn't great as it is a corporate company.
PetSmart,1emfo7pvmu1m2800,1.0,"I was a pet stylist apprentice. The only training you receive is videos that are about a minute long. I’ve never trimmed a dogs nails before and the only training I got was a 30 second clip of someone trimming nails and it was the worse angle and not even zoomed in. They need more hands on training!! They show you everything in the videos, then you’re expected to just jump in and do it and be comfortable the first time though. Videos don’t account for squirmy dogs, aggressive dogs, or anything else that might happen. I wouldn’t let a hairstylist cut and style my hair if she only learned through videos, so why are we allowing people to bathe and groom dogs without hands on training and practice?!! Ever since I started I knew it wasn’t going to work. I was always scheduled 5 hour shifts and received no break because of it. The only people who got breaks were those who worked 6 or more hours which is why I was conveniently scheduled 5 5 hour shifts a week. I had to go to the bathroom to even get a sip of water. The pay is terrible. You only make decent money if you’re a groomer who’s always booked up. Don’t work in the salon unless you plan on waiting over a year to become a stylist and another year to actually get clients and make good money."
PetSmart,1emcgeqo7u2u5800,3.0,"Pay could be better, but overall it was a good place to get started in retail and customer service. Too much is expected from the pet care department for too little pay."
PetSmart,1emcdvqefs7e8800,2.0,"The company is great to work for to start grooming as long as you don’t mind a two year contract. You will be trained with the company to groom breed standards and safety. Long term- you are expected to work nights and almost every weekend (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.) The company is very pushy on up selling people and numbers (including how many grooms you do in a day) so if you’re numbers aren’t up to par, expect to be talked to or potentially written up. Overall when I started with the company it was great, they were bought out by another company since then which has been known to flip businesses into being more profitable. Expect to feel like a number in a corporation."
PetSmart,1emb3eq29u2u5800,3.0,"I was a dog trainer at petsmart, the only trainer in the store, and while I loved the training aspect of my job, I was treated as an associate that *sometimes* had training (I had A LOT of training stuff to do) and management would get upset when I was too busy to help them around the store. I could never be sick because I didn't have anyone to cover my classes so I would have to work while ill."
PetSmart,1emamr9iis7du800,2.0,I can go on and on about this company but won’t.
PetSmart,1emac99fcu1nm800,1.0,"A typical day at work was stressful. Working in Pet Care is pretty much you coming in and assuming nothing has been done. It was never a team effort working here, even though that was the only way to be successful. Management was trash. The managers would only respond if they HAD to be called on the radio, otherwise they would toss up who has to leave the office. The scheduling problem was a whole issue within itself, never was posted on time until one of the store managers got reported than they finally started making it weeks ahead. Any ""enjoyable"" part of the job was the animals when they weren't coming in with infections. You only get a 15% discount so it really isn't anything to write home about. From the managers not wanting to take a dying snake to the hospital to never making the schedule on time, this is a job I wouldn't reccommend to my worst enemy."
PetSmart,1em9jq67hu1nm800,5.0,"Great place to work!  Yes there are some annoying customers, but that is everywhere.  Managers tend to stay in place too long which prevents opportunities for advancement.  Pay opportunities are great as you move up."
PetSmart,1em7ftg9vs7e8800,2.0,"The company was wonderful to work for until it was bought by BC Partners. Once it went private, making a profit was all that mattered. Communication became unorganized, corporate people came and left the company constantly, and the family feeling disappeared. Manager pay was decent, associate pay not so much. And once Covid hit, things went downhill even more. The company was slow to respond to safety measures and laid off its cleaning people (at a time when sanitation was of the utmost importance), then came down on the stores about their cleanliness! The company also reduced associate hours w the expectation that the salaried store managers would make up the difference. They did not give hazard pay to anyone, but did take away the manager and associate annual increases to pay out a ""thank you"" bonus to associates (giving nothing to managers)."
PetSmart,1em5a0ed4u2u5800,3.0,Like many of the other reviews about PetSmart I also have seen a decline in the company over the years. I was with the company from the end of 2017 to the summer of 2020 but I've heard it started getting bad about 5+ years ago. Corporate doesn't care about the employees or animals. After covid hit they fired most of the staff and put all the work on a couple employees and managers. There were times where it'd be just me and a cashier for an 8+ hour shift. They cut more and more people but expect more work to be done. Trucks from weeks prior will still be in the back needing to be worked because we wouldn't have enough staff to run the store and fill. It also got to a point where morning petcare duties would be crammed into the night duties as well so they would only have to have one person come in for the day but that meant that sick animals would miss medications and of course not all the work could be done by one person in a shift while also dealing with customers/checkout/curbside/phones and whatever else. The company has surpassed sales goals for months during covid but refuse to hire employees back because they see how much more money they can make by having less staff. It was a weight off my shoulders to quit from this company.
PetSmart,1em1fspr5u2u5800,5.0,they started changing the schedule after covid where you are in petcare 8 to 1230 lunch is 1230 to 1 then you are cashier until you leave. absolutely caused alot of issues with the care and up keep of the animals. amazing team
PetSmart,1elt71sdks7du800,3.0,"Overworked, managers will lie to you to get what they want, and not every location takes great care of their animals. Some of them do, but it really depends. They say they want all of their employees that can be to be cross trained, but not all of them make time for it."
PetSmart,1elt2f4q8s7du800,4.0,"My job at PetSmart was a lot of fun. I really loved getting to interact with a lot of different dog breeds and people. My absolute favorite part was when we had puppies come in and I got to bathe and play with the puppies. Working in the salon is a lot of hard work though, especially as a bather. While you may be overbooked with a ton of dog breeds (some that take more than the usual 2 hour maximum allowed bath time, like malamutes or other large, thick-furred breeds) you still have to take every walk-in nails appointment or walk-in bath appointments. On weekends, it can be incredibly overwhelming, and there would be times I would be stressed to tears. It's also a really active job, so if you're not okay with a lot of moving around, bending over for long periods of time, and lifting heavy puppies, it might not be a good fit for you. The back was also really wet and cold so I got sick with a cold often. But having those clients that would come back to see you and getting to know each dog well, and have them excited to come back to see you, was a feeling I really couldn't replace. I would go home every night stinky and smelling like dog and covered in fur though. I loved my coworkers and we would all get along so great, joking and laughing and helping each other take care of dogs. I did appreciate how my salon manager worked with me and made sure I was okay and helped me whenever I needed help. She really made the job a lot less stressful. And as for moving up, you can either choose to stay a bather or go to Grooming School to become a groomer, so it's entirely up to you how you"
PetSmart,1elsoqvjks7e8800,1.0,There was always some drama going on through the work days. You couldn’t call out sick at all unless you wanted to have the managers act funny towards you for weeks after. And the management also doesn’t help as much as you’d expect them to they just sit in there office all day.
PetSmart,1elrsu491s7du800,3.0,"Low pay for management position, many OSHA violations, lack of training, outdated systems, but the store employee culture was nice. Meeting people's pets makes it a different kind of customer service job."
PetSmart,1elr1u4oho259800,4.0,"Was a great place to work, wish i didn't work so far so i could continue working there. Management was very good in regards to worklife/balance"
PetSmart,1elr0iem6u1nm800,5.0,Petsmart is a great place to work the employees their are always helpful if you can't do a dog by yourself they are more than willing to help you. They try everything in their power to get the dog done. Meetings are about what everyone could do better not just what we are doing wrong. They love focusing on the things we are doing correctly.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1elqobj7tu2u5800,3.0,"It felt really good helping the animals quality of life, and helping the pet parents improve the quality of their pets' lives as well. I learned a lot of new things, and met some really nice people, and it felt good being needed, since I was the only cross trained employee at the time of my employment, so I would work a shift being a cashier, and then work a shift doing pet care, a lot of the time in the same shift, or back to back"
PetSmart,1eloqa3lvnpcn800,3.0,"Production often fluctuates and they sometimes require your to work longer than the times you were orginially scheduled for. I appreciate they feel bad, but it is a lot for some people to work almost 50-60 hours a week when you signed up for 40."

PetSmart,1eleishrqu1cn800,2.0,"You meet some great people, but they suck at hiring management, if you get hurt or need emergency assistance the response time is awful. You can work yourself to the bone (even skipping lunches and bathroom breaks) just to be told you are still not doing enough. Corporate barely knows what is going on at the stores they are over. You can work somewhere much less stressful for much more pay."
PetSmart,1elb2jvf8s7l9800,2.0,"havent worked here in a while but when i did management sucked, it probably still does. Mostly young kids work here. Dont really care about doing the job, just want to play with animals and talk to their friends. Floor associates are mostly part time, so its not a job for you if you need a steady income."
PetSmart,1elau3q7is7ic800,5.0,The dogs are the best part of working at petsmart. I enjoy coming to work and having one on one time with my favorite animals. I like that we aren't allowed to take aggressive pets. It makes work a lot easier.

PetSmart,1el6dqc7gs7l9800,3.0,Petsmart is a good place to work especially for work experience! I definitely think management could use improvement though. I have very nice coworkers but we are very understaffed... Management doesn't take enough responsibility we always only close with one manager and most times there won't be a manager on the floor to help you when you need or they take very long to come.
PetSmart,1el48lgcvu2f5800,3.0,"Back in the day petsmart was the best place to shop for pets. Since the buy out in 2014/15 the company is going down hill. The associates don't CARE i walk in and I feel like about to get a burrito at moes "" welcome to petsmart!!!!"" But they don't stop and ask you anything."
PetSmart,1el3f2bdhu1qi800,2.0,"The store lead isn't very capable, and the salon is an extremely stressful, toxic place to work. The groomers are so catty and treat the bathers terribly with no consequences from the salon manager. They don't pay you enough to tolerate being treated that way."
PetSmart,1el1djfd0u2f5800,5.0,"One of the best jobs I had, management was awesome and upbeat great at keeping you motivated. Honestly zero complaints, would definitely work here again. They truly care about you and that's hard to find in a job anymore. The best part was being able to interact with the customers and animals on a daily basis."
PetSmart,1el142ecgo1eg800,2.0,"Communication is key. Management wasn’t always the most helpful and the salon seemed to form cliques, but there were some cool people to talk to. Just never out side of work"
PetSmart,1el12a8lku2f5800,3.0,"Worked as stocker, had to come in at 4. Work was fine, but hours were not great. It is a good part time job for someone in high school or college that needs some quick cash, but can't live off of it."
PetSmart,1ekvgvf27u2f5800,1.0,It was terrible to work for. The manger was rude and the other employees would bully me or be rude towards me for no reason. I refuse to ever go there again. They made me feel so low.

PetSmart,1ekrvgtednph9800,1.0,Management in salon was horrible. Started with no lead so sent to another store to train with awesome people and leads. Then sent back to store I was to work at which was in Stroudsburg PA. Finally got salon lead who just graduated grooming school come in on a power trip to everyone. When I would ask for help didn't receive it as I was still learning. It got so stressful I did quit. Not to mention how dirty the salon was no one kept up cleaning it all fell on new girl. I started with another girl but she never showed back up. I wonder why till I seen it happening to myself. I was told I'd receive breaks most of them were missed because of work load and no help.
PetSmart,1ekrks7g5u2f5800,5.0,"I loved the management team, got to know the returning customers and their pets.  Petsmart is a great place to work and a great place to move up.  Overall petsmart by far was one of my favorite retail jobs I have ever had!"

PetSmart,1eknpigmksabu800,5.0,"I worked here for 5 years, started out as a cashier and worked my way up to Support Manager. Only took about a year and a half. The pay wasn’t so good but I started working there my senior year in high school so they knew they could cheat me in that area."
PetSmart,1ekko594qu1t7800,1.0,Watch out.  It may seem like a dream job but you are constantly having to worry about following policy instead of doing what is right/needed for the health and safety of pets.

PetSmart,1ekk0gi4vsa2d800,3.0,"It's gone down hill lately, but it's not all bad. The pay is good, the work is hard. Every store is short staffed. You are a number to the company and easily replaced, but lots of chances to move up."
PetSmart,1ekiph4sju1pi800,3.0,"I enjoyed working with animals, learning more about them, and talking about them with other people, but this was overall quite the stressful job. It did involve caring for the animals in the store, but also retail/sales tasks and customer service along with the extensive animal care and cleaning. I often felt very rushed and that I did not have enough time to complete everything that I needed to (before the store opened in the mornings especially). Customers can be extremely rude/mean and can wear you down mentally at times, like any retail job. I was a college student when I worked here, and my managers were always accommodating with my class schedule. Some of the other employees were difficult to work with at times (drama, complaining, gossip, etc.)."
PetSmart,1eki76qlau1t7800,4.0,"Set boundaries for yourself, don't let there be grey area in terms of what you're comfortable doing cause you will end up doing it. Days become pretty routine depending on what you are doing."

PetSmart,1ekhnmnmmnpmq800,2.0,"I have worked at multiple petsmarts and really it all comes down to your managers and coworkers on if you like this job. Because let me tell you, the customers and corporate are horrible. You WILL get many customers who want animals and not give them a good home, if you have a good manager you can say no but a bad manager may be a different story. But a big thing is that Petsmart does NOT care about you outside of work. I was often called in on my days off and guilt tripped if I could not come in and heaven help you if you try to call in sick even with this pandemic going on. I was chewed out horribly for calling in sick several times and once even told I HAD to come in even though I was very ill. To them, you are a work machine who needs to be there for them at any given time."
PetSmart,1ekhki1bnnpmq800,5.0,If you love animals more than humans like I do then this job is perfect for you! My favorite part of working here is getting to see and love on dogs that come in during my shifts..
PetSmart,1ekhhicjgnpmq800,5.0,Petsmart is a great place to work . Career advancement is very easy as long as you put the effort . They truly care about their employees . I started as a Bather and six months later i was sent to grooming school my store director lorena was awesome and taught us all so much she really loves what she does and it shoes with the quality of the store and happiness of pets and pet parents overall the company deserves a 10+ i learned so much from all my leaders .
PetSmart,1ekf3b99h308m000,5.0,Love the Pet parents love the ethos and everything that the Company has done for myself in my time with the company. Appreciate the COVID-19 protocols as well. Taken very seriously
PetSmart,1ekf1su913oh3000,1.0,"Pre covid, I was mostly happy working at Petsmart. There were challenges, but overall we were staffed well. I understand every company is having a hard time coping with covid, but our hours were cut to the point we're unable to give proper care to the animals in our store. I'm basically forced to lie to managment about what I'm doing (ex. saying I'm helping a costumer) to just be able to feed and water all my animals every night. There's little to no concern on a corporate level for the animal's safety or health - they're only treated like merchandise. Animald are dying from subpar care, employees are consistently working off the clock to keep the store afloat, and the hours aren't being brought back even as our revenue has returned to pre covid levels. Oh, we did get a $100 bonus taxed at 50% and a ""thank you"" pin to wear, so all our costumers know we've been thanked for being essential. Super validating considering theres no cleaning protocol anymore. Pin pads, carts, even bathrooms don't yet cleaned even on a weekly basis now."
PetSmart,1ekeqgdt6u4av800,1.0,"Don’t work here. The management is terrible because they expect you to consistently bust your a*s, and make over 100% and when you take a break to breathe or go to the bathroom they hound you for it. Rate was really hard to acquire and when you did make rate they expected more out of you. They say that when you make rate and work for 3 months that you get cross trained in another region, not true. I was there for almost a year and they kept me in the same region, but we’re hiring people straight into the region I wanted to be trained in. Can’t forget to mention that since covid, they’ve mandated every weekend to work for the past 5 or 6 months, and are now forcing people to work 60 hours a week. Their application is all a lie and they are liars because they never once stood behind anything they promised. When I first started working there I had intentions to build a career because I thought it was a great job, but there’s a lot they don’t tell you till your actually there and they treat their employees like slaves, ontop of firing you if you make one mistake. Their turnaround rate is unbelievable, 5 or 6 new people being trained every week. DONT WORK HERE."

My only complaint is I wish you were paid commission per dog instead of hourly."

PetSmart,1ek5ia9003o71000,2.0,"Although I loved working at Petsmart, I was underpaid and under appreciated. Nice to your face and then mistreat you with their actions. Being a sales associate means being bored most of your shift if you aren’t given tasks or have customers coming in."
PetSmart,1ek50m8seu1jh800,1.0,Fun but unorganized place to work. They do not put employees first. They do not help with growth and development and the management is not engaged with the employees.

PetSmart,1ek25uuqeo2dd800,1.0,"I was so excited to work at PetSmart, and from day one, I felt unwelcome. It was confusing to be hired for my skills and experience, only to be treated like an idiot constantly by my manager. There was a group in our department that included a lot of leadership who had been friends for years, and they all just raved about each other's work and ignored anyone not in the in group."
PetSmart,1ek1g6smsu3cj800,1.0,"A long time ago this company was really good but alot has changed. Really depends on store leader some are good,  mine only cares about their ego and their standing and not about their employees. Working there leaves you with a case of PTSD."
PetSmart,1ek0dg9qqsa4h800,1.0,"By far one of the worst places I’ve ever worked. They promise you training as a groomer after two years but they will delay it if they don’t have someone competent in your position. Black mold was growing in the bathing room but management refused to acknowledge it and just pained over it. The paint used took 24 hrs to dry but management refused to allow it to cure, saying the salon couldn’t be closed even a day, and dogs went home shaved because we couldn’t get the paint off them. Banfield attached  to us didn’t care about the welfare of animals in our care, allowing pets to suffer so they could close early or so that they didn’t have to deal with it. I’d only accept a position here is you don’t care about animals and are okay with apathetic management."
PetSmart,1ek0bqa6gs7ds800,2.0,"This location lacks the fair treatment to it's employees. The pay is poor and managers are expected to complete more job assignments than they were originally assigned at the time of hire. Hours change sporadically and with very short notice, or none at all. Certain coworkers are favorited. Overall a very disappointing workplace."
PetSmart,1ejvqfeov3o71000,1.0,"Working at petsmart was by far the worst experience of my life. The management would purposefully get in the way of you doing your job and then berate you for doing poorly. Coworkers refused to care for animals correctly: over a dozen animals died in the time I worked there from being improperly medicated or straight up dehydrated to death. Those were just the ones I found myself. Company requires employees to feed an incorrect diet to animals to save costs, to the point of causing medical issues due to lack of nutrients."
PetSmart,1ejuc6v0bu1ej800,3.0,"Started off as a seasonal cashier and I absolutely hated it. I never have experienced worse anxiety in my life than on the register. After months and months and almost a year working there, I was finally moved departments (pet care). I was much happier. Although I do not agree with most of the protocol and animal care rules that we had to abide by, working with animals was fun and my team and coworkers were great."
PetSmart,1ejt3n8p9npt5800,5.0,I was in the Petcare department and occasionally on register. I loved being in petcare. Lots of flexibility in hours and your focus doesnt always have to be on customer service but instead on animal care and safety.
PetSmart,1ejqpa2ouu2v7800,5.0,"I worked here all through getting my bachelors degree and they were always very understanding about my changing schedules. Everyone was lovely to work with and the environment is great. Only thing is it is a retail job, so dealing with bad customers can be a downside."
PetSmart,1ejp6c809u2v7800,3.0,"Working with the animals is fun and a big stress reliever if you work at a slower store. When you are hired, you are not given much information on how to care for animals, but are taught how corporate wants you to care for the animals when they are in the store (which is not good for long term). Unfortunately at all locations many customers get defensive if you try to educate them on what the proper animal care for each animal is. If you work in the petcare department as an opener, the main tasks are cleaning animal enclosures, which is great if you enjoy cleaning. Petcare closers clean a bit, check on the animals, and do anything else that needs catching up on. If you work as a cashier, get ready to put on a smile and be tethered to the register for most of your shift while also being expected to stock, grab carts, check online orders, greet everyone, etc. Email capture and having customers enrolled for the rewards system is a big deal, and so is selling a certain amount of puppy guides every week. Of course, some locations are not as pushy about it as others. I do not recommend working at a petsmart that is large and busy on the weekends, as all of that traffic will be on you, the one cashier, and the single manager that got scheduled for that day. Many (if not all) stores are not given enough hours to schedule employees so that all customers can be helped in a timely manner, so many times it's just you and two other employees."
PetSmart,1ejo8jd4uu1l6800,4.0,It is always something new every day that I like or don't like. it would be hard to get the time off that I need to take off. My bosses were nice but they didn't ever hire enough people so we would be working full time as I am a part time employee while in school.
PetSmart,1ejlresf5npdo800,2.0,"Below average management, last minute scheduling, did not take covid seriously, managers are rude, they also leave the cashiers with bling lines while gossiping in the cash room. Lack of training, they kinda just throw you out there and get annoyed when you ask questions. Their animals they’d eat basically come from the equivalent of puppy mills, most die upon arrival, they’re also unethical with how they keep the pets and they info they give out"
PetSmart,1ejlb88mgu1l6800,1.0,Your not paid well to start. The managers do not care about you and you are expected to know/do more than whats required of your actual job.

I was a Support Manager for several years.

Theres definitely 'Classes' in which you can't be friends with anyone above you in which I was literally told ""You can only hang out with people on your level."" Also favoritism is very obviously ruled in when it comes to promitions. Managers can talk down to you and are kinda mean. They could probably bully and call you names and upper managers still use excuses about them being stressed. Also be prepared to take on some of the extra Managers work that their probably gonna put on you and make the excuse that their busy. I've never felt more disposable then I do here.

PetSmart,1eir5mjjmsqbl800,4.0,Depending on which store you work at can depend on your management attentiveness. Some managers are super supportive others aren't. The compensation and pay could be higher but it is retail so I didn't expect it to be 15/hr. I really love the culture at PetSmart. I worked there for 5 years total as a cashier. Now am interviewing for the trainer position. The only reason I got the trainer interview was because a store desperately needed one. Other wise there really is no room for advancement of your store leader doesn't like you.
PetSmart,1eipk9d5cof3u800,3.0,"I loved working at PetSmart on the days everything went smoothly.  It was easy to become overworked given a lack of support staff, but I loved my coworkers and I loved a lot of my customers, and really, what more can you want from a retail job?"
PetSmart,1eipe2hmru1dj800,2.0,Dog trainers here are basically treated as cashiers but with twice the workload and no time to do it on a register. When you’re hired you’re told you will spend some time on the register but the reality is it will be 90% of your job.
PetSmart,1einjlmjgolck800,4.0,"Working with dogs is rewarding, informative, and often fun. However, I feel that my Salon Manager was not very interested in guiding me with my first few dogs. She kind of just left me to my own devices, and when I'd ask for advice when uncertain about something, she seemed irritated. Luckily, the more experienced bather was incredibly kind and was more than happy to assist, which ultimately allowed me to learn and perform better on future clients."
PetSmart,1eimeeumtu1dj800,4.0,"Great place to work, you learn so much about the animals. Customers are the best/worst part of the job. It's very gratifying when the customer appreciates the extra work you put in, but it's frustrating when some customers clearly don't care about their animals."
PetSmart,1eilvium1u1dj800,5.0,"Working in the grooming salon is a lot of fun. My coworkers are nice, genuine people, and management seems to truly care about the employees. You get the sense that corporate always wants to push us to do more and more, though: booking more dogs, answering more calls, making more money. This can become stressful and overwhelm the salon."
PetSmart,1eil6nuodof3u800,3.0,Pets were welcome where I worked so that made it a better atmosphere.  The managers were not that good- they often had too much to do with too few people.
PetSmart,1eikggmaoree1800,1.0,"There is very little training, especially for a job that requires extensive knowledge about animals and their overall health/well-being. It helps to do your OWN research about the different animals they carry, as the information they give you about them is 1) insufficient 2) not very specific and 3) completly incorrect. If you come into this job expecting to be taught a lot about the little creatures in our care, you’ll be in for an unpleasant surprise. PetSmart doesn’t teach you squat about what our company is supposed to care about most, the animals. Our store was also severely understaffed, so we had to cut corners when it came to cleaning habitats, administering treatment to sick animals, and other basic care duties."
PetSmart,1eik7obv3ree1800,1.0,A very happy clean work enviroment. Gives you a sense of purpose and meaning. Nice to see the animals and people together. Itvis a very non toxic work wnviroment.
PetSmart,1eiffj8kru1dj800,2.0,"Certain employees were able to get a set schedule others weren’t certain employees we’re not. The pay is not enough and I wouldn’t consider it a safe environment a lot of things break or we’re understaffed not very clean. They did not do much for social distancing and putting up pixie glass until after two months of re-opening. They sent staff home if it is too slow so they cut your hours, Or if it was too busy you weren’t able to get an actual break"
PetSmart,1eifcggnnolck800,3.0,"I worked for this company for 8 years and majority of the employees at the store level are hard workers who truly care about staff and animals. Its the field/corporate/upper management who only see dollars and expect you to offer top notch animal care as well as excellent customer service on bare bones budget. Vet care is always encouraged when needed, but it is truly the bare minimum given. Same with employees. There is very little reward for going above and beyond in the workplace. 99% of overtime hours are expected to be worked for free without thanks."
PetSmart,1eiepie6eu1dj800,1.0,"You would think working at petstore would be awesome, but it was the worst place to work. Corporate has no clue what people need or want, management doesn't support its employees. You shouldn't be stressed to go to work worrying how much mental abuse is going to take place. Hardly any hours for part timers and the pay is terrible."

PetSmart,1eicctbglu1dj800,3.0,Pay & benefits
PetSmart,1eicahqdoocr4800,1.0,"In the time I worked there I came to realize you are just a slave for a lazy manager. Corporate doesn't care about you, or how many times you cover shifts, or the fact that you are there during a pandemic. They won't pay you extra for working in an inviroment where it is very possible you could contract covid. In particular they won't care if you do your job right or wrong, because all management cares about is getting to go home early and not interacting with customers. Good luck getting help or anything for that matter from this company because you will die an early death from stress and no one there will care."
PetSmart,1eibi7bidsqbl800,1.0,"I've worked at two locations for Petsmart. Southlake is awful. In the beginning, it was fantastic. The assistant hotel manager is very immature and childish and will run to the store manager if she has a problem with you in an attempt to get you into trouble. Micromanaging is also a huge issue. The hotel manager was pretty cool. She was very flexible with scheduling. If you ever want to move up into a higher position, forget about it. They have this idea that bringing in outside people will ""help"" and throw away those of us that have years of experience away like trash. Some people will change the camp rotation consistently throughout the day and put you into the same camp room for hours, usually with ""problematic "" dogs that they don't want to deal with and if you have children you need to pick up from school, good luck. They'll leave you in said camp room and avoid relieving you with no care of your after work obligations. If you overnight, expect to be left with 80+ dogs by yourself during holidays and you WILL get complaints on why all of the dogs aren't walked. Also, no 15 minute breaks."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1eiaotb1mof3u800,2.0,"Working for Petsmart has been an eye opening experience for me. The management is poor, as well as the company. Part time employees rarely get acknowledged or receive benefits. Other than that, making relationships with costumers and working with animals is the only plus."
PetSmart,1eia7nin6sqbl800,3.0,"Ever since hours were cut, it made doing the job difficult as we open up to take care of the animals the same time the store opens, which means associates don’t have enough time to do the tasks required. Seeing all sorts of animals coming in the store is interesting, but you also get a fair share of people who have no idea how to care for the animals"
PetSmart,1eia1hjqjsqbl800,2.0,The management does not listen they could care less about what is going on good or bad. They only care about if it will effect them or not. Cant help when needed because they don't know how to do the tasks that your asking for help for so i don't see them qualified to be management. They cant see when there is a certain person causing the problem and cant be the strong voice the store needs.
PetSmart,1ei9u7kb9u1dj800,5.0,"I worked here as a seasonal employee. The management team were all super friendly, and the training was very easy to learn and get the hang of! The overall nature this job gave me was very caring and considerate, and their goals of making pets happy and healthy was very clear the moment I walked in! Everyone also accepted my disability limits and management would let me have a small breather if things got a bit hectic for me to handle. If I could give this company more than five stars, I would!"
PetSmart,1ei7p2n99of3u800,2.0,"The work itself can be both difficult or easy it really depends on how well you adapt to the needs of the pet your caring for. Some can be very difficult and others easy, the pets parents can also be difficult or not knowledgeable of the best needs for their dog and it is up to educate them. They don't like that their pet behaves a certain way for grooming but that's just how it is and they can be rude. The most difficult aspect of the job is corporates view on grooming. It is very much a numbers game for them and you are a cog in the machine, a number, and a graph. You may be forced to be over productive to the point of burn-out, anxiety, and frustration/depression. Some dogs may need more time but that doesn't always matter to them. I rarely if ever take a lunch break, how can I when there's to much to do. The best people you'll deal with will probably be your fellow groomers or customers who appreciate what you do."
PetSmart,1ei4n6h36rfvu800,2.0,"Never was able to to do the job I was actually hired for and wanted in the first place. Never had a good consistent schedule. Was always volunteered to cover other people's shift, managers don't really know how to teach people and get frustrated when you don't know something. Was left alone to open the store on my second day and had customers get mad at me because i had no idea what to do. Pretty low pay scale."
PetSmart,1ei4f1ce3ro7r800,3.0,"Decent job. The only part I really didn't like was the pay and working the early morning hours (3am-4am start time). Mangement, when I worked there, was decent."
PetSmart,1ei4ecqqtr6jn800,2.0,"I have worked for this company for 4 years as a Cashier. They have offered me no possibility for promotion, as well as just generally being nasty towards I and other employees. I make 15¢ above minimum wage with now 4 years of retail experience, and every year I lose my small raise due to minimum wage increasing. The customers that come into our stores are amazing, and I enjoy seeing our regulars and their pets, and they all know me by name, but that's about all that's enjoyable now."
PetSmart,1ei24pnk2rfvu800,3.0,"Had flexible scheduling and good management. Work day is basically answering phone calls, scheduling appointments, bathing dog/clipping nails/brushing out."
PetSmart,1ei192idvr6jn800,4.0,"I enjoy my time at PetSmart, everyday is different and nothing is the same. The pets make your day enjoyable. Your employees are fun and the upper management is your basic upper management so it is what it is. But working at PetSmart has been great."

PetSmart,1ehqt60rer53c800,3.0,"This company is making things up as it goes. When I first started, I thought the priority here was the well-being of it animals but all the business is looking to do is roll a profit.

PetSmart,1ehpdb24qr53c800,4.0,I loved working there.  The work was great and so were the hours. The only thing that could of made it better is if the had more people working there so one group of people didn’t have to work so hard but other then that it was a ok company to work for
PetSmart,1ehnh5p7dr72v800,2.0,"I worked here for 3 years and my husband for 5 years. They as a company got rid of all but 4 full time positions that weren’t manager positions. My store specifically had a very rude and sexist store manager, he treated all the girls like they were ditzy and incompetent, and for most he refused to let them do anything but work the register or sort shelves. Luckily I started after my husband with a large knowledge of the pets so I got to work pet care, that was the best part of the job. We took care of the animals and fish and reptiles, we also took care of the shelter cats when the volunteers needed us to. I was lucky enough to have a very smart team around me to teach me so much about animals. The most fun I ever had at work was getting to help families pick out everything they needed for the new pet I helped them learn about!"
PetSmart,1ehjbdum3r4qu800,3.0,"As a pet hotel employee, I mostly did physical work. Don’t think you’re just gonna be standing in a room with dogs playing all day. You’re going to be seeing a lot of nasty dog fluids and excrement. And you’re going to be cleaning it up! From baths to laundry to the dreaded morning and evening walks, you’re going to be moving a fair amount if your not doing doggy day camp. And doggy day camp isn’t fantastic either. Half the time you’re just standing on achey feet, the other your cleaning doo doo and having to break up fights. Management was fine, I liked my boss, but unfortunately she had to quit when the store refused to move up her position after 5 years at the hotel. Be aware petsmart is still a big, nasty corporation with absolutely no care about you or the animals, not really. And you’re going to see some really gross and questionable stuff."
PetSmart,1ehikam2nrapg800,4.0,I worked at Petsmart as a cashier. I started straight out of high school. They were flexible with my schedule for college. Management was fair. The dogs coming in to the store was my favorite part. Easy to become a lead and then move into management.

PetSmart,1ehiiq25er5q5800,4.0,"As a cashier a typical day was centered on checking customers out quickly. If the shift was slow, I could help stock the shelves in front of the cash register. Sometimes when other sections at the store were busy (ex. petcare) they would send me over to help catch fish or crickets for customers."
PetSmart,1ehgofjbhr4qu800,2.0,"Boring on slownights, truely infuriating on busy nights. The ""seniors"" do little to nothing to help PCS's when preparing the hotel for cleaning, and instead will sit up front and talk to eachother while everyone paid less then them run around with their heads cut off trying to get things done. Higher management never manages the lower management, which has lead them to become lazy, jaded and unsympethetic. If everyone did their job during the day, the Overnight position wouldn't be as exhausting as it is, but as it is now, duties tend to get shirked off to each new shift until it lands on the overnight shift who doesn't get that luxury. Theres also this bizarre feeling of being the ""lowest class"" as compared to everyone else, as you are often either forgotten or blamed for anything that goes wrong."

Orderfill is easy to make numbers. Anything with the  receiving side is a little tougher. The policies are made up on the fly. What is ok to do one week, may not be ok the next. There is no book or guide to refer to. The managers don't know half the time either what is ok to do policy wise. At the current time, there is no work life balance. We work 60 hours a week because of ""scheduled"" overtime. It got changed from mandatory during the pandemic so they didn't look like horrible. The people in that building are a mixed bag. You have your good one and your bad ones, like any warehouse. Everytime a change is made, it is usually to benefit the company, not the employee, which in turn had killed morale."

PetSmart,1eg8nc47ns4v4800,2.0,It can be fun working with dogs but you will constantly be yelled at by customers and then told by your manager that it’s “just how the job is”. Customers will treat you like dirt then get free stuff because of the tantrums they throw.
PetSmart,1eg8n9iqvs4v4800,2.0,"In my 2 years in the company I worked in 2 locations and my experiences was very different in one location I loved working there minus the costumers. In my 2nd location the floor coworkers was amazing!!! But, as for managers I was deeply dissatisfied I was told I don’t know anything for I was just a cashier (while trained as a bather and petcare and in vet school yeah I know nothing) it was all about the sale and the managers don’t want to do much work at all and will call you lazy that you don’t want to do anything and how bad you are at your job while sitting in the office on the phone. The pets I encountered are AMAZING but most costumers don’t want to take your advice so don’t be offended just give your opinion and leave it at that. Pay is 100% not worth working in 3 departments. Be prepared to work the same shift if you work one closing shift you pretty much work them all, same with opening and management won’t let you live down what they have done for you being a raise, full time hours or getting a day off. They are pretty good about giving it but let it be low staffed they won’t hesitate to have you work 7 days that week. Some managers don’t take sides they just talk to you about costumer complaints while others do, but there are favorable employees by store leader 100%."

They require tons of paperwork to be completed, daily inventory logs, the safety walks on the iPad have to take at least 10 minutes long. I spend so much time doing ""busy work"" that I can't l actually work. A good portion of my day now is spent picking online orders, answer the never ending phone and then running order after order outside to people. After the pandemic, I was enormously disappointed with the way the company responded. It took us about 6 weeks to get gloves, masks, dividers etc and yet we were busier than EVER. They cut payroll so that we were a skeleton crew but with an extremely busy store. My team couldn't even take proper breaks. It became downright unsafe due to the lack of staffing and then shoplifters began running rampant because there was no one to keep an eye on them. I'm happy Petsmart stepped up and gave all associates a sizeable bonus because my team absolutely deserves it, but I was shocked that managers got nothing at all. I close 4 nights a week and there is no work life balance. If you enjoy cleaning up dog mess all day and lifting very heavy dog food and cat litter this is the job for you."

Front desk would not provide back up when needed. Staff was undertrained. They would not clean walls of kennels or the gutters when cleaning the rooms. Playrooms would be filled beyond capacity with red tagged dogs or/and dogs with past documented aggression. Which lead to dogs getting hurt and two deaths, over three years. Front desk and management did not care. They are more concerned about making money then the health and safety of employees and pets."

PetSmart,1eg1pbibp3djs000,5.0,Hard worker... Took care of all the pets and made relationships with the pet parents. Hours were good pay was decent but all in all it was an amazing experience.
PetSmart,1eg186bu03djs000,5.0,Loads of associate support and resources. Team members are encouraged to cross train departments. A team member always has the potential to develop management skills and advancement.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1efvif9tebfgm800,1.0,"this is a bad place to work. They are not good about training new people. You get about 2 days and then get thrown in the deep end. You have to be ON TOP of your breaks, or you will not get them. The management has no idea what they're doing. We get no compensation for working during covid-19, and a lot of us got laid back with little warning, and then they cut contact. We're not treated very well."
PetSmart,1efupqjgibfgm800,5.0,Job was fun and kept me busy all day. I learned that it's best to work smart and efficiently than trying to get things done quickly. Managers and employees were kind and helpful. Enjoyed working for this company very much. Hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and seeing their pets that they brought along with them.
PetSmart,1efuoigipr572801,1.0,"I got the job as part time to save up for a car. It’s a good way to make some $ and it’s an easy job, especially if you are knowledgeable about pets. BUT management at my PetSmart specifically was absolutely awful. There’s 6 different managers and each one has their own way of doing things which is completely unorganized. They’d all tell me something different and you could never get a straight answer about anything! They’d also tell me to skip my 15 minute breaks all the time cause “they didn’t have anyone to take my place”. I literally got one 15 minute break when I was new and anytime after that they said I couldn’t go."
PetSmart,1efubccu6ol7u800,4.0,This was one of my favorite jobs. Unfortunately it is for kids and young adults to work. They way underpay and way overwork for the amount of pay. I met people that I had and have strong relationships with. I had never hung out with a manager before. I’ve never had a manager that was nice though until here. I love the customers(usually) and I love the animals I got to see ever day.
PetSmart,1efshb30dol7u800,1.0,"Be ready to give your life away to a company that just takes control of your life, This company will work you like a slave. You sign up for a shift and they make you work more than what your shift. For example I work 3rd shift. And out of the blue they have me work two extra days. So I'm working 3 12 HR shifts plus two days after that, Just because it's Mandatory, Also these people don't care about your well being weather it be Mental or Physical, They Just care about the almighty Dollar. I can go on all day about how bad they are. But if want to work here prepare to be miserable."
PetSmart,1efruv1dg38g4000,1.0,"I absolutely hate my job. I’m a cashier and it’s the worst position in the store. It truly is. The turn over rate for that position is ridiculous. I’ve made it known to management I want to switch to pet care and I’ve been ignored so that’s cool. Also for COVID no one got hazard pay or a bonus. My yearly review came up and I got a whopping $0.15 as my raise. Yep, im done. Finding a new job as of right now."
PetSmart,1efnhm4ng38g4000,5.0,"They are an amazing company to work for with great benefits and great work ethic, a lot of space and options for moving up within the company and gave lots of hands on training the employees were all wonderful and nice aswell"
PetSmart,1efn3n7a5r572800,5.0,Good company values that help make it a rewarding job. Most employees genuinely care about pets and helping pet parents give them the best life possible.
PetSmart,1efl48medol7u800,3.0,hours are cut everyday. You are lucky if you get 20 hours a week. No full time employees allowed to be hired. Good beginner Job. Not good for families. Pay sucks. You only get a percentage raise every year and thats maybe 10 cent
PetSmart,1efk1hch1r572800,3.0,management will tell you whatever you want to hear regarding schedules and job opportunities but there is no follow through or trust.  Management is extremely disorganized so everything from onboarding to training takes forever.  No respect paid to availability.
PetSmart,1efhubhgsq316800,5.0,This is a good place to work. Staff is very friendly and fair. I do wish that the pay was a bit higher but its not a big deal. Would recommend working here
PetSmart,1efhl3q34p0gt800,3.0,Very hard work and hard on the body. The labor required is not conductive to the time they give you to complete an order. You mainly have to over exert yourself to make production rate each week. And even then you still may not get it. And your highly pressured to do so. Pay is great but not to the equal amount of hussel you have to do to make production rate. Actually not even the pay is worth the slaving you endure. Company has a high turnover rate for years now.
PetSmart,1efgi522kofei800,1.0,To many rotten eggs ruining for those of us who work hard. The communication is poor when trying to do the right thing. I was a victim of retaliation for speaking up and no one helped me even though its a serious violation.
PetSmart,1efe984gnrcsq800,3.0,"Good management is a bit of a gamble, depending on location; But I guess that's any job. My coworkers are great, that's the primary reason I've stayed. The COVID situation really exposed company values and how much (or how little, rather) corporate values its employees. Our location is BUSY and shifts are usually constant run & go and often understaffed/underscheduled. So before you apply, I'd consider looking up some rough foot traffic stats on the location you're considering. Register is easy. Stocking is simple, but requires some degree of urgency and organization. Pet care is a LOT of customer service & educating pet parents. A lot of rushing around and trying to keep up with everything. BUT, if you're looking for some new knowledge, you will learn a ton."
PetSmart,1efdgsdtsoe9o800,2.0,"Loved working with customers dogs, absolutely a dream. Under paid for very strenuous/dangerous work. The salon leader at my location would beat dogs, choke dogs, and become overall aggressive towards pets that weren’t 100% compliant. Multiple times she would trim dogs nails so short they would bleed for upward of 30 minutes and she would never seek vet attention. And the store leader and salon leader were friends so she ignores anything you bring up to her. Got bullied by the salon leader until I ended up quitting, crying to the store manager was pointless. Then all the other long term employees in the salon quit too due to the horrendous management."
PetSmart,1efda2a1eoe9o800,4.0,"Grooming the dogs is fun, but big decisions for the salon are made by the district people who have zero experience grooming. Pay is based on commission, potential to make a lot of money or none at all. Pressure from higher ups to groom more dogs, sometimes more than your physically able to. Can be highly stressful, but the super cute dogs that come in make it worth it. Helps open your eyes to the different types of neglect people can have towards their animals, mostly cast matted dogs that come to get shaved down once a year. Satisfaction for dematting those dogs, knowing for a short period they will be comfortable. Having worked for two different stores, the management is always randomized. First manager was always against us and it was always us vs the manager & the pet parents. Current manager defends us and learns both sides of the story."
PetSmart,1efab26japbqj800,3.0,"You can have a great team, but that doesn't stop the overwhelming amount of things happening all at the same time from corporate ideas coming into store unplanned. They don't look at demographics so a store with a lower income area needs more staff but they will not give labor and don't understand why they cant achieve the same as areas in higher demographic areas. The amount of people you have working or labor available to work affects safety within the team and therefore some stores must be unsafe to succeed. The only person who is salary is the store leader so unless that one person is willing to work with no balance the store doesn't achieve success as measured by the company. Which is not based on sales so even if your doing well from a sales standpoint other factors are seen as a failure but if your sales slip your also seen as a failure so there isn't a great game plan. I understand its a giant company but lets make it more comprehensive and easy to train associate seeing as no one really gets trained to do there job."
PetSmart,1ef4scnlop1h1800,2.0,"Some managers were supportive where as others made working there more challenging. This was also true for other staff, but management had a more significant effect per shift."
PetSmart,1ef4b5b8cp1h1800,3.0,"Working with the animals was the best perk, really no benefits besides discounts on pet items and food. Management was ok, could have been better at backing up pet care associates when they didn’t want unfit pet parents to own fish like betta. There were so many times my manager would just shut me down and let pet parents walk out with the bare minimum for their fish."
PetSmart,1ef3akhkep1h1800,1.0,They treat their employees like they are worthless. They dont care about the wellbeing of their employees. The only good thing about this company is the benefits

PetSmart,1ef2nmbfjr3t0800,2.0,"Doesn't work well with military personnel. Acted as if they were never told that I was being deployed. Tried to tell me that I would lose my job because I hadn't been on the schedule in almost a year due to the military and I had two weeks (IN THE MIDDLE OF MY DEPLOYMENT) to get put back on the schedule and show up to work even though I am currently 7,000 miles away."
PetSmart,1ef0j4nm2rcmp800,2.0,This company's management does not care about you at all if you're not making them a lot of money. Extremely poor and unreasonable management. Lord forbid you have health problems because they do not care or respect that at all. Don't make appointments any sooner then a month and a half and just PRAY that you have it off because they don't care and will schedule you. Don't stand up for yourself or others against management or you'll get a write up. If you want to feel like a human being then apply somewhere else.
PetSmart,1ef02rai1pbqj800,3.0,"This was my first job and it taught me a lot about the proper way to take care of animals. I cleaned, fed, and medicated the small animals  and fish daily. The most stressful part of the job was seeing how uneducated some customer can be about the care of animals since the costumer often doesn’t realize that animals need more than just a small cage/ tank and one type of food. Other than the stressful customers it felt rewarding to take care of all the animals and fish. I ended up learning a lot, however it does take being interested to learn about it. It’s good for a first job since pay and hours aren’t great."
PetSmart,1eevnh96toeea800,2.0,● Work-life balance
PetSmart,1eeuga35soe9o800,2.0,"While the compensation for this position is a perk, as in addition to hourly pay you can be eligible for bonuses, the culture has turned into something so different than what is advertised. Employees are pushed to their limits by corporate and store management to the point of burnout. This is unfortunate because there are some wonderful employees that deserve to enjoy working for the company."
PetSmart,1eerahuaqrc7l800,5.0,Petsmart was my first job and management helped me learn work skills I would need without being rude or looking down on me. It was a really friendly environment and welcoming.
PetSmart,1eeqr3u5ero5s800,5.0,One of the greatest thing working here is that you see different animals on a daily and the not so good days were the smells occasionally but other than that it was perfect
PetSmart,1eeq1a69epauu800,3.0,"My coworkers were the best part of working for this company. It's not an awful place to work, however, I don't understand where they find managers from. I was consistently lied to about my pay, and job security during COVID. A girl that had been working there for 3 months was receiving higher pay than me for the same job when I had been there for 3 years. I was in-valued as an employee and the lack of integrity is unacceptable in management. I had an awful experience in the last month I stayed with this company. Take everything they say with a grain of salt. They will tell you what you want to hear just to get you off their back and then never deliver."
PetSmart,1eep60tgaro5g800,2.0,"They are sexiest, only small females work they. They put you in uncomfy situations and make you work 13 hour shift. Customers are allowed to walk all over you. They do not care about ethical values, overall it's like 4/10. Nothing  is ever enough for them."
PetSmart,1eeoq2tqc4r0u800,4.0,Management is very supportive and helpful when you are a hard worker. Will help you advance in the company. Pay can be better for the job requirements.
PetSmart,1eenl01umr1m4800,4.0,I can't speak for all petsmarts but i adore the one i work at. The managers are nice and try their best to work with me so i am not burnt out every shift.
PetSmart,1eeng3ovpp0aq800,2.0,"I had been with Petsmart for nearly two years as a bather/stylist apprentice. Before I was even hired, I expressed my interest and desire to go to their grooming academy, in order to become a groomer/pet stylist. Managment at both stores I have worked at has been unsupportive, and unprofessional. If you want to become a groomer, you are better off going elsewhere and training on the job, as opposed to waiting for petsmart to send you to their academy."
PetSmart,1eem50dokp1ci800,2.0,"Working here I can honestly say they do not pay you nearly enough for the work you do. This is not a good job if you’re not comfortable being in the store completely by yourself. You get payed $10 an hour to do a million things in one night and also handle health charts and monitoring sick animals. You are responsible with 40 animals on the weekend and more if it’s closer to the holidays. The managers are extremely unprofessional and they aren’t understanding at all. They tell you if you’re not comfortable walking animals then don’t, your safety comes first however when you tell them you weren’t comfortable they are mad at you? They are so busy telling you the things you didn’t do right in the morning and never tell you the things you do very good at. It’s extremely discouraging. This is really funny considering they don’t do much and they sit around till the store opens. The closers leave you with messes at night when you come in even though they are supposed to have majority of things done so you can focus on your duties however they never seem to do them. They leave me with tons of laundry and dishes as well as five or more dogs sitting in their room with accidents. This place is also infested with giant cockroaches that are around the dogs. Working here i’ve learned two things: 1) I will never take my dog here 2) I am worth so much more than this job. Guys, I’ve worked plenty of jobs and this job payed me the least out of all of them and I did the most work here. This job is worth $15+ so if you do decide to work here I suggest working in a different department because they"
PetSmart,1eekben2838f8000,1.0,"The majority of my customers were fantastic, there were just the few who wouldn’t listen to my vast knowledge of animals and didn’t believe me when I told them about the work, effort, and MONEY that goes in to any and every pet. Not to mention the condition some of our animals came in (don’t look up Petsmart animal suppliers, it’s awful). The managers were horrid. I was the lowest manager and I had to do everyone else’s job and anytime I tried to help the unappreciated employees with something I got fussed at. The distract manager only cares about promoting men and if you even question why things are done a certain way way you’re written off as not following policy. They allow sexist and racist managers to work there knowingly and after multiple employees and customers have pointed it out. You’re required to have open availability (basically on all 24/7) and if you try and change it for a second job, school, or even religious stuff you are fussed at, overruled, or challenged on the validity of your reasons. And good luck getting full time, they’ll work you like you’re full time and expect you to be available like you’re full time but as soon as you start getting to that average hours you’re suddenly down to working once or twice a week. Also they pay terribly. I’d run far away!! I would give negative stars if possible."
PetSmart,1eejkuivv38f8000,5.0,Liked my time here! Good job during high school. Managers were fair and understanding. I enjoyed working with a variety of people and also helping customers when they had questions.
PetSmart,1eeio3en6ohac800,2.0,"While I worked at the hotel, I started out really excited! Who doesn't want to work with dogs all day?? The truth was it was very stressful-- constantly understaffed and overworked. We had a terrible turnover rate, the manager would hire a few new people and most of them would only last a month before quitting because of the stress."
PetSmart,1eef8uei6p0aq801,2.0,Great part time job.  The managers are helpful and the animals are fun.  It can get stressful as corporate will try to cut costs by cutting hours which then upsets customers when lines get long.  Normal retail issues.
PetSmart,1eef1kd24pjmm800,4.0,It was a stressful job at best that didn't pay for the work they wanted done. The employees I worked with were all great people and I enjoyed coming in every day to work expecting something new.
PetSmart,1eedsiqdhrbbu800,3.0,"The culture in my store was great, everyone got along well for the most part. However we could not keep a store leader (SL) or assistant store leader (ASL) for longer than a few months, most likely because of difficult upper management who aimed to instill fear in leaders rather than inspiring them, asking for input, or offering assistance/guidance. This does not seem to be the case for all districts, but this one specifically."
PetSmart,1eec9fp1jr4b0800,1.0,"Management does not equally distribute hours. The same employees stay with 8 hours a week, while others enjoy 30, and this has nothing to do with availability."

PetSmart,1eec63l76r4b0800,4.0,This was a great place to work as a part-time job. Definitely high-paced and busy through the holidays. Definitely needs to have an empathetic person who is willing to listen to pet parents talk about their animals.
PetSmart,1eec1mo57r43g800,4.0,"Best job I’ve ever had. It was laid back (most of the time) and I loved everyone I worked with. You saw the cutest animals—from puppies to leopard geckos. You would get some strange customers with strange request, people would expect you to solve their problems with their pet when they should go to a VET. Price matching was a nightmare. But overall a great experience."
PetSmart,1eebolcslrmja800,4.0,I didn't start/stay for pay...I truly LOVE animals so the job was great to me in that aspect. My personal opinion is that they should offer more compensation/hours to associates. Employees deal with alot when it comes to PetParents and even WITH proof otherwise...corporate tends to believe every word a customer says in complaint. If thin skin...not the job for you
PetSmart,1eebjtebcrdnl800,1.0,The management staff is unprofessional. You can do a good job however if they have created in their mind that they do not like you. Figure it out what goes on. I am not being bitter.  I just do not think the dogs are properly cared for.
PetSmart,1eeb2me0lrdnl800,3.0,"It's a good job, some of the the groomers are nice and the animals are great to work with once you're trained."
PetSmart,1ee9s0d7ppjmm800,3.0,"Managers change frequently, employees bigger between one another and cause unnecessary drama between one another. Training was bad for grooming, had to get 3 did teachers with 3 different styles of work to teach a group of students in 2 weeks. Very difficult to get basics if trainers and managers keep quitting. To get a good check you would have to fight each other to get bookings."
PetSmart,1ee9qgp6op36c800,4.0,I liked working there my co workers were very nice and would help if I needed it. It would get very busy around the afternoon but thats the best part.
PetSmart,1ee91jn46f333800,1.0,"This company was one of the worst companies I have every worked for. They really suck with scheduling, letting you know if they have changed the schedule. They also do not do competitive pay. And pay there employees nothing. I hated working with this company."
PetSmart,1ee64njimsemq800,1.0,"There’s not enough time to list everything wrong with this location when I worked there.  Overall it’s a fun job but management absolutely ruins it.  There may be different management now but when I was there it was awful.  And when I filed a complaint with corporate they “listened” to my complaint but then did nothing about it and the management I complained about retaliated.  I worked in the hotel, out in the store, and as one of the trainers.  I would have continued working there if it wasn’t for the management.  Also they do the thing that should be completely illegal of giving me JUST under 40 hours so I wouldn’t qualify for benefits.  And then they would yell at me if I crossed into overtime pay after THEY called me in.  Also the pay was awful.  I’m pretty sure it was minimum wage and each quarter you could get a .25 raise.  You read that right, TWENTY FIVE CENT RAISE.  They also started out not giving me my legally required 15 minute breaks, meanwhile one of the managers would take smoke breaks about 10 times per shift.  I really do miss all the dogs I saw on a regular basis though.  And some of the pet parents were great and I miss them as well."
PetSmart,1ee3hpq9nr5jg800,3.0,"Pet Care Associate at Petsmart was my first job and for a first job, it was great. My only complaint is that the animals are often seen as inventory. I had one manager throw dead bearded dragons at me. Not all managers will be that harsh."
PetSmart,1edviu8u2ohdi800,1.0,If you work the hotel be ready for 8 hours straight in a room with 10-12 dogs by yourself with no bathroom breaks or safety except for a small citronella can. Employees have to go into every room regardless if they get bit and sent to the hospital. You also are paid base pay for making sure yourself and people's dogs don't die or kill each other.
PetSmart,1eduqg2ahrgad800,5.0,You can always learn something here. Have open hours for working and you can almost get full time work. There great people to work for and I've learned a lot from them.

PetSmart,1eds271nm32k9000,3.0,The animals were poorly housed when I got there. There was dust and cat hair so thick that it'd choke you. Some of the cats had fleas or other issues that hadnt been taken care of. The cats would also fight often because they were overcrowded
PetSmart,1edrraatds37k800,5.0,I enjoyed my 6 years at the Petshotel at Petsmart . I learned many things and enjoyed being with  the dogs . I treated each dog like it was my own . In turn I felt like the dogs and their family were like my own family .

PetSmart,1edqpulmupjjv800,1.0,I was a leader at my store within a month of being hired. What I wasn't prepared for was the constant drama within management. My store leader and assistant store leader constantly degraded other employees and talked negatively about them. It wasn't a professional environment.

PetSmart,1edme446crong800,3.0,They offer room to move up in position just to get you in there and promise to promote you. Then they give promised jobs to family or friends. There is too much politics going on instead of crunching down and getting work done.
PetSmart,1edm83v9dsem7800,5.0,Offers a great work wife balance with benefits and many incentives outside the salary . The company offers  opportunities for advancement and creates an inclusive environment for associates. Of course being around dogs all day is a plus.

PetSmart,1edl50i7crej1800,3.0,"Really loved the campus and on-site benefits (cafeteria, animals at work, many events) and the culture is one of the best in the Phx area.  However, some managers were not very seasoned and spent most of day chasing issues which did not need detailed oversight or micro-managing by saying you can do something the way you want.  Then, they turn around and take your work away and night and change everything just for you to find out in the morning.  This happened multiple times.  Not all teams are like this, but my mgmt chain was definitely an all or nothing, 'good 'ol boy' team.  Nothing about capability & results, more about if they like you or not.  I saw this many times also. Just be careful and suck up to the boss hard if you feel you are on the outside.  Some managers over-react to minor situations and lose site of the primary goals.  some managers continue to grow your responsibility to a point were you are doing other peoples jobs and your manager plays it off as ""because I said so"".  Inexperienced/immature middle mgmt approach."
PetSmart,1edkn4bg5rei2802,1.0,"If you want to work for a company who doesn’t care about its employees this is the place for you!! I have worked here multiple years and I can tell you this place is going down the drain. I’ve been through 5 different managers since first starting here. Nobody wants to work for this place because the management is so very poor. Every single manager I’ve encountered only really cares for a paycheck and not their employees. Makes sense since that’s where all the money goes, cut hours and spend that money on already overpaid managers  Do yourself a favor and work for a place that actually cares about its employees"
PetSmart,1edjqehja4r6t800,2.0,"PetSmart is a wonderful establishment. You learn a lot about all kinds of different animals. If you are a lover to all animals then PetSmart is the place for you. The only down fall is the pay, hours, and depending on the store, the management. It is a part time job and you would only be payed under $10. The managers are the ones that have a full time position making way more than the associates that do most of work anyways.They hire so many people that your hours get cut. You’d probably only work 2-3 days out the week. PetSmart is more of a side job. Not one to make a living out of. All the work that the associates put in aren’t paid enough for the work they do. All the cleaning, rude customers, and knowledge thats needed isn’t being paid enough to do."
PetSmart,1edioe88rrddu800,1.0,Petsmart isn’t the greatest place to work. It depends on your management but mostly everyone looks out for themselves and ceos couldn’t care less on how crazy a store is they won’t give you hours to staff the store.
PetSmart,1edh5vh11r4a3800,4.0,"I, personally, loved working at petsmart and would definitely go back. I met so many dogs every day and I got to care for the animals on the floor. The customers were some of the best I've experienced in retail which is always a plus. The only thing that was particularly hard was when I had to keep myself from taking all the animals home with me."
PetSmart,1edfg34clpcio800,1.0,"I was given way too little hours, didn't feel respected, my requests to be put back on pet care were constantly ignored. I was working once or twice a month, they would not give me more hours even though I asked."
PetSmart,1edeaen8ergf5800,4.0,Working with pets is therapeutic for me. Customers can be rude at times but never stoped me from doing my job. Its a good job if you like animals. I enjoy it.
PetSmart,1edd271ahosfa800,1.0,This company has laid people off due to Covid-19 who have been employed for 20+ years with the company. They don’t care about worker rights. They don’t give raises. You do 5 different jobs for the pay of slightly above minimum wage.

PetSmart,1edaegshqp32g800,3.0,Pet Care department is overworked and underpaid. They are given very little time to do a long list of important tasks. They are required to know a lot of information and to care for many different animals. Pay is low for the amount of work you have to do.
PetSmart,1ed9q0cr4rnit800,3.0,There’s times when I feel defeated when pet parents clearly do not care for their animals but it’s definitely rewarding when someone listens to your advice. People at register can be stressful and complain about things that at my level I have zero control over.
PetSmart,1ed9j0ekfp2ng800,4.0,This was a great job. I would go back to this job. Great pay great benefits and the supervisors and hr departments wants everyone to succeed. They also have great vacation periods and will allow as much ot as you need .

PetSmart,1ed4stbn8raqk800,4.0,"Probably my favorite job that I held, I worked there for over 2 years after all. I loved worked around animals, and my coworkers were a lot of fun. The place was also really good at working with your schedule. Unless it was holiday season, you almost always got times you asked for off, and even then they tried their best to work with you. The only big downside with working there was that higher ups kept constantly cutting down on hours, and there was the occasional manager who had a hot temper that would cause people to end up quitting. By the time I left, the majority of people that I had started with had left, and now that I'm gone, there's like 2 people left there that were there when I was, and they're in the grooming salon, which rarely changes staff."

PetSmart,1ebppqq37ogck800,2.0,"The animals are not properly kept. The advice given for animals is not good enough. Upper management only cares about sales. You can and will be fired over dumb circumstance. Customers at some locations are toxic and a lot of the customer service for animals is that the customer is always right, but with petcare that is far from the truth."
PetSmart,1ebpbht9t3boj000,5.0,A typical day at work would be making sure the animals were ok. Help anyone to walk through the doors. And to be gentle when it came to the animals. .

A lot of people just get hired and they don't care to do their share of work which will eventually catch up to other shifts. The overnight never cleaned kennels making a good hour of cleaning when you first start. Work every holiday. My direct boss in the hotel was amazing. Store managers revolved, the last one I had was a nightmare. She relied on others to do her scheduling, payroll, supply ordering. Her ops manager was cool though."

PetSmart,1ebm0l0493crd000,1.0,"I started when they first opened in the Midwest. I worked there for twelve years as their dog trainer; #1 in top-grossing training sales every month of every year fo the twelve. The only reason I stayed that long is it was a commission job. With the above numbers, I assure you that I not only made a lot of money BUT, I made enough that corporate left me alone. I was the reason the 'current' store director, district & regional managers got their yearly bonuses, so they left me alone as well. Most trainers left after two to three MONTHS! Why? Because they couldn't produce the 'numbers'. Why? Because management wouldn't leave them alone. Why? Because corporate wouldn't leave management alone."

PetSmart,1ebhu51nircor800,3.0,"It’s good if you’re a college student, all the managers try to be nice and understanding, but you must come to them with your needs. Job can be fun depending on what you do. Customers can be cool most of the time unless they don’t understand the needs for their pets."
PetSmart,1ebeva55jr4sl800,4.0,"During covid it has been pretty rough. Working with a skeleton crew, and starting to get very busy is a bit stressful. However, the company in general is great. They truly do care about the animals and that is refreshing. Fun place to work as long as you don't mind bugs or handling small animals or birds or fish."
PetSmart,1ebdbj2mmrd19800,3.0,It has all the pit falls of retail . Everyone is over worked and unhappy. Customer base  seems to be particularly petty in this industry as well but you do the best with what you have.
PetSmart,1eban4152oldk800,1.0,"Managers are essentially do it all employees that have to clean up animal feces, push carts, and operate registers—all while running a store with minimal resources and heavy pressure to meet unrealistic KPMs from upper management. Company often does not have managers/employees back when employees have encounters with unreasonable and disrespectful customers—whom frequently demonstrate abusive and belittling  behavior. Customers tend to treat employees terribly and let their animals  defecate all over, and then expect you to pick it up (which you will have to). Overall, employees are treated poorly and hours are all over the places. Managers have to schedule employees for a couple hours here and there and crazy times (2AM-6AM, 4AM-12PM, you name it, it’s all in the table). Everyone at store level is abused and taken advantage of, while the cooperate SSG (Store Support Group) thinks of silly ideas for stores to try to implement. In store teams are barely marking ends meet with minimal resources and little or no appreciation. Company always wants things done better and more sales(way more), but they don’t want to pay for more employees or hours. Cooperate employees, DMs, RVPs, and SSG folks love do surprises visits to criticize and intimidate, and they have an attitude of arrogance and superiority. If there’s an up coming executive visit, or if there’s possibly the store receives an audit; you will work more hours, under higher stress than you could probably imagine. It’s a demeaning place to work. If you can avoid it (which I couldn’t), you should. Keep looking, this place will"

PetSmart,1eb040nsqqnu7800,2.0,"I worked for PetSmart in the PetsHotel for about 6 months. While I was there my duties included taking care of the cats and dogs boarding, supervising playtimes, feeding the animals, and general cleaning duties. The animals were really the best and only good part in working there. The downside at my store was the management team. They very rarely communicated with one another so if you told one manager something then the chances were that the rest of the management team wasn’t going to hear about it. For example: I was injured on the job and I informed the manager on duty what had happened. When I called later to say I was going to have to seek medical treatment the manager I spoke with had not heard I had been hurt and then proceeded to try and bargain with me about coming in since they didn’t have their act in line with the staffing. I went out on comp for a couple weeks while my injury healed and when I came back I gave the note to another manager who lost it even though I watched her take a copy. I was later injured again when the manager on duty that night failed to tell me there was an issue with some of the equipment. Between the repeated injuries, the lack of staffing, the poor equipment upkeep, and so many other issues, I ended up leaving. It’s good as a side gig if you need the money and you love animals but the management was awful at my store."
PetSmart,1eauqc1ubqm1v800,4.0,"Though they have a propensity for promoting bad managers, the environment can still be positive. There are a lot of good employees. Management suffered when the company was bought out by bank firm."
PetSmart,1eauge54gp33t800,2.0,"It’s a good starting out job. You learn about the pets that are sold and how to properly care for them. The best part is seeing a little one come and get their first fish or hamster. If you don’t mind varying hours and little pay it’s not the worst place to be. Management is all over the place. Too much talk, too little action"

PetSmart,1ealn4nck3dtd000,2.0,"I was very excited to start working at petsmart because I love animals and was excited to be working with other people who love them too. Boy, do I wish I never worked there. The “training” I received was about 2 hours of staring at a screen and taking quizzes and then 2 shifts of shadowing other workers (who hardly explained what they were doing). Then I had to open the pet care department completely on my own at 6 in the morning. Working with the animals was fun and cute at first until the first shipment of animals who came in tiny boxes terrified and sick. So many animals died, some in my arms. To make matters worse and more depressing, I had a manager yell at me, telling me it was MY fault that the animals were dying (I was probably the only person there who tried to take good care of them). The management was incredibly rude and condescending, even made me cry once (and frequently made another manager cry). When I needed to cut back my hours due to schooling, they consistently over scheduled me and told me they’d cut back my hours If I did my work better. The majority of my coworkers were also kind of “cultish” and very judgmental towards me and I felt like a total outcast. To put the icing on the cake, I got ringworm from one of the sick guinea pigs ON MY FACE! I also got very very sick and was berated by one of my managers for not being able to come in and I ended up just quitting. Do yourself a favor, don’t work here."

PetSmart,1eajoab8334el000,4.0,"It is a good retail job however it is not perfect. Lots of tasks to complete in small amounts of time. Time management is key. This is a team effort, to keep the store and the animals within acceptable standards."
PetSmart,1eajm90cl35i8000,2.0,"I worked at Petsmart for about a year and it had its regular ups and downs, such as bad customers and good animals to work with. Personally I thought they focused way too strongly on the customer aspect, not taking into account that we sell living breathing animals that need attention more than that full grown adult that could easily google her question. Covid19 hit and this company showed its true colors. They didnt change their hours until state mandated, no paid time off, no hazard pay, they didn't even limit customers in store or enforce the people to stay away from us. No one was required to wear a mask and we were only cleaning once a day if even then. Also, this awful company cut half of its staff down using Covid19 as an excuse, and ran us ragged. We were making more profit than ever, were as busy as black Friday, but every single day. And they decided it would be a good idea to cut staff to save money. That money going directly to the CEOs pockets since none of us were given hazard pay, and anyone who was given a raise recently had it revoked. I could go on and on, but long story short, on a small scale your store would be fine, but the company as a whole doesn't give a **** about you."

Even tho who else is gonna work that horrid shift?
PetSmart,1eafpc8k8qb9r800,3.0,"It's an okay place to work. The pay isn't bad, but the raises are nearly non-existent. The longer you work for the company, the more they begin to take you for granted. Local management is pretty standard, but corporate, is corporate."

Dosen't care about the well being of the animals they sell, will sell to people with no cages, for carnivals, horrible set ups, you name it. Treats their groomers like garbage. Dosen't care when they seriously injure a dog and let's the groomer keep grooming dispite multiple of the same injury type and drives the good groomers into the dirt by pushing them to take more and more dogs in a day until they litteraly breakdown and get hurt due to stress."

PetSmart,1ea488b7c3dhs000,4.0,"If you enjoy working with animals and people it's a fun place to work! Co-workers are super friendly! Customers can sometimes be a bit difficult however petsmart has a good balanced policy of taking care of customer happiness as well as employee happiness (for example I worked in the grooming salon and if a customer wasn't happy we would offer a discount next time fix anything we were able to etc. But of the customer was overly rude such as cussing and yelling and treating us badly we could deny them service in our salon). The pay is not competitive with other shops, but it's a good place to start a grooming career. Being a team player is valued and will get you a long way with your co-workers. Especially in the salon we all always need help at some point. It's hard when you're new and just learning and you need more help then you can give, but helping where you can will make others with more experience more willing to prioritize helping you when needed. Over all I loved working at PetSmart."

In the beginning (2018) there were the best managers, but since I left the management has spiraled downhill. My old coworkers have mostly all quit because the managers that corporate sent were so ruthless and belittling. I hope they got new management because it was so fun working there and petting animals, and talking to people about their pets everyday. The people that worked there were down to earth and friendly.

One of my managers even had a group chat with some of my coworkers in which they just gossiped and talked about other coworkers. She has multiple complaints against her and nothing ever happened. The job itself was great, but the environment and treatment I had to deal with were awful."

PetSmart,1e8vsnr3noclg800,4.0,"I came to PetSmart after working as a waitress for 3 years and working other retail stores that work u to death. PetSmart offers way more to their employees as a company vacation, 401k and other healthy benefits. It's also a place u can actually advance in if you put in the hard work. And hard work it will be. I've gotten injured and my back's definitely suffering but it's a rewarding place to be. You will deal with a lot of ignorant customers who know nothing about their pets, but u take the good with the bad."
PetSmart,1e8qfc7qjotqm800,4.0,"I enjoyed the job very much and loved learning more about animals daily. However my low ratings are mostly based on me being hired as a pet specialist, and ending up spending more time behind a vash register. I had made clear that i could not do that as i have back issues yet they would force and only schedule me to work register 90% of the time. Not employee friendly."
PetSmart,1e8qekbfoo8vs800,2.0,"Workplace is great, if you enjoy a good workout. You work independently majority of the day. The order fill workers are all good company and easy to work with, most don't bat an eye when they need to lend a hand. However, the management is questionable. It is hard to enjoy working with people who pretend to take you seriously, act like they care or simply don't listen to you. It almost seems like if you're not making your production consistently by month 2 you're as good as useless but its also no different for the people that do make their production. The motivation and moral boost management provides is as good as nothing. It's also best to keep any concerns or issues to yourself seeing as they will either target you or completely dismiss you. I do believe that for every person hired, there should be a brief examination of the persons' capabilities and place them where they can actually be successful regardless of who was wherever first. Iv'e personally never seen a company like this who tells you everyday they want you to be successful but then when you express how you feel about the work your doing, especially if you know you can preform exceptionally somewhere else, they just simply dismiss it and tell you you're not doing your job right or that you're not working hard enough. The only benefits that I can acknowledge are the discounts and being in great shape, so long as you don't sprain anything or bruise any bones."
PetSmart,1e8p95aunotqm802,2.0,"I'll start by saying that I've worked with some fantastic people at PetSmart, and that my coworkers make my experience there better than it would otherwise be. This includes but isn't limited to management at the store level. The problem at PetSmart is the company itself & the customers. The company does not care about it's employees. They don't care about employee safety or morale. It is a completely profits over people mindset. Employees are not heard at all when it comes to designing more safe & effective procedure & protocol.  They push employees beyond capacity and it benefits neither employees or customers in the end.."
PetSmart,1e8p2ffdche6a800,2.0,"While at work (in grooming) you are constantly told to either do better or groom more animals, all while the managers actually have no clue how to groom or what a typical day of grooming consists of. Pet smart is a money hungry corporation that cares nothing for their employees and will fire anyone without hesitation. If you are passionate about animals and have a commitment to them then you should find anywhere but this corporation to work"
PetSmart,1e8nq1tv1ob1q800,5.0,PetSmart is a great place to work! The culture here is like no other and the possibilities of advancing are endless. The management team are always willing to help.
PetSmart,1e8ng2gonotfn800,3.0,I worked at the Outer Loop location. I loved working with dogs and making friends with the regulars. My coworkers and salon manager were all funny and relaxed.
PetSmart,1e8l8fmhcou9h800,4.0,Petsmart had the greatest work enviroment the staf and management were helpful and friendly. They did daily reviews and check ups you always had someone checking to see if you were ok or needed help just overall great place.
PetSmart,1e8kr2cf6p0dc800,5.0,I had an overall great experience while working with Petsmart. My employees were helpful and fun to be around. I started as a cashier and worked my way up through the company as a bather and ending as the pet trainer. A typical day in my work life as the pet trainer was keeping in touch with my pet parents are making sure my curriculum was up to date and I was ready to teach a class four days out of the week. The most enjoyable part of my job was spending time with my furry friends and helping the pet parents train their dogs.
PetSmart,1e8khk33cou1l800,2.0,"I had some good days at Petsmart but a lot of bad days. The head manager is very against LGBT+ people and many who were LGBT+ quit due to him. Praise isn't given very often and many gave up trying to do their best work. I loved some of my coworkers! The coworkers are very friendly and willing to help. The head manager will avoid helping staff with upset customers and will not follow company rules. Managers also tend to ignore/blow off any lower staffs opinions. Managers/leads in the grooming and hotel were awesome though!!! Hopefully things will get better there, but you have to be willing to just stick to company rules and policies even when told to bend the rules a bit by management. Specific managers to keep an eye on is the Store leader and secondary leader/scheduler."
PetSmart,1e8k73oliob10800,1.0,"Management is terrible. People that don't deserve to be promoted frequently get promoted. Associates are often poorly trained and receive no support. People that clearly deserve to be fired somehow manage to avoid any consequences despite multiple write ups/complaints. The company bends over backwards to kiss up to customers, even when they're wrong or it goes against policy. I liked my coworkers, but I can't recommend this company."
PetSmart,1e8icbihkou14800,2.0,"As a ""Pet Care Associate"" for 3 and a half years. I can say that I love the actual work. Making sure everything is in optimal condition for the animals in our care is worth the low pay. However, when you realize that on a corporate level the animals' well-being is at the very bottom of the priority list, it gets pretty discouraging."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1e8hlc93a4t16800,3.0,I enjoyed my work a typical day would be some of the employees happy  to see you. No one passed on word of what needed to be done as far as changes. Then there were other managers that were Moody  and what about your head off . The hardest part of my job would be  having customers not respect your space  and being rude to you . I love my customers most of them were very nice and courteous and kind .  Price be there but you hardly ever saw the main manager.
PetSmart,1e8fpieeoou8q801,2.0,I loved working here because of the animals. And they are very important part of the job as well as the pet parents. We make sure the animals feel safe.
PetSmart,1e8f33dq7ou8q800,4.0,"one of the major issues i had was that petsmart cuts hours drastically throughout the year. The most you'll really work is sometimes in the summer, and the holidays. The only full time positions (at least at my most recent store) were only for managers. So if you're looking for a seasonal job this would be great. Even as a part time stocker i was only getting up to 10 hrs a week at one point."
PetSmart,1e881bb8hhe98800,3.0,my favorite part of the job is seeing puppies and dogs come in and my regular customers asking for me by name..what could be better about the job is more hours and pay
PetSmart,1e87jpm3no1mf803,3.0,The management at Petsmart is amazing. They very hard to try and accommodate you and your life into their schedule. They like to try their best to work with you.
PetSmart,1e87g9i0v317o000,5.0,"If you love pets and dealing with the public like I do, this is a great place.  Awesome for the younger crowd.  If you're looking to get your feet in the door, this is the place.  You're always busy so there's no slacking.  They promote if you work hard."
PetSmart,1e86615hoouf8801,3.0,The fact that the opportunity to advance in PetSmart lies in the hands of stand out and acheivements along with working alongside great co-workers.Thomas. The gm is one great person.
PetSmart,1e85589o5p421800,5.0,"As a seasonal employee in the PetsHotel, there was always something to do. The work wasn't especially stressful or hard, and management at the branch I worked at was great!"
PetSmart,1e83ecllpo2bs800,1.0,I was so excited to work at PetSmart but quit after my first day. They wouldn’t give me a schedule when they knew I had another job. They wouldn’t even work with my schedule because there’s other employees. They didn’t want me to do anything but cashier and just stand at the register when there’s no customers (makes no sense). I offered to help management but they said no. If they want to pay people to just stand   that’s on them. I can’t work like that. I never got paid either or uniforms. I wanted to do grooming but I’ll never go back again.
PetSmart,1e82pcq6i4s3s800,4.0,"There's a lot of work( mostly under pressure), be prepared to work overtime, full weekends and in some cases holidays. The company is good, pro employees, the managers are not the same case...."
PetSmart,1e82k8241nodd800,5.0,I think about some the animals I formed a bond with during my time with PetSmart that I can't even remember my co worker's names. I would send my pet happily knowing they are on camera 24/7.
PetSmart,1e81suicooam0800,4.0,I enjoyed working at PetSmart for the most part. It was only part time for me until I finished school. I liked learning about the care and comfort of all the different kinds of pets and providing that care for them while I was working.
PetSmart,1e809cvpgo1ev800,5.0,My bosses at Washington PetSmart are absolutely incredible. They care about their associates and the animals and pets that enter our store. Great associate relationships and passion for people and pets.
PetSmart,1e7tmugbvo1ev801,2.0,The most enjoyable part of the job is the pets.  Workplace culture is very stressful and co-workers lack professional demeanor.  Management is not properly trained to handle salon challenges
PetSmart,1e7tfl2ekocct800,3.0,"Fun place to work for those who love pets. Its a great place to start to get your foot in the industry as pretty much any job there is a great skill to build off of. My favorite part was the pets and helping the pet parents new and seasoned find what they are looking for. Management was not great at my location, which was a downside and promotions were hard to come by which is my reason for low stars. Overall however, I did not mind my experience here."
PetSmart,1e7qmbapgo2n7800,3.0,"I worked at PetSmart doing a small number of things. Unfortunately, since I was good at one particular thing, that made me one of the only people to do it. I often helped to train new people doing the job I did as well. There wasn't much room to expand past what I worked as and it got quite lonely because more often than not, despite being around my fellow coworkers being the best part of the job, no one wanted to be near my post, since it was possible that they could be sucked into doing my job as well. The best part of the job for me, however, was the regulars. They were always friendly and told me about their days/weeks and asked me about my own week. I highly recommend, if you do work at a PetSmart, find those friendly regulars you can look forward to serving."
PetSmart,1e7mu8hlshe69800,4.0,"This company has been the best job I've ever worked at. I love working here and would like to try and get back into the company. Even though the pay sometimes sucks, it's still a great place to work at. I have met some of my best friends within this company and the best manager I have ever worked under."
PetSmart,1e7mnhg3mov18800,1.0,"I don't know if this is just my specific store but, I will say that it was a hard place to work. If I tried to communicated I'd get shut down or talked over and if I tried to focus on work it never felt like I was getting any direction or help. I wouldn't say it is the WORST possible place but, it can be challenging if you would like actual direction or leadership or even just a place where you can discuss issues openly without the worry of being told its your fault you feel that way."
PetSmart,1e7m1f861o24m800,2.0,"The managers are bullies and do not care about their employees. Only about money and the customer whether or not the customer is in the wrong. I have been verbally abused by customers and then essentially told it was my fault and I deserved it, the manager in the salon bullied me and constantly and had her own policies that were very dangerous to the pet and the stylist."
PetSmart,1e7l9gos8oaq2800,5.0,"I was always able to learn something new. Everyday was a new experience. Customer service is something I love doing, so engaging with the pet parents and they’re  pets was a fun experience. I like to also mention for the 4 years I was there, my customer service, management and team building skills have improved."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1e7l93dlnoa6h800,1.0,"Was treated very unfairly. They decided to remove me from the schedule and not inform me I was being fired until my last day. Their reason for firing me was that I was lazy, though I cleaned the whole salon and did all of the reminder calls when the other salon associates went home early. Was not trained for the job I was given and told to train a new bather, who constantly stopped me from my job to help her, but no one would stop to assist me if I was in need of help. The manager who hired me promised monthly reviews to ensure I did well but she quit and her replacement was disrespectful."
PetSmart,1e7jg8i67ol5f800,4.0,"I have had great experiences and less than great experiences at PetSmart stores depending on the managers at the specific stores that I was working at. If you have a great team that's willing to support their staff no matter the cost, it's a fantastic job. However, you can also get managers with little experience in the company who focus too much on numbers to make themselves look good, and the store culture suffers for it."
PetSmart,1e7jdh1a3hcqi802,1.0,"I worked at Petsmart for about a month or so before I couldnt take it anymore. I was trained for one day on how to handle dogs in daycare, I knew nothing about what I was doing basically ever. Dogs were moved to different cages without telling anyone which resulted in multiple dog fights and attacks to people on the team. The team and management was rude and had no compassion for their members having a life outside of work. I was told not to ask for vacation time because I wouldnt get it. I left work everyday crying and couldnt take it after a month."
PetSmart,1e7haedd3oaq2800,5.0,I was in love with the animals even though I did overnight stocking. All the employees came in ready to work and we always got the job done regardless of circumstances.
PetSmart,1e7glr2dfhcqi800,5.0,Working for petsmart was one of the best decisions I made. It led me down the career path as a dog groomer. I left working for them because a manager would not allow me to pursue the business I wanted to.
PetSmart,1e7clfs4engrc800,3.0,"The people were really nice and helped you learn from your mistakes. I learned to be efficient, but also careful because you are dealing with customer's pets. I extremely enjoyed playing with the dogs in day camp, but I also loved keeping myself busy with all the tasks that needed to be done. I also learned how to manage and train new employees."
PetSmart,1e7c1edhj47e7800,1.0,When I first started it was great. Once management changed in the store and in the salon it was not good. It's a high volume salon you have to keep up.
PetSmart,1e76r83dp48h4800,4.0,"Had a great time with customers and the pets,  work could be demanding at times.  Mangers open door policy was nice if issues arose.  Some mistreatments of certain store managers caused some issues."
PetSmart,1e76c59obol2j800,4.0,"Loved working here! Great company, great employees! Everyone was friendly and got to see dogs everyday. Great for animal lovers. You learn a lot! You can take that knowledge anywhere you go!"
PetSmart,1e75h8eeq33nr000,5.0,Petsmart is a great place for pet lovers to work and shop. You get to work with and around animals and animal lovers. But unless your a manager or groomer you'll only get 10- 20 hours a week.
PetSmart,1e73g1tnghdcq800,4.0,"A typical day at work really doesn't occur.  Each day has its own duties and/or events.  I work as a cashier, pet care specialist, and my main duty is as Pet Trainer."
PetSmart,1e720eso1oc8h801,4.0,"Working in the grooming salon at Petsmart was very enjoyable and rewarding. It's a very fast-paced environment most days, as I was always doing my own work as well as helping others with theirs. Management was reasonable and generally fairly understanding."
PetSmart,1e6uqi5bl4rj2800,4.0,Personally did not like working at Petsmart. Customers were unhappy when I could not help them with vet related things. I don’t mind working in retail.
PetSmart,1e6sl6a6ubiio800,4.0,"It was a fun place to work at. Some guests were difficult to work with but the management was usually always on your side. During this pandemic, the corporation did not give us hazard pay but expected us to wear mask but never provided masks. Was let go because of seniority yet a coworker of mine got to continue to work even tho she was hired 3 months after me."
PetSmart,1e6s36i1mhe9t800,4.0,A typical work day is about 7 hours and starts with being with the daycare dogs for the first few hours and then you start walking all individual dogs. After walking and feeding dogs you would start cleaning kennels.
PetSmart,1e6nt81h6p0je800,4.0,A good 1st job or pet job for people trying to get into a pet field. Managment was always understanding and always helpful. Work culture was pretty chill and always felt like you alway had someone there to help you if you needed it
PetSmart,1e6nosp7cob3h800,5.0,Are you like my job because it is so much fun and I like to see people I can like joke around sometimes I do my job seriously and I get things done on
PetSmart,1e6mkgeduhe9t800,5.0,"Everyone who works here is a like-minded animal lover, so there is a real sense of community among the employees, even between the different areas of the store. And the variety of customers and pets who walk in the store make the work environment a very interesting place to be. I love working back in the hotel,where I get to watch over the dogs and cats who are staying there."
PetSmart,1e6ma7ci92vce000,1.0,I work for this company for 10 years and at the end of that 10 years after all I had done building and training thier #1 salon team in the district and region along side the Store director of the #1store They brought in a new district manager from some grocery store somewhere who knew nothing about the pet industry on the retail side let alone on the  Service side Out of nothing but jealousy the corporation let him tear the whole team apart
PetSmart,1e6kt7u7h4pb8800,4.0,"I have served in two separate locations and as far as retail corporation go this one is doing a lot of right. There support from both leaders and corporate that are consistent in sharing the same objective with our 'pet parents'. This helps for both the customers and the associate for clear communication and conversing in objectives. Friendliness is highly encouraged and tends to keep a positive environment within the store and through its ability for employees to accomplish daily task. The structure is clear to whom is to hold responsibility in the store along with how that role affects the efficiency. In smaller store environments it becomes an easy way to be close nitch team. Its not best for pay, mostly being around minimum wage for part-timers but a lot of growth is supplied and local store leaders get to give managing opportunists to others from different backgrounds because of the role guidelines. The pay and benefits at a leadership level are much better then the part-timer."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1e6krtuephcsh800,2.0,"even before the pandemic, it sucked to work here. they don't hire new people often and when they do they're only trained on register or stocking. pet care at my store has dwindled to 3 people now, including myself. there's only one pet care person on shift at a time. we're the only ones who can get crickets and feeder fish, catch fish and pets to sell, and the only ones in the store that can troubleshoot customer problems with their tanks or pets. not even managers can answer any questions about pet care, because they don't know and aren't bothered to learn. no one in the store is able to assist when pet care gets busy, and we do get busy. on a regular Saturday, i would have to catch crickets, catch feeder fish, process a cat adoption, assist a family wanting to get a reptile for the first time, figure out why another customer's fish are dying, catch more fish, all in the span of a half hour, and all by myself. it gets overwhelming because I'm the only one in store that can do any of this, and when i ask for help while its happening or in general (more cashiers cross trained, more pet care certified employees), I'm treated like i should be able to handle it by myself, like i shouldn't need to pull managers away to help me for 10 minutes to thin out the crowd. if i need help with anything, I'm on my own."
PetSmart,1e6kb0ssm47rp800,5.0,It was a place I always felt comfortable showing up to and looked forward to my shifts. The other staff members are reliable and management is very approachable.
PetSmart,1e6i97baknhf6800,1.0,Management are snakes don’t trust anyone there they will use it against you  bad hours for workers and they are all stuck up  you get hurt they want you to go home and not report it
PetSmart,1e6i69i7g4pb8801,3.0,"My store was very welcoming to those of the lgbt community, but lacked in other aspects. 1 manager to be specific, nothing you did seemed to please him but cool guy to talk to if you were talking sports. It was clear that they were only there to work and nothing else"
PetSmart,1e6i2i4hfp0je800,1.0,"Management is horrible. They told me that wouldn't work with me with my school schedule and because I signed a contract, I had to quit school... I have been told that my grooms are trash and told to "" just quit"" to my face. They won't work with groomers and force them to do more work than what they should. I had to put my dog down every 15 min to answer a phone or do a walk inin.inRidiculous and"
PetSmart,1e6fg9fhd4rhv801,2.0,"Was a bather in the grooming salon for 2 years. Of course all my co-workers were women. Most of them were very catty and talked behind eachothers back, including the manager. Even some arguments and yelling."
PetSmart,1e6cuqc7dothn800,2.0,Grooming experiences it all depends on your groomer some are amazing and wonderful to the animals and others are not so you just have to make sure to stick around and keep your eyes open
PetSmart,1e6aq03ngoujm800,1.0,"Would never recommend.  Promised much more than what the reality was.  No flexibility.  Poor morale.  Terrible pay.  High turnover for a reason.  Raise potential is promised but never given.  Always a reason for the lack if pay.  Expected to over perform in unethical ways.  Forced unachievable goals.  This includes how many adoptions your location is responsible for.  Miss adoptions and you will have to be on ""outlier"" calls that punish leaders."
PetSmart,1e6a54f9f25el000,4.0,"It would be a lot of customers that would treat their pets like children, they really had a strong emotional attachment to their pets, and would always be treated like family when they stepped foot in the store."
PetSmart,1e69rdqkgoujm800,4.0,Have patience and love animals. Also enjoy assisting customers. Working at PetSmart isn't a job it's a community for people with the love for pets and animals.
PetSmart,1e65ig5ca31gm000,2.0,PetSmart could be an amazing company IF you have the right management staff. I was a manager at a previous location and loved every minute of it! But I also had an amazing team with the will to help others than themselves. I left the company for a year to advance my career and actually came back but to a different store. Only lasted a year and I was in the same position as before! Store manager was a joke. Very shady and so is the DM. Be warned.
PetSmart,1e650ebq825el000,3.0,"I cannot speak for every grooming salon I have worked at a total of 3 and this review is only in regards to the last one. Management when I first got there was very lax and did not support my salon manager who had just become a salon manager and transferred there, the team did not respect her or her ideas. This made the work vibe very difficult. Then we got a new store manager and he backed up my salon manager but also was very forceful with his tactics saying Petsmart owned us and we would do what we were told to do... needless to say that did not end well. Then the teamwork was divided because there were a lot of favorites play in the salon so if a person did not like you they just would not help you leading to anything but stress and anxiety and a little bit of adult bullying. About 3 people quit and 2 transferred. For the good things about the job as soon as you become full time you get two weeks paid vacation and you do get sick days, the insurance was pretty good and not very expensive but an HMO at the time I worked there."
PetSmart,1e64or2f133ph000,5.0,Flexibility is great. Nice company to work for. They worked with my very specific schedule and treated me like family. I loved working with the clientele.
PetSmart,1e62j0dktp3nb800,5.0,"Definitely a positive work environment with others promoting you challenge yourself to do better. Loving community, every customer comes in with a smile and if not they will leave with a smile."
PetSmart,1e62504dh33ph000,5.0,"Fun animals to work with while keeping you busy, the only downside is having to clean up constantly after pets (dogs to be specific) after they used the restroom. Overall a enjoyable work environment if you are strong willed and and a passion/love for animals."
PetSmart,1e623ocms25el000,3.0,"As a seasoned pet care associate, my store managers have always been vocal about their appreciation for my work and I maintain a good relationship with them to this day. However, after working for the company for 4 years and consistently being one of the only people to finish daily tasks correctly and go above and beyond when it comes to animal welfare in our store, I have not received a raise in over 2 years. I only make 6 cents more per hour than a new hire, and for the amount of irate customers and sick animals that I have to deal with, it's just not worth it anymore. The fact that PetSmart corporate holds customer reviews over the welfare of its animals and its employees is too much to cope with, and I am not compensated fairly for the work that I put into this company."
PetSmart,1e60npa3nou20800,3.0,I liked my supervisor and co-workers.  Didn’t like working different shifts most everyday.  Loved being around animals everyday.  Pay scale was low and stagnant.  Everybody but supervisors were part time.  So no benefits or perquisites.
PetSmart,1e5vdce20hd76800,3.0,good part time job for college students to work at. Manager is great. Communication could improve but t hey have been very flexible with my schedule which is great.
PetSmart,1e5v8hgb8ouja800,5.0,I loved working at Petsmart my favorite part was the animals in grooming they all had crazy funny personality. I would have to go in to help a groomer safely put a big dog on the grooming table.I love how the big scary looking dogs are the biggest babies. If you love animals this is the place for you and a crazy discount on pet food.
PetSmart,1e5ucvir2pq5j800,4.0,You take care of dogs. Not a whole lot to it but keep in mind to anyone looking to apply it's not as easy as you think there are many animals who are dependent on you and this environment can often get overwhelming to some who are not ready to commit to the responsibility of this job. Holidays can sometimes get out of hand and the days can be rough but there are a lot of great moments to be had in a great environment if you let it.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1e5u2pefcp41u800,3.0,When I was working there the work culture was awful and the management was awful as well. The grooming salon was the worst. The main store manager was ok.
PetSmart,1e5smt41t25mt000,5.0,I like a clearly defined work schedule for my day.  PetSmart provides that. I am able to work independently but also be part of a strong team atmosphere.
PetSmart,1e5r7b1lnp0h9800,1.0,Where do I start really nasty place to work. U do whatever u want take 25 min breaks hang out in the bathroom for whenever. Nobody cares People don't show up only a few here and there no leadership. Just really poor place to work.
PetSmart,1e5q8kb88o1sr800,2.0,"Corporate is not realistic with their standards, threatens to write up groomers for not grooming enough dogs. They do not care about our safety or the pet's so long as we're making them money and not setting them up for a law suit. Overbooks staff via online booking and will complain if you have to cancel or reschedule appointments."
PetSmart,1e5nvdpi2o1eu803,5.0,"I've worked for PetSmart over 6 years and would definitely recommend them. I love what I do, I love my team, and I love the company. There's a feeling of family, and the fact that everyone you work with loves animals makes it even better. We are all doing what we love. Great environment, great opportunities to grow with the company, benefits, very good company."
PetSmart,1e5mbd8e0otid803,4.0,"Every day is fun, lots of animals to see and love. You learn a lot about animal care and handling, which in turn you teach to your customers. I would recommend it to students, they try to work with your schedule."
PetSmart,1e5jj1e9lhbri801,5.0,Best job ever!!! Best team to work with!!! If you love animals and is your passion go for it it’s worth it!!!! Company and managers they appreciate the good and hard workers and they show it to you

PetSmart,1e5imklq30l45007,5.0,"Found fulfillment in pet training and the job security is strong, but COVID-19 changed that.  As a trainer, you work with people and are relied on very strongly/ heavily, but there is no at- home or virtual options to conduct training during a pandemic or emergency"

PetSmart,1e5gv2bif377v003,3.0,"The first PetSmart PetHotel I worked at in Texas was a positive experience. I loved my coworkers and our regular clients. My managers were incredibly supportive and flexible, especially when a tornado hit my city which affected my ability to commute to work. Overall, the work environment was fun even though guests could be difficult and demanding. However, upper management often set unrealistic goals for its employees."
PetSmart,1e5gu1n3v4oe4801,5.0,"I’ve worked at a few pet stores and a lot with voluntarily helping animals. Every time I was diss appointed with the quality of care for the animals. Petsmart really goes above and beyond in making sure every animal, every customer, and every employee is satisfied at the end of every day."
PetSmart,1e5frat6potid801,2.0,"PetSmart is a great place to start if you want an easy part time job. My experience  with management was 50/50 depending on who was there that day. Bad employees that really made the days unnecessarily stressful rarely received any kind of reprimand. It’s like they could get away with anything just because they were favorited. The hours aren’t great and can be cut with no notice. It’s okay starting place, but would not recommend a full time job."
PetSmart,1e5fqhqm8377v001,5.0,"Good environment and friendly treatment. Nice people and helping nature. Good learning and training facility. Flexible timings , team work and knowledge sharing . Working facilities are awesome"
PetSmart,1e5ecsuobhdt7803,4.0,"I've been a dog trainer with PetSmart for 10 years, and dog training is my passion. They give me adequate opportunities to sell classes, and speak highly of me to customers. I would be happy to keep working there, but due to Covid-19 they are currently cutting back hours, and have suspended the training program. Management varies from store to store and year to year, but overall I have had good relationships with my managers. The hardest part of the job is probably selling your classes in the early years before you've built up confidence and a reputation. Teaching requires patience and creativity. Customers can also be very rude sometimes, but the ones who sign up for training classes are nearly all pleasant people."
PetSmart,1e5dhe0mgoui4803,3.0,"The work was humble, you are a janitor for dogs, cleaning kennels and preparing meals for dogs who stay the night at the hotel. Not hard work, you get to play with dogs all day!"
PetSmart,1e5coc6vdoa6i803,1.0,I had gotten rear ended before work and essentially it made me late since we had to exchange info etc. my boss then accused me of not giving myself time to get there on time. She was always very rude and stand offish. I absolutely loved getting to work so closely with the animals but always getting treated less then is ridiculous! I would not recommend working here nor bringing your dogs here since they’re usually pretty rough handeling the dogs behind scene
PetSmart,1e59orqc5hdqv802,4.0,This is a good place to work if you're in school or transitioning from job to job they really work with your schedule and important things you have going on in your life management is really helpful too.
PetSmart,1e59i548tocid800,5.0,Excellent company and management! Considerate of your schedule by being flexible. Family oriented. Great discounts. People friendly. Pet friendly. Kingsport location is convenient for me.
PetSmart,1e53k3ipro933803,4.0,Good company to work for.  Management was very easy to get along with. Very flexible with work hours.  Other employees were very easy to work with and helped out when necessary.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1e53bt3ceo18r803,2.0,"There are two types of people who work here: 1) people who are in high school or college working to get by; or 2) those who see the opportunity to promote by clawing, stabbing, and outright lying to get ahead.  If neither of these describes you, I’d advise looking for a job elsewhere."
PetSmart,1e53b82s3qfra803,5.0,"You will learn a TON working for PS! They stay on topnof employee training and encourage you to discuss questions,  customer comments,  concerns,  etc. with vendors. Pet adoption days are loud,  chaotic,  adorable and amazing! I absolutely LOVED working for PetSmart!"
PetSmart,1e53avntfhdtb800,4.0,Petsmart was a great place to work. They made it feel like home to everyone that came in and out. They a have to be one of the jobs I really liked. Great place.

PetSmart,1e4vg571hprso803,4.0,A great way start a career path to working with animals. There is always room for growth with this company. The job is what you make of it a long with your team   When you are a leader.
PetSmart,1e4utfi82on6m802,1.0,"My time here started off great and I enjoyed working with the animals, but over time I found that the management of my Boise store did not have the animals best interest at heart."
PetSmart,1e4spknsfon6m801,4.0,I learned a lot about the needs of many different animals which was my favorite part. Great and understanding managers who you can have fun with while working. My biggest dislike was the obsession of stats like the number of customers who walk in but leave without a purchase. Many people stop in just to see the animals with no intention of spending money and I felt it was unfair to hold the associates accountable for those numbers.
PetSmart,1e4rfqunq4rmn802,4.0,"My time at Petsmart was okay.  I did have 4 or 5 customers who preferred me over someone else, but my time there wasn't very educational (loss of words really).  Groomers there, they were very friendly and very sweet, but when it came down to it, it's basically every groomer and bather for themselves.  I was brought in in August of 2017, in the hopes that I would get to go to the all inclusive grooming school they have.  I never got the chance to go, no matter how hard I worked.  They always found something wrong with me or the job I was doing.  I put in a lot of effort being there.  I helped repaint the bathing area and kennel run.  I reorganized a lot when I was bored and looking for something to do. In my opinion, go to Petco or maybe a Mom and Pop grooming salon.  They're a lot better and more advanced in my eyes."
PetSmart,1e4qt9f2po1on802,3.0,"You have to sell and recommend services and if you don’t meet goals they send the district manager to you salon. You have your own appointments and then have to take care of walk-ins which gets very hectic on weekends and holidays. Don’t work here if you can’t follow procedures and don’t like constantly being watched. Also, most days you don’t even take a lunch because it’s so busy."
PetSmart,1e4q7gl3tot9p803,4.0,I love the safety policies. And the health policies and the equipment and most times the customers (give or take a few people who think we are not actual human beings.). But what I DON'T like is the amount of
PetSmart,1e4n02i4n4ruf802,1.0,"Managers would often belittle people who didn't fit in or coworkers would talk about each other behind their backs. The only upside to this job was to work with animals, but the education for care was insufficient and I would often have to do my own research."
PetSmart,1e4mnd7iso15d800,4.0,If you're starting a grooming career here it's a great place to begin. The hiring process was easy and the people who work here genuinely care about animals and their well being.
PetSmart,1e4m9bl8mqb7h800,2.0,"Pay is very low compared to other jobs,  for many of us this is a career and we are paid less than the starting pat at in and out burgers.  PetSmart talks about taking care of employees, but, its just talk."
PetSmart,1e4kj0mopq2pv802,4.0,I really enjoy working for petsmart and the company. They are great people.
PetSmart,1e4f9u967oae5802,3.0,"So if you're looking for a job that you can work with a wide variety of animals in a fast pace working environment with, this may be a job for you. I have to say: You MUST do your OWN research on the animals. Either bosses will know next to nothing about the animals you're selling, or you will get lucky and have a boss that actually took the time to learn themselves. Either way, the knowledge of the animals won't come over night, and this isn't a job where you should half a-- your research. The safety and well-being of the animals lies directly in your hands. So do your research, and don't rely on PetSmart's ""education"" to help you figure it out. Trust me, a lot of the curriculum is there to get you to sell animals with the sh-- they sell. Oh, and don't skip the fish education. Fish is literally most of this job."
PetSmart,1e4f328tgon5e803,2.0,"Things where great before they got bought out. The company cared about their animals in-store. I was allowed to bend corporate policy to make sure the animals got the best care. If something got sick, off to the vet it went, no need for approval. Then  they got bought out by a private company, they promised so much, better animal care, everything. Nothing changed for the better, sadly for the worse. Depending on your management, things did get better, but not always. I left because I couldn't stand seeing sick animals not getting the care they needed, and seeing the animals not being given correct care to keep them happy. Not all stores where like this, but sadly mine was."
PetSmart,1e4er4oi0o1rh804,1.0,Working at Petsmart was great until the latest managers arrived . They only care about the money being made NOT about the health of the animal or employees!
PetSmart,1e4dcu6faqbpd803,3.0,Wage is determined when hired. So newer employees doing the same job might get paid more than you. Management plays favorites which limits any possibility of advancement.
PetSmart,1e4a8bctsppb7803,4.0,"I was able to cross-train for many positions within this company and polished various skills such as customer service, marketing, public speaking, appointment taking, self-branding, and team building."
PetSmart,1e495tqklpptp801,2.0,"IF I were you, I'd avoid this company.  The management is NOT in tune with understanding HOW to build a cohesive TEAM that SERVES the CUSTOMER.  Try to find another company to work for because you most likely will be dissatisfied on multiple levels."

PetSmart,1e38t71d9oclm803,2.0,"I love working with the dogs in the grooming salon. It’s a lot of fun and very fulfilling if you love animals. However, as a company, it’s awful. Corporate is overbearing, competent managers are suffocated by overbearing incompetent management, and the company culture - it’s abominable. Discrimination and disrespect are shrugged off, no matter how many people point it out and fight to have something done. If you want a diverse, accepting, supportive workplace, this isn’t it. If you want to keep to yourself and have this as a temporary stepping stone, go for it. But if someone decides to talk down to you or discriminate against you, you will be ignored and expected to suck it up no matter how damaging. It’s a company that doesn’t care for it’semployees at all, and it’s clear from the work policies to the treatment of employees."
PetSmart,1e38ngf7ffdnr803,4.0,"The most enjoyable part of the job (applies to salon) is that there is always something new to learn, always a new grooming skill available to pick up."
PetSmart,1e38aqbqloc8p803,2.0,"While on the surface the company maintains that they care about animals in their direct care, they will do almost everything to undermine their own policies & procedures in the name of making the customer happy. Management gives no support and follows the same practice- satisfy the customer no matter the cost, but pinch the pennies when it comes to caring for the live exotic animals in their care."
PetSmart,1e3885i74o27k801,2.0,"Working with animals and most of the customers was actually very enjoyable and fun. Other regular associates were mostly very nice and friendly and made it enjoyable, however the management was the worst management I have seen in my working experience. The first store leader we had actually did a good job and was unbiased and friendly but not too friendly with his associates. The new store leader that took over a little over a year into my time there was too afraid to confront problem employees who she thought would cause confrontation, was very friendly with certain associates who would buy her food/drinks which also included alcoholic beverages. The assistant store leader would spend most of his time on the clock either sitting in the managers office scrolling for hours on the computer, be actively talking on his phone for personal calls on the floor, and go on 'errands' to pick up small items for the store where he would be gone for 1-2 hours at least while on the clock. Other smaller managers like the associate lead and pet care manager would set new policies that are suppose to limit management and associates alike, then they claim they're making the exception for themselves."
PetSmart,1e386h3d8fdns802,2.0,"After spending months training, I was passed over on going to grooming academy several times due to having a ""full class"" but management and the instructor would insist I would have a spot 'next month' but continued that cycle for several months. Toxic work environment as well."
PetSmart,1e380b4soolfb801,4.0,Does not always have enough hours allocated. This leaves periods of time when not enough staff is available to help customers. It also makes it challenging to get projects done with less staff.
PetSmart,1e37r1s08o27k801,5.0,I love my job...the management/co workers are like family to me! I enjoy going to work and seeing my regular customers/pets...i have made new friends and loyal customers! Grear place to work...
PetSmart,1e37pouk9oclm803,2.0,"I’v been working here for a while the only thing that keeps me still working here is the animals Iv seen and loved for years , it’s a lot of favoritism. Iv seen many dogs sitting in urine and not having water, for some reason they believe it’s ok to give a owner their dog that smells like straight urine . Many people here are lazy. Overnights are stressful due to the fact they want you to do a lot in a few hours. Iv seen many things that people have done that should of gotten them fired or that corporate should of gotten involved in but that I will not mention. It is far from a team , many people here talk behind each other’s backs about their work ethic , personal life etc . Many people get charged for things they did not receive wether it’s a playtime or not spending the whole day in camp. Many people cannot handle stress well they get overwhelmed and start talking crazy to each other and boom there’s tension and someone’s upset . It’s a mess"
PetSmart,1e36ihn2rocll803,5.0,PetSmart was one of the best places I've worked! I absolutely loved my job there. They were even gunna help me get into grooming school. They are super awesome!
PetSmart,1e35e7fja2v38003,4.0,My work day consisted of self motivation to help customers and their pets.  Management was a little lacking but it was a corporate run company. On a daily basis I felt satisfied with my work and the job I preformed.
PetSmart,1e35906i6ocro802,5.0,I love working at pet smart it was a good job Good job. It was a great learning experience for me and it teach me how to grow. I learn so much from petsmart i would not have change it.
PetSmart,1e34rcu3qoc8p800,4.0,Unfortunately I didn't get to work here as long as preferred. My coworkers had great attitude and was company driven. Its always a positive feeling to work with a company with great customer skills!
PetSmart,1e34nbqnso97p802,1.0,Very unprofessional very poor management. No one will tell you that your not paid for jobs you have to keep tally yourself to make sure money is correct. Management very unprofessional and childish. New staff appear very often. Turnover rate is high.
PetSmart,1e34d254jocvt803,1.0,Minimal staff with unacheivable goals. No help with tasks you just have to figure it out. Managers are condescending and show up late. Double standards. People with less experience get paid more than those with more experience and responsibility. Get written up for not working fast enough. Not a fun place.
PetSmart,1e349k07qbllt803,3.0,"I loved the work but management made the job uncomfortable.  Holding a grudge if sales goals were not reached. I loved working around animals and pet owners. Other than the pressure from management, I was happy to go to work everyday."
PetSmart,1e33c5qj5ocft803,5.0,"While I was working at this location I did both picking and packing for petsmart products and companies similar. The items would vary depending on the order you was picking or packing, it could either be dog, cat or other house animals beds, food, lining, etc...."

PetSmart,1e32tdgfpo1ts807,1.0,"The managers here couldn’t  care less about you, all they care about is making money but not about the employee who make them there money! Talking  to corporate does no good they don’t even answer half the time . The turn over rate for Williamsburg va speaks for it, they can not keep groomers because there poor management and insufficient equipment"
PetSmart,1e32t72vv319p003,2.0,"This job offered some stability. If you were seeking a lot of hours, there were easy ways to do this. There was always overtime available. The managers can quickly pick out who is putting in more effort and reward them."
PetSmart,1e32n5pn6np2k800,2.0,"I was a bather that went above and beyond to make sure the pets were taken care of properly, that my coworkers were happy, and that the salon was clean. Management, however, did not care about me because I had no interest in becoming a groomer. The process to become a groomer is lengthy and involves doing more work for the same low pay until finally PetSmart decides to pay you for your work. I was not willing to be put through that so I maintained my work ethic of being a great bather. Management did not recognize my hard work and lied about getting me a raise. So I got out of there as fast as I could. My coworkers were really great, but that differs at each location. Most groomers don't care about the bathers."

PetSmart,1e32f1ltq319p003,1.0,The work environment was conducted freely and unprofessionally ! Management was new to the job ! and  had no idea what they we're doing... They didn't even have a certified forklift to operate the forklift.
PetSmart,1e31j81grq4di802,3.0,"This job was good, but very stressful as far as structure. I disliked being left alone during training time when I did not have adequate training to run the salon alone. I loved working with the dogs."
PetSmart,1e310aj5g32nd003,3.0,The experience you get working at PetSmart can be rewarding. You learn all kinds of facts about dogs and cats and learn how to interact with customers.
PetSmart,1e30vgf25otjk803,3.0,"Overall my experience was mediocre. I don’t suggest working here for longer than a year if even that. Staff isn’t very appreciated. Some managers were great but the head manager is overall awful. She acted fake, was never there on time or at all and did not care for others. I was there for a whole year before I got my first raise or employee review which are supposed to be both done during month 1, 3, 6 and a year. I only ever got one raise while people hired on after me with less experience were making a way higher wage.My schedule was super full and I had many tasks to complete, I felt under appreciated and overwhelmed often. They only care about a select few employees and often times it shows. No room for advancement at all, unless you are one of there “pets”. Often times I dreading going to work and went anyways due to the animals needing care. I genuinely cared about the animals and that was the only reason I stayed as long as I did."
PetSmart,1e30lvrrcobe8802,1.0,"You can’t trust anyone Supervisors are not there to help you at all, they are only there to get their bonuses. If you can’t help them get that you’re gone . This place use to be great, now I can’t get out of there fast enough"
PetSmart,1e30j35sjp41c803,3.0,"My salon team became like family where we were like bothers and sisters and had each other's backs with things like end of groom inspections, scheduling appointments, team work and learning techniques to improve production times. Full time positions which are manager and Salon personnel are offered the most outstanding benefits and outside company discounts. You can have good days and you can have bad days. It can get hard getting attached to clientele, customers and/or the animals that are brought in and things happen, nature happens and when it does it makes it real hard to concentrate so fair warning, you have to be a tough cookie without being rude."
PetSmart,1e300i9mlnp2k803,3.0,"Managers are always looking to support you emotionally and never beat you down for messing up. If you come in with a good attitude, you will be fine. Not all fellow co-workers are as understanding. Most are tired and aren't really looking to help out a newbie so it's best to think on your feet and try to solve things rationally. The managers don't mind helping however so if they are around, make sure to ask before doing anything. I felt very comfortable overall. One thing I hated was that despite it being CLEARLY the pet owners responsibility to pick up after their pet, some can be irresponsible. Most of the time you can get away with pointing out to them that they have to clean up (wipes and bags are provided readily throughout the store), but some think if they walk away fast enough they won't get caught."
PetSmart,1e2vtm6ohnp2k802,1.0,"I worked in the hotel: Aside from the animals, EVERYTHING there was horrible. The work environment was extremely toxic, the people I worked with all moved in cliques and if they didn't like you it was evident because they would collectively ostracize you, talk badly behind your back & stick you in doggy day camp every single work day. Not only did I witness this happen to several hotel staff, it also eventually happened to me. All the co's (usually new) who didn't get along with the co's (which include managers & supervisors) would quit after 3 weeks (top) because they felt invisible, useless, left out and couldn't take it anymore. I was the last one to finally quit last year. I tried to stay longer for the dogs and the dogs ONLY but I was soo miserable and unhappy there. Who would've thought working at a place lik Petsmart would be so detrimental to ones mental health? I'm warning anyone thinking of working at the Pelham location, DON'T. It's probably the easiest job to get but it is not worth it."
PetSmart,1e2vaj4mjobe8801,3.0,"My co workers and I work at the pet smart in el segundo, and they are cutting all of our hours because they believe we don’t deserve them based on their bias, and many of us need our hours because only management is full time here"

PetSmart,1e2uutho8obe8802,3.0,"I worked as an MIL at PetSmart and thought most things were alright. It is a very physically demanding job, but I felt fairly compensated for that. My main complaint is that I felt I had too many tasks to complete in an allotted amount of time. A lot of times the goals they set for me were unrealistic, coming from someone who generally does well in a time crunch. Overall, working there was about a 3/10. It definitely had its ups and downs. It was easy to move up."
PetSmart,1e2uldg8lhb1m803,5.0,Have to open the department meaning feeding all the animals making sure they are in good healthy conditions. Taught very little basics on animals best to do research on animals in store to give feedback to customers or if every owned any animals use that knowledge.
PetSmart,1e2u2i85shb19801,1.0,This job takes a lot out of you. It is not easy to work with animals and people who just don’t care. Management only cares about money and how much the business is making. Petsmart does not care for the care of their own animals they sell.
PetSmart,1e2trc8t6otj0803,4.0,"Bathe dogs, clip their nails, schedule appointments, answer phone calls, give basic information about services we provide, recommend services you think would be best for someones dog."
PetSmart,1e2s28ei85itv800,1.0,"Corporate cares more about keeping rude customers whoe get everything for free, and shows no appreciation for hard-working employees. Managers are just corporate puppets and will do anything to cover themselves before their employees. Corporate does not have their employees backs whatsoever. They push for quantity over quality. Corporate is so cheap they will refuse improving infrastructure, fixing damages, and repairing/paying for new equipment that could all improve sales, efficiency, work happiness, and pet safety."
PetSmart,1e2rqit65hc36802,1.0,After experiencing poor animal care leading to nearly a dozen deaths I could no longer handle it. The work itself was very enjoyable and fun. The management team cares more about making money and sales goals than the health and happiness of animals.
PetSmart,1e2rnge1f25jd002,1.0,Management sucked completely. It was every man for himself. There was bullying within. Was promised a position and trained for it but it was taken from me as soon as I was in the middle of being trained. Hours were made for those who are in high school.
PetSmart,1e2r3vbooo9r3803,4.0,Over all a great job but they tend to care more about their customer happiness than their employees at times. I had the pleasure of working with a manager that was better in this aspect than most.
PetSmart,1e2oplj18hb1a803,3.0,Place was not a bad place to work at but had to deal with a lot of internal issues. Management could have been better and more detailed on all the departments. Climbing up the ladder always seemed harder to do.

PetSmart,1e2mvhin75itv803,4.0,"I've been with petsmart, for over 10 years.  I worked from a position as a cashier to a career as a dog groomer. I absolutely love my job. Petsmart has been a big part of my life."
PetSmart,1e2mpf363o9r3803,4.0,Loved my salon leader and most of the women I worked with. Managers in merchandising were very disrespectful to the employees when the salon leader was not present. The job itself was very fast paced but a pleasure to have all the different breeds coming through the door. Built a clientele very fast!
PetSmart,1e2medig6o2n4803,5.0,I love it I know every manger in the three stores that are close to me. They are all friendly and care. I would never regret getting that job lived every minute.
PetSmart,1e2lvsk7q25jd001,5.0,I like working for the company. We do get discounts. Company also owns Chewy.com and is associated with The Banfield Pet Hospital. Wellness Plans are offered for our pets. I recommend it.
PetSmart,1e2ltbogtq5bf802,2.0,"They base hours off their reward program sign ups, so if you work busy hours when nobody wants to sign up it'll effect your score and you'll be scheduled less. Managers are very unorganized and aren't will ing to work with you or offer you more hours. Most managers just tell you're wrong and won't teach you hwo to do anything correctly."
PetSmart,1e2ktc2uoq5gj802,4.0,"I love working with animals and making them look good, but it can become hectic especially if it’s a high volume store. I enjoy my coworkers but the salon is sadly really small and sometimes uncomfortable to work in."
PetSmart,1e2k585b8o970802,5.0,You definitely Need an inside recommendation to get in this job most the time but if you can actually get in you’ll absolutely love it. This job is definitely for people who love all animals and can deal with rude customers who think they’re so special they deserve to have the rules bent for them. Management is 10/10 and nip any type of drama or problems in the butt. Absolutely love the environment here.
PetSmart,1e2juqac1nord801,5.0,"I was very happy to work there, there's a time in the week when an organization goes with cats and dogs so they can get adopted and I found that is the most precious thing petsmart can do for animals. Just let them be there, yes!"
PetSmart,1e2jt9lfchbi8803,1.0,"This would have been a better workplace if there was better staffing, management, and store leadership. Unrealistic workload, not properly trained, bribed for full-time positions, underpaid."
PetSmart,1e2jjh6u5q5jp803,4.0,"I loved certain parts of the job when i was working for petsmart. Having constant interaction with dogs and cats on a daily basis was bliss. I was trained on many things including; grooming techniques, coat differences, dog breeds, first aid for animals, trim nails, and proper bathing etiquette. These skills I still use at home with my own animals and I am grateful for that experience. On the other side of the coin though, management can be flaky. The grooming department is different then working in the general store. All in all not a bad place to work."
PetSmart,1e2j3c2tkhbi7802,3.0,"A great company to work for, has decent benefits and great work atmosphere. The employees are nice and helpful in assisting you to grow and succeed. A great place to grow into management."
PetSmart,1e2hr1aa3oti5802,5.0,"I feel  like it's really a relaxing place to work. Especially if you enjoy working with animals. I definitely learn something everyday. If you prefer to stay in one spot for a while and make quick transactions with customers, I recommend cashiering here!"
PetSmart,1e2hh55k3f22n803,4.0,"Safety Committee, receiving product, fulfilling store orders, ensuring that orders are filled (accurately, timely and efficiently) and packaging and preparing the product for shipping; heavy lifting, up to and including 70 lbs. standing and walking, up to and including 12 hours shift."

PetSmart,1e2evfjgq47dd803,4.0,"I’ve held several retail management positions, Petsmart happens to be the best one. Many opportunities and if you have a need to help others, this is the company for you!"
PetSmart,1e2esg9cup43v803,5.0,I enjoyed my time working in grooming at Petsmart and loved working at the front as cashier some days. I mainly was a groomer and i absolutely loved working with dogs and making them perfect for their parents! Seeing the pups come in and leaving as new beautiful fur babies was always the best part. The only bad part was they didn't give me enough hours and then my boyfriend passed away and i just could not stay there anymore.
PetSmart,1e2e7g9kvnord802,5.0,"Great place to work, you can learn a lot here if you pit your mind to it but it is just a job. Management was okay most of the time. Put your schedule in early."
PetSmart,1e2ddv2p8o970802,5.0,You feel that you can learn what you need to help people really take care of their pets. It's rewarding to see customers happy. Management is good about promoting manager positions from within the company.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1e2ckg0au4rij802,3.0,The place is cool if you love dogs When I First Started Everybody Was Warming  after awhile everything went south  work hard and get small pay  management needs work
PetSmart,1e2btf1c2f0me801,5.0,Working at pet smart grooming has taught me a lot about myself but mostly dogs. Everyone I work with is very helpful if I need the help. They’re all very kind!
PetSmart,1e2bbupmfhcau802,2.0,"New hires are not properly or thoroughly trained (speaking mostly for the grooming salon, specifically), making them ill-prepared for the hectic environment and specialized skills required for the job."
PetSmart,1e26mu3nj0j29002,3.0,I would constantly be overbooked. As a bather I did not make commission and was overbooked without being consulted. This would put me behind and cause customer complaints. I was bullied by my other employees and was never thanked for anything I did although making the most money for the salon.
PetSmart,1e26ir3bbothd802,5.0,The company itself is great. They have amazing procedures and policies to keep everyone safe and happy. Its a very charitable company. The employees are pretty tight knit and friendly.
PetSmart,1e269m32qoueg803,2.0,The managers here dont develop talent and help the cultivate a healthy culture. They are overworked and stressed out and that trickles down through the ranks. You can feel it everywhere in here. Its depressing and hard to keep coming to work with a positive attitude. The thing that kept me going was my clients. They made my days brighter. Also because I was soo busy I rarely got consistent breaks.breaks
PetSmart,1e268k4odoueg802,3.0,"Some of the managers are young, and on a power trip. The managers buddy buddy up with certain employees and let them do whatever they want. The hours are not good if you’re looking to put in a decent amount of hours."
PetSmart,1e25gsbj8hajo801,5.0,"Petsmart is an amazing place to work, they genuinely care about you as a person not just an employee! They work with your schedule and if you have any interest in working with animals as a career this is a AMAZING place to start!"
PetSmart,1e25el6rkhcsv800,4.0,"Petsmarrt is still a retail job so you are going to have to do physical labor and guest service.  At Petsmart the customer is always right even if they are not right.  Petsmart is like other retailers and their are a lot of numbers to hit.  However, the leaders that I encountered were some of the leaders that I have ever worked for.  The leaders did in fact care about pets, people and my team and I.  PetSmart did leave the stock market and they were bought out by a private company.  There have been a lot of changes as a result of this buy out.  I still know some of the leaders in upper management and they do greatly care for the teams.  One of the most awesome aspects of working at Petsmart is the PetSmart Charities and the adoptions that they do.  They have saved so many lives of pets in the community.  Also, PetSmart has an amazing human resource team that is fair."
PetSmart,1e2519bn5bln8801,2.0,"When I first applied at the home office I was really excited to start a corporate career with PetSmart and was told it would be easy to move up. It’s unfortunately not the place it seems to be. The company does not care about the staffing needs within the call center. They will have 30+ people making outbound calls to check up on people who haven’t had their dogs groomed in 8 weeks, while"
PetSmart,1e24tht36f0me801,2.0,"Many of the managers were catty and unrealistic when it came to the duties of this position. This is a hectic location, especially on the weekends and holidays. During the holidays, the hotel would be completely booked, and there were still only two people allowed overnight. There were many nights when I was by myself with over 100 pets, which seems unsafe and was incredibly stressful. There was a high turn over rate because the pay clearly is not worth the stress and physical labor. Another reason for high turnover is the lack of necessary training. The only enjoyable aspect of this position was the cute and well-behaved dogs."
PetSmart,1e24r6fl1q5e6802,3.0,Get to see and/or work with animals. Some management is good at coaching and helping you develop skills. Some opportunity for advancement if you work really hard and are commited.
PetSmart,1e24lt67vp434800,4.0,There was very attentive training there; they really value customer care and are overall pretty lively people to work with. There really isn't very much slow hours there though so if you prefer to always be working on something or another this is a good place to be.
PetSmart,1e247njk30jhd001,5.0,Do not work at this location. They don’t care about treating their employees fair. Too much drama in their salon. The new management has no clue how to run her own store. Look up reviews before you apply
PetSmart,1e23rnvnpothd802,4.0,"With being a pet trainer, I am able to have direct and constant communication with my clients, this allows me to problem solve and ensure complete satisfaction as I do my job. I enjoy the impact I make on the lives of families and their pets. Making a difference is my aim and my goal."
PetSmart,1e227tmjbq51i803,4.0,"I really liked this job for the most part. Customers are 95% great! However 6 months in got branches into a trainer. My ‘area manager’ is sexist. Bulled me and my fellow trainee, also a girl, until she had a panic attack. Management did nothing. Multiple incidents. Steals your clients to fill his pockets. They also cut your hours after you branch out saying you’ll ‘compensate’ with your classes. Real bs."
PetSmart,1e227a2ddhbgo802,3.0,"Coworkers are great but, and there is a great love for pets.  The job is very fast paced and you have to answer phone calls while grooming.  A couple managers are horrible with teamwork."
PetSmart,1e21b7nj1hctm803,5.0,"I was always very busy at Petsmart, working the phones, scheduling appts, checking guests in/out, grooming 6+ dogs a day and running the front of the salon. I loved getting to know the customers as the years went by, as well as their pets."
PetSmart,1e21abup7q2ud801,4.0,"Customer Service in is the number one priority. Product knowledge runs a close second for without it, customers will not be satisfied. Answering cutomer questions sets the company apart."
PetSmart,1e2106s17o2j8802,3.0,Management does not help most of the time and things that are in need of repair is over looked. You never do enough they want you to do more dogs that you can.

PetSmart,1e1va2mbvo925800,1.0,They work you like robots. Unless you are management your wants and lives do not matter. My manger barely worked and wouldn’t give me a schedule to help compensate my sons schedule.

PetSmart,1e1uf2ai025aa002,5.0,"I enjoyed my time at PetSmart. Managers were focused on employee growth. I felt valued at this company and the pay was sufficient for the job.

PetSmart,1e1t99bh8f0a5802,5.0,I absolutely love my role as a petshotel leader. The interaction between pets and pet parents is the most rewarding experience daily.  Routinely we tend to the needs. Of our pets through a hands on approach.
PetSmart,1e1t0b7jsbm8r800,3.0,"I’ve been with PetSmart for two years. Promoted from PetCare associate, to Associate Lead, to merchandise and inventory manager. Let me tell you. You’re not being paid enough. Basic associates are only making $1.50/hour less than I am and lower level managers are making $3.00 more than I am."
PetSmart,1e1sa4am025aa001,4.0,Good work life balance. Respect among employees. Management knows what they are doing. Come on time do your work no problem. Very good company to work for

PetSmart,1e1qbpa1khc27803,3.0,The company creates a Stressful work place.
PetSmart,1e1p8dgri25aa003,3.0,"Cashiers are usually left by themselves on a busy Saturday or Sunday. It’s a given that you will be overwhelmed and your line will get long  Luckily, you can call a manager over and they will help ring"
PetSmart,1e1p19blh316p002,4.0,Petsmart does treats its associates very well but are most of the times understaffed. They mostly only hire part timers and get around 15-20 hours a week.
PetSmart,1e1o0i3o9hc27801,5.0,Managers are always helping to further your career at Petsmart.  My time spent here is enjoyable and productive.  I cant say enough about this company.
PetSmart,1e1nmi3okhc27800,5.0,I believe it would be the best place to work for. They are always eager to help their customers and makes them feel welcomed and appreciated in their stores.
PetSmart,1e1mupm79bm8r801,4.0,"Great location, onsite gym, daycare, cafeteria, and secure premises. The work was meaningful with great impact. The only drawback was that the hourly workers didn’t receive annual bonuses like upper management....totally unfair. I left after 18 months for a company that truly rewards their employees."
PetSmart,1e1lrqeomolq3802,5.0,"Check in and right away see the dogs that you have appointments with u greet them,talk to them ask questions. Then off you go bathing your dog brush out clipping nails trimming bails and eat. it was so fun working with them little dogs. coworkers are great."
PetSmart,1e1l9qhrko9p6801,4.0,"My experience at PetSmart was great! Management + coworkers make the job what it is. When I started working there I loved it, but as time went on and management started to changed it got stressful. Towards the end of my time working there, there were things going on between other co-workers and manager relationships that just weren't good and made very uncomfortable."

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1e1kf36vnouer802,3.0,"PetSmart truly is a good retail company to work for. They genuinely care about their customers and the animals in their care, more so than the Associates who work there. This isn't to say they don't care about the team, but like so many retail companies, they are feeling the pinch from the online takeover and they are going into defensive mode (raising prices, cutting labor).  As a Store Manager you are the only salaried person in the store and with the labor restraints put on you, when something extra needs to happen it usually falls on you to work long hours to accomplish it."
PetSmart,1e1k4slcj316p006,5.0,"Being a dog bather at Petsmart was challenging just as much as it was fun. While you're working with animals, you need to be evaluating their body language and behavior at all times. Not all dogs like to be bathed, or to have their nails clipped. Some dogs could be sensitive in some areas and some dogs would rather die than go into a kennel for a few minutes while you set up. Keeping yourself safe, as well as the dog, is the utmost importance."
PetSmart,1e1jsc3gv4orj803,4.0,At the time it was a fair company with growth potential but with the current online retail situation growth is almost nonexistant.

PetSmart,1e1get5cmhc27803,4.0,"It's a fun and fast pace environment that keeps you moving. All the exotic pets you get to see keeps it a fun and entertaining work place. The salon work is hard, but it passes by with just a blink."
PetSmart,1e1g83ur9ouer803,4.0,"Working at PETsMART over the past 8 years has been overall very well. I’ve been able to lead a team, meet the company’s expectations, and advance to upper leadership from a store associate level."
PetSmart,1e1foktcl25ia009,2.0,The direction the company is going is terrible they are just looking at the dollar not what customers need or require.they look and find anything to terminate you if they don't like you ...they don't respect loyalty and don't pay you enough for they job you are doing.
PetSmart,1e1ffrah0o2j8803,3.0,"decent job for college student, steady income. works well with schedule and times. interested in emotions, feelings. not a job you go to and dread everyday of your life."

PetSmart,1e1eiv4qhhctm803,3.0,"I loved my job as a dog groomer, I got commission so it paid very well. My only issue is the management was not kind and everyone hated working there. They would always joke about going on lunch and never coming back, it made for a very poor work environment and negative feelings towards the job."
PetSmart,1e1e4a6rohctm801,3.0,"I learned a lot about animals and their behaviors, as well as customer service. The most enjoyable part about my job is interacting animals and achieving things.

PetSmart,1e1cml8kv316p007,4.0,"I would have stayed but had a  bad car accident, and had to recover from health issues! Otherwise, my time there was a pleasant work experience. Downside was the commute to the island."
PetSmart,1e1bh0i0c25e6003,3.0,This store could use better management and care for their employees also the company isn’t as great as it was a few years ago it use to be a company that cared for the employees and now it’s just all about the money
PetSmart,1e1bb3obmhcjq801,5.0,"Simply put, this is a great place to work if you enjoy caring for a wide variety of animals and talking about them with other pet owners. The management team is very welcoming and friendly. More importantly they are willing to work with you on things like scheduling. They do a good job of encouraging and rewarding quality work which is needed when you're caring for so many animals."
PetSmart,1e1b6tohfhatf809,5.0,"As a cashier, your expected to keep front areas clean and tidy while attending to customers at the register.

Learning what fish can cohabitate."
PetSmart,1e1b64em932l3003,3.0,"Great job working with pets and a team and it's amazing building relationships with customers. Department management (specifically the pet hotel) needs improvement due to lack of motivation and effort leaving the assistant manager and leads to run the department instead. Work load increases with no additional labor. The job itself is fun, the politics behind management is not."
PetSmart,1e1ai06krhcsi802,4.0,When you are part of the closing team more is expected from you in a short time frame.
PetSmart,1e1a04udqhd5d801,3.0,Most of the managers at this location were unhelpful to new hires or transfers.  Very low work morale in most of the older employees. Animal care was ok and could have been improved on.

PetSmart,1e18l1s0boue0803,3.0,As a trainer you get paid the same as everyone else but are expected to essentially run a business. You are set up to fail. I am one of the better stores in my district and was given a $0.21 raise. If you have a hotel you will be kicked out during holidays because they need the space. Training is the lowest thing on the list. Every is very nice. You are paid commission so dont mess up your paperwork not recommended for ADHD folks
PetSmart,1e16677qehbjq802,3.0,Petsmart is a really good place to work. You have to have good patience and awesome customer service. The customers there are really nice and always fun to talk to
PetSmart,1e15jvlsff39u803,1.0,The store that I worked at was OK until they changed management came in then everything went downhill. If you weren’t a favorite you got dumped on . You never got complimented for doing a good job then you got jumped on

PetSmart,1e15944v1o8uv801,4.0,Work environment and people were great. Early hours with low pay made it difficult to keep the schedule. Opportunities for advancement were there if you want to stick it out.
PetSmart,1e15545og38j6001,5.0,"A typical day is busy and you get to meet a lot of fun customers. If you love animals you will adore working for Petsmart. You will also get a chance to really educate yourself and others on the best needs for not only your pets but for others as well. My only true complaint is that I have not received a raise in over a year and I have asked for one and been denied twice. Other than that, fun place to work, just remember your employees need to get paid to continue to be satisfied."
PetSmart,1e12rsf4s31hi002,5.0,I enjoy working here. The management team at my specific location is great. There are always ups and downs to any job but they are always supportive and will allow you to do what you need to do your best job.

PetSmart,1e0v7v9l0q4it801,4.0,"I had the pleasure of being part of the grand opening of the store I worked at. The starting team that I was with became like family. I had a few coworkers who were not happy in their position, but it is a retail job, so certainly not the dream. I made the best of it with the people, the pets and some of the perks. I love animals so that's what drew me in. I enjoyed my time there and wished that the Home Office was near by, because I would have loved to move up when I graduated college."

PetSmart,1e0ssegdn32l3003,2.0,"There is a disconnect between the front of the store and the salon. Which makes problem solving nonexistent. Constant call outs from team, people showing up late daily and no recourse. Lunch breaks are rare due to overbooking those who get them clock out and return to work that's not right and needs to be fixed. We had a great team minus some major issues but had management done something that may have changed."

PetSmart,1e0qtcj3tol2h803,3.0,the 1st 8 years we fine . not a lot of advancement through the company there is a lot of favoritism also. Plus senority doesn't mean anything .

The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1e0qllmpe4shu802,1.0,Just the worst! The other groomers were like high schoolers and couldn’t take direction. The work load is too much for so little pay! You have to do about 3 jobs at once and hope you don’t anger anyone. Then once an employee doesn’t like you the manager will believe them and fire you for lies
PetSmart,1e0p77607q45d803,3.0,Can be very stressful and demanding. Also physically and mentally taxing. Training had huge holes and leaves much to be desires. Education often cut short to deal with in the moment issues like sick calls. Huge company with increasing demands but lacking support and follow through. Never enough staff/hours or time to achieve what's necessary. Very demanding for management.
PetSmart,1e0osprofh6ls800,1.0,Alot of favoritism happens here. If u ever have an issue with anyone and they are close with any higher ups you are screwed. They will all attack you and make up rules to get u out.
PetSmart,1e0oed8qeouci803,4.0,"Typical days depends highly on the role of the employee. Pet Care specialists' roles include disinfecting habitats, feeding and medicating animals, customer service, and selling of animals. Everyone gets cross -trained to be a cashier. Selling animals calls for  a lot of continued learning and there is a good deal of support for that in this location."
PetSmart,1e0o65tbchctt802,5.0,"I loved my time there as a petsmart employee, I loved the team members most of the customers, and of course all the animals. The hours could be better"
PetSmart,1e0nrqc3mo9mp801,1.0,"Groomers are not compensated for the hours of customer service they are required to do. At my store there was no breaks, no lunches, no sitting down for the 8.5 - 9 hours you were there. Federal labor laws being broken left and right. They DO NOT care about their employees, all they care about is money."
PetSmart,1e0nkgqmg2v48002,5.0,"Petsmart has become such a big part of my life since I started two years ago, I would recommend working here to anyone who has minimal to no experience grooming, the bather program is amazing. You learn a lot as a bather, and then when you prove you're ready for academy, they'll send you there to learn how to professionally groom dogs"
PetSmart,1e0m9bla6hc9v801,5.0,Love it best job ever everything sweep mop cashier animals
PetSmart,1e0l01jq8blr6803,5.0,"My time at Petsmart was great. From friendly coworkers to understanding superiors, the environment present during work hours was focused while still pleasant. The diversity among staff also ensured that everyday would be an interesting one and I looked forward to finding out who I would be scheduled with everyday."
PetSmart,1e0kkqoph4sht801,1.0,"Not employee friendly. Low pay, not enough hours. Lousy benefits. Work hours were never enough. Store manager was always drunk. Assistants ran the store. Never given a chance to succeed."
PetSmart,1e0jn816k4sht802,2.0,Basically the only good thing about this job is the fact you know youre going to see a dog at least once a day. That’s it. there is nothing else good about it.
PetSmart,1e0isu07ih6ls803,5.0,"The store it self is fun to work at, the work crew are fun and friendly. The are okay to not okay for part-time workers, They take great care of the animal's that are on and off the sales floor. But inside the company it-self is not that well, always trying to save a dollar and are not to fair to their employees."
PetSmart,1e0igni2ghc9v803,1.0,"Management is horrible, you have to make time for them and only them, they schedule you when they want u not when u need it. Co workers are a hit and miss"
PetSmart,1e0hl66e6blr4802,5.0,Great work life balance. Flexible work schedule. Opportunities to advance. Great family friendly work place. Amazing place to work. Best job I've had.
PetSmart,1e0h05089q5ia802,5.0,Checked guests out at the register
PetSmart,1e0g8ftl6hctt803,4.0,"Greeting customers when I walk into the store, asking them if they need any assistance throughout their time while shopping. Ringing up the items at the customers want to buy."
PetSmart,1e0g5gu2jouci801,4.0,"It is definitely the best place I have personally ever worked but I have worked at some pretty bad places too. Most of the managers are cool except there is one who makes not only me but almost everyone else dread coming in to work with them. They are a very controlling, extremely nosey and very condescending whether they mean to be or not. Someone said something to them once about the way they talk to people and they got mad..."
PetSmart,1e0eus6rk4sht800,2.0,"Saying that you are customer focused, while truly only caring about “brand” value. Parent company only invested in PetSmart to build up its value then sell off for max profit."
PetSmart,1e0egurk9304h001,2.0,"it was good until the day I got the job. after that management left new ones came in changed a lot no team work or effort no help bad reviews online till this day, still runs poorly no team effort... I don't have supplies to clean when i ask for them.. ect..."
PetSmart,1e0eg8cp9h6ls800,3.0,PetSmart is a great company to work for if you love animals. However I would be careful with management. They can be pretty unfair with hours but other then that it is a pretty good place to gain some retail experience.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1e0eearcqblr4803,4.0,It's a nice fall back so make sure if you plan on leaving to keep management in the loop. My location is very busy and demanding but your managers are willing to work with you if you're honest and upfront with them.
PetSmart,1e0e6ie0l4sht802,5.0,"Great company to work for with flexible hours, and a great environment. The customers are friendly, and the manager is understanding in different situations."
PetSmart,1e0dv2t6ih6ls803,3.0,"I started this job as a seasonal working and quickly advanced to an assistant management position within a a few months. After that period of time for training had passed, I noticed a lot of other employees weren't holding up their end of the employment agreement, and had to act as a manager should. Ultimately the workplace was acceptable, if not small, and inclusive of its customer's values as well as the employees."
PetSmart,1e0dsacap304h000,5.0,Everyone is super friendly and the store is always well organized and everyone puts in a team effort in the store in Petsmart we are more than coworkers we are a family of animal lovers.
PetSmart,1e0dp1b75hctt802,1.0,The environment at this company is toxic.You will not be valued in your position. Management doesn't train. You will be set up for failure. Then reprimanded later on your performance.
PetSmart,1e0doot6jh6ls803,4.0,Typical day at work is you go in and get the job that's needed to be done. Very routine so there is no confusion. Very hands on with live animals and reptiles. Fun place to work if you love working around animals.
PetSmart,1e0diafb6qfrv803,1.0,The management team doesnt seem to care about their employees. Very stressful place to work. Have to learn most of grooming by yourself. The pay is not worth it as they take a percentage of what you make per dog and if you don't commission out you than get hourly pay
PetSmart,1e0d1c0r1hc9v802,1.0,"That’s all I can say at the time the manager of the store had limited experience and many mental health issues that made her a nightmare to work for. Would not recommend this store to anyone if the salon manager and store manager are the same as when I worked there. No flexibility, no support from team, store was always a mess our own store leader killed small animals by neglect. Poor selection  of products and services also."
PetSmart,1e0cjfv4jhctt803,3.0,"I had a manager that was unfair towards me, but in general I would recommend PetSmart to those who have a love for animals. The job can be among the most enjoyable job for pet lovers out there."
PetSmart,1e0cc9hsoo9mp802,3.0,Typical day at work:
PetSmart,1e0bp8vdlq5ia803,3.0,"When they hired me they where over staffed, so i never earned the amount of money they said i could earn. so i could not work there very long. Their safety guidelines are  better then any other salon i have work at. the best thing was they had a vet right next to our salon if we ever needed them,"
PetSmart,1e0bhv6blouci801,3.0,The hardest part of the job was learning how to handle poor management and overcoming the issues that would follow. The best part was being able to interact with the animals and the customers were frequently came in.
PetSmart,1e0b152paq45d800,2.0,"The Store Leader was horrible to work under. People constantly called out and weren’t held accountable, the lack of communication between managers was atrocious."
PetSmart,1e09skifb4sht802,3.0,"I loved working here for the first year. The payment was not bad at first. Most managers were good to me and tasks were fun. After a while, the store goals started to get confusing, managers almost always expected more than my 40 hrs per week and I was asked to do taskings in half of the time that I was used to before. Priorities changed in the store and it almost was like we were not following store standards. I finally decided to leave because I could not stand the standards or ethics I was working on. I loved PetSmart and I loved the culture I once worked at. However, I will never go back to a place that would make me cry often because making a customer happy would mean managers allowing customers to treat me as they pleased because ""our scores could go down at any minute"". Not to mention romantic relationships between manager and employee and while SL was aware no one ever did nothing about it.  Oh, and did I mention the pay rate stayed the same while I was asked to do twice as much?"
PetSmart,1e09j2e2goufr803,4.0,When you walk in to the place feels like family right off the bat. Employees and manger are really sweet and welcoming. Helping customer with what there looking for or even if there and looking around engage with the pet parent and there pet. Fast and quick check out too. There flexibility with schedule or if your in school. The only negative thing I could say is that they don’t hire full time employees it’s always part time sadly.
PetSmart,1e097mn120jfi003,1.0,"On a typical day, the job is okay but management feels they know it all and end up making everyone's job more difficult than it has to be when they can't even do their own job correctly. Don't ever make the mistake and go beyond what is asked of you because it will go unappreciated. They only care about sales and never about the employee's well being. Customers are very rude and racist. Communication from upper management needs a significant amount of improvement and has to learn how to take responsibility instead of pointing fingers."
PetSmart,1e08pcnjcq4ut803,4.0,I loved my fellow employees and the clients were usually easy to work with. Salon was never kept clean until new bathers were hired and management would make us clean things that are against health code.
PetSmart,1e08h38ft0jfj002,3.0,"A typical day at petsmart as a retail sales associate is that you help pet parents with their needs, you try to figure out exactly what they are in the store looking for, guide them to the correct location, and make sure that the product they are looking for are on the shelves or stock room. Once you help the parent find the correct item(s), you check them out at the cash register. At petsmart, you have to have a customer first mindset and be driven to help all customers in accomplishing their goal. The culture at the petsmart I work at is laid back, but we try to accomplish every goal that we set out. The hardest part of working at petsmart is just trying to stay busy during the times where the store was not busy and getting enough hours to satisfy you, but the most enjoyable part of the job is relationships that you build with co-workers and customers."
PetSmart,1e07790d8obp4802,5.0,Working at Petsmart taught me to be a team player and have responsibility with many job duties. Working with customers was one of my most enjoyable parts of the job.
PetSmart,1e0768ehlq4ut803,4.0,"For a typical work day its just ringing people up, petting dogs, and seeing some cool animals. The job is pretty boring and taxing on the mind because customers tend to have a lot of items that must be scanned one by one, so that can take a while to get through. The equipment at the store is very outdated and needs to be changed, I really can't stress that enough. But the most and only fun part about the job would be the dogs and helping pet parents shop for there new puppy."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1e06u0n8u0jfi000,5.0,"It's a good place to work especially if you are animal focused, good benefits and pay scale for the grooming industry. There is a good management team to help you achieve your goals."
PetSmart,1e06tni450jfi000,1.0,"A typical day working as a dog groomer at petsmart was extremely stressful. In the three years I worked there, my feet and back have been wrecked, as sitting down for even a moment is actively discouraged or even punishable, if you even have the time to sit. While I did learn how to groom dogs while there, the vast majority of perfecting my skills happened off site on my own dollar. The management was inconsistent and unprofessional, very much the type to believe throwing a pizza part was just the ticket to solve any and all employee distress issues. Management played favorites with scheduling, giving preferred hours and consistent weekends off to employees the managers were friends with, and all closing and weekend shifts to the rest."
PetSmart,1e06g81do0jfi002,4.0,Good place to work. I learned so much and still am every day. I enjoy working with the animals and meeting new ones every day. It can be hard but its worth it
PetSmart,1e06868qn4shk805,5.0,Every aspect of the job gave me a sense of pride completing both simple and complex tasks throughout the workday. While working 3rd shift I experienced many situations where managers were very helpful and able to keep me on task and work towards excelling within the company!
PetSmart,1e0659nndoaqu802,2.0,"No matter how good of a job you do, the vast majority of management (especially the Store Lead and Assistant Store Lead) will never recognize it. I worked in most departments and as a Pet Care associate as well as a Stocker, management will have completely unrealistic expectations when it comes to completing tasks (which keep you extremely busy your entire shift, on top of you having to help customers/sell animals/keep the store clean). New hires will nearly always be hired in at a higher pay than even the associates who have been there 3+ years, but will actively tell you not to discuss pay despite the fact that telling your employees that is literally illegal in this state. The only reason I stayed as long as I did was because of most of my coworkers and my love for animals. Trust me, work at a different PetSmart."
PetSmart,1e061psqth6lf801,4.0,"Overall I enjoy my role as a Pet Trainer. It has given me the opportunity to work around dogs and cats and learn about their breeds/types as well as their temperament. It has also given me the opportunity to recognize unusual or concerning behaviors for cats and dogs. With this job, you will also learn knowledge of safety around animals and how to handle different situations."
PetSmart,1e05ducve307n002,3.0,Have co workers do less dosen't work as a team get paid far more money than you and you  end up doing  more for less bias and favoritism among the managers  if you love pets enough you can overlook the cons if not than I suggest finding something else that will treat you fairly
PetSmart,1e04j51oe4p2m801,3.0,We made sure to take pride in grooming and bathing the dogs that came into the salon. We made sure to take very good care of the pets in our care. We tried out best to make sure the customer was fully satisfied with our service.
PetSmart,1e047lim54p2m802,4.0,I enjoyed working there and honestly still would be if I was not forced to move suddenly. The work was fun and you got to meet some interesting dogs and people.
PetSmart,1e03ljja7blms802,3.0,Working for PetsMart has been a good experience. However the management needs work. There is not much care of their employees or how their employees feel.
PetSmart,1e01rhcshhdbq800,3.0,"I personally enjoyed my job wholeheartedly, but management was definitely not the best. I enjoyed taking care of the animals at hand and all of the unique interactions that I shared with the customers, but management had a poor habit of becoming very insulting, unprofessional and short-tempered at times."
PetSmart,1dvv8udoh4p2m802,4.0,Petsmart is a really great environment and I like the people I work with. I am currently a bather and I work with all breeds of dogs. I enjoy it most days.
PetSmart,1dvv81d194p2m801,5.0,"Honestly I love being a bather at PetSmart. It's a lot to take in at first but once you get used to all the policies and all the information thrown at you it gets easier. I get to meet tons of interesting dogs on the daily and have fallen in love with a lot of them. I get the chance to see uncommon breeds in my area like the Irish Wolfhound, Standard Schnauzer, Olde English Sheepdog, the hairless Xolo, and so many more! The hardest part of the job has to be the stress. There are days where I don't get the chance to sit down and breathe all day in an 8 hour shift because there's so much to do in a limited amount of time and everyone and their families tries to enter our small salon and the phones are off the hooks at the same time and dogs are barking their heads off... it can be an absolute mad house sometimes and it makes you want to rip your hair out and well-I think you can imagine. But I wouldn't change it for the world, it's an absolute awesome experience and if you have a passion for animals this is a great way to start a career. Disclaimer: if you have a short temper really think before applying, there are a handful of untrained dogs who sadly don't know any better and won't think twice before trying to bite your hand off if you even look at them a wrong way..."
PetSmart,1dvv2oo9vhdbq803,4.0,I worked as a cashier and in the petcare department. Loved working with the animals and taking care of them. the pay wasnt very high at the time i worked there however it was nice to be around people that made you feel like family.
PetSmart,1dvuom7ivhdbq802,5.0,"If you are looking for a work environment to get you engaged from the minute you clock in, PetSmart is absolutely the right fit. Not a job for the lazy at heart!"
PetSmart,1dvs6mf9n4p2m802,3.0,The company sets you up to succeed. They offer training with no experience and tons of opportunity for growth. This particular location had a tough management team.
PetSmart,1dvrp6av0hdbq803,5.0,"Short training so need to ask lots of questions, good leadership, slow pay increase at first but good after some time there. Flexible scheduling. Sometimes high paced but usually steady work."
PetSmart,1dvrl0415hdbq801,4.0,"The customers were decent people most of the time, it’s just not my field of work. Things never felt like I was meant to be there at that moment, and any problems brought about only made that worse."
PetSmart,1dvrkl2j8osop801,3.0,"The company truly does care for pets and does a lot of charity work that benefits pets and pet parents across the nation. In terms of the work environment, leadership is promoted apparently on favoritism and not necessarily skills. My leaders are not good at communicating, listening, and developing others. These are skills necessary to any leadership position."
PetSmart,1dvq9ulueoaqc802,4.0,Great people. Awesome work place. Zero complaints from me. I loved everything about this job from the people to the hours. I worked 3rd shift & my whole crew was awesome!

PetSmart,1dvpkq0bqo1og805,4.0,"pet care was always a busy area in the store, everyday you had a set of deep cleans, fish day, birds, small animals and reptiles. its your job to teach the pet parents on there new loved one."
PetSmart,1dvpd8dpm4p2m802,3.0,It is an ok organization to work if you like stringent rules and executing exactly as told.  Position leaves little room for strategic thinking.  I loved seeing the animals everyday.
PetSmart,1dvp3jutlo1og803,3.0,"The managers are great. Working there was fun. My coworkers were great. Being there really taught me about time management and working as a team. a typical work day would be going in at 6 am to complete a deep clean on each section of animals depending on the day. Also feeding all the animals. i would then help customers when the store would open at 9 am. I would straighten up my department and would always be busy. It's a really great place to work, i would recommend working here."
PetSmart,1dvo2u51tq3n1802,5.0,i loved working with animals it’s what i’ve always wanted to do but the manager was very rude and snobby and i told hr many of time times and none did anything about it so i quit because i could not take being in a environment where i was constantly put down by her.
PetSmart,1dvn91fofblvk801,2.0,"I was hired to train under a certain supervisor, as I would assume that position when said supervisor moved. Within a week of him leaving, the company appointed someone else, and I was demoted."
PetSmart,1dvmud1vrnrfd803,4.0,"Almost every day, I was able to learn something new from fellow associates and customers. Customers would come in and ask for associates by name which showed how dedicated we were to our customers and their pets. It felt like a family."
PetSmart,1dvmu6thlo1hc801,4.0,If you love dogs and cats. Great job .Managers and staff very knowledgeable to help with customers questions.   Flexible hours and they promote within the company
PetSmart,1dvmqj5bknrfd802,4.0,"I’ve had good experiences here, the hotel is my passion. They wanted me to learn the floor. It’s not something that would make me happy in my job. Overall it’s been a great experience here."

PetSmart,1dvlrprbrnrfd802,5.0,Working here has taught me a lot. The staff here are always super friendly. Never judgemental. Always looking out for you to succeed.  Willing to teach.
PetSmart,1dvknj4mbblvk802,5.0,PetSmart is a great and inclusive place to work. Everything and everyone are welcome and helpful. I would like to keep a lasting relationship with this company.
PetSmart,1dvkn72toblvk802,5.0,The good is that you get the benefits like dog food discounts
PetSmart,1dvk9l4rn58mt801,5.0,Petsmart provided a very friendly work environment. They were extremely strict when it came to being to work on time due to the the that every job function was extremely time sensitive
PetSmart,1dvjun7dlo1hd803,1.0,I was told i couldnt work if i had any restrictions while pregnant. And made me continue to work on dogs over my weight restrictions set by my doctor. Was one of two pregnant women in the area. Neither of us hd our restrictions respected and were both told that our restrictions were invalid. Then was told that i couldnt grokm bc i would be going on for leave. Even after i had told them i was an experienced groomer.
PetSmart,1dvjtb3ti4rv6803,2.0,"Simply, no respect unless you knew the management in middle school.doing pet Care procedures properly was seen as wasting time to gm.if you love animals don't work here. You'll get your heart broken everyday."
PetSmart,1dvjpah1mhbf3802,1.0,"I was with Petsmart for some years and been to multiple locations, but Norcross and the management there , is a complete no go. Dogs and customers were pretty sweet and diverse. I did love my job and working with the pups, no matter how stressful. I just couldn’t take the lack of opportunities this store provides."
PetSmart,1dvjmj9uvou8q803,5.0,Awesome place for a part-time or seasonal job. Pay is fair. The work is very rewarding. I really enjoyed getting to work with the animals. Cleaning habitats.
PetSmart,1dvjibknnnp6o800,5.0,Love working at PetSmart the only thing that stinks is not getting more days and hours to work. Need more hours but other wish love working there wonderful.
PetSmart,1dvik7tlno1uj803,1.0,"The expectations are extremely high, but the culture sucks. The head of management is too emotional at times. The company worked you to the bone. They expect managers to do everything. They have only one cashier, they expect the managers to ring registers, do projects, resolve grooming issues, helping every customer one at a time, sales coach, and resolve associates, and customers issues.  The district manager is very mean,  he is micro manage all the stores, he speaks to people with no respect, and he is not friendly. He practice favoritism, if he doesn't like you, he will target you. I have been in retail for a very long time and I have never seen that culture before."
PetSmart,1dvi1tncfh6vo800,3.0,"It was fun when I started working there but when I started needing days off, it became difficult and the store manager was not happy with me and eventually gave me an ultimatum for something out of my control. Good place to work but need a change of managment."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1dvhj9oq3o1ha802,5.0,Overall great place to work. Everyday is a different day. The people are nice and helpful throughout the daily process. I enjoyed working for this company.
PetSmart,1dvhb72f4hdnc802,3.0,"The animals are cute and sometimes the guests let you pet them. Management is full of empty promises and they threaten you every day. Aside from that,  they love to shame you in front of the other employees with a chart of how many emails you change. Everyone who doesn't get so many per day has to talk to HR who just threatens to fire you and tells you to ask other employees how they get their numbers so high. Those employees will tell you flat out that they cheat. It's not worth it."
PetSmart,1dvhavk744rtb802,2.0,"Working with dogs and seeing them leave happy and beautiful is very rewarding. Store management was on several occasions retaliatory when I spoke to HR about issues in the store. Management repeatedly made employees break policy when it benefited the managers, picking and choosing which policies were to be followed"
PetSmart,1dvhabqvjhdnc801,3.0,"As a whole, Petsmart is a good company to work for.  They offer IDP (individual development program) in order to progress associates' careers."
PetSmart,1dvfampot32l0002,2.0,Management is pretty bad. They do not support their employees and only care about the money. Pay should be higher considering the amount of work they give you. Sometimes they are flexible with scheduling but they slash hours pretty hard.
PetSmart,1dvf3qkfpo1td802,3.0,"It was unorganized, the management doesn’t care about their employees, they rude and hateful to them and call them names behind their backs and to their face. Not every Petsmart is the same, just the location I worked at."
PetSmart,1dvf0g89vhagr803,2.0,"Good people. Horrible management. They cant keep anybody because they're so selfish and absolutely do not care. They dont care about how good an employee is at their job, they only care about the ones who they can control and wont see through their excuses. Been there over a year and the store lead still dosent know my name. Also managers do alot of shady stuff so employees wont get their bonuses. Awful. I'm sure some store are great but avoid this one. It will only bring you down with it."
PetSmart,1dvccovr74rtb803,4.0,"I learned a great deal about retail and loved that PetSmart was associated with and contributed to local animal shelters.  They really do care about finding homes for these animals.  The customers and their pets were a highlight of the job; however, this is not ultimately where I want to advance my career."
PetSmart,1dvc8sf32oapt802,2.0,"It’sa good job if you like animals, but the management could be better. Very sloppy scheduling and training. Time off request could be better too and animal care should be their number one priority which often times isn’t."
PetSmart,1dvc765i64rtb802,4.0,I would clock in Early before the truck with products would come in every Monday and Friday. I learned how to think fast under pressure because we had to be able to do 1 pallet per hour which was difficult at first but then I got the hang of it and was able to do it. The management was great overall. Even though I was in stock loved interacting with pet parents and their pets at the store.
PetSmart,1dvc5tv924rmh803,5.0,"At Petsmart, there are lots of learning opportunities when it comes to interacting with pets and customers. This job gives you great customer service training to assure that their employees meet at customer satifactions during their visit to the store. PetSmart has great work advancements and a flexible schedule to accommodate your needs."
PetSmart,1dvc1ijfmqflo802,5.0,"Flexible work hours,  Shows strong beliefs and culture to associates and animals. Provides great customer service to all customers. promotes growth and training opportunity to all employees."
PetSmart,1dvbv3okr4rmh803,4.0,when i arrive I do a walk though the back to make sure the dogs are taken care off and everything is up to date.
PetSmart,1dvbks9f0qflo802,1.0,Lot of bs with management u do more then u get paid 4 the manager thar now
PetSmart,1dvbjdp9458n9803,3.0,I was with petsmart going on 4 years loved it until the store I moved to manage a store was full of lower managers that came from gas stations and had no experience and terrible people and had it out from me and ended up getting me fired for coming in and trying to train them on store policies
PetSmart,1dvahs8vohagr802,3.0,Ok place to work if you want part time career standing at a register.
PetSmart,1dvac14mvf0pf802,4.0,"I love the people here and there's a sense of collaboration and support between QA, developers, product owners and business analysts.  As a contractor, I don't really have any input on benefits."
PetSmart,1dva7989h4sha800,1.0,Pet Hotel management just terrible. Racism. Management treat doggie day camp like employees are in prison. They are lazy. Make workers do their job while they are on their phone. Gossip. So much more.
PetSmart,1dva1ef68hdkt802,3.0,"Flexible hours and generally good management. Promotions within are pretty scarce. Wage and benefits are basic. Corporation implements very outdated information to share with customers, mostly to sell more products. Training is minimal and based on pushing half truthful information to push products. Stores with Banfield locations tend to be pretty dirty, they have a lot of dogs with communicable illnesses like Parvo go through, then don't sanitize properly. Very family friendly company, but turn over is high. As far as retail goes it's one of the better jobs I've had, but nothing I would plan on doing for a long time."
PetSmart,1dv99vkdnb68v801,4.0,I really enjoyed working at pet smart. I just couldn’t continue to do the 45 min commute after I moved. It was just to long of a drive each way for me. And gas is not cheap.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1dv96urbnh6vj803,1.0,"The salon crew is young, unfriendly, and always seems annoyed! They never smile nor greet you and they are closed off from the store completely! Need a attitude makeover! Maybe new management?"
PetSmart,1dv7srgeboapt803,3.0,The best part of the job was all the different aspects of pet care and learning about the different products. You can certainly get lots of puppy/dog love.
PetSmart,1dv7rj8qjhagr802,5.0,Petsmart was my first job and on my first day I was welcomed with open arms. I worked with animals which is my lifetime dream. It gave me so much knowledge and I would recommend it to many.
PetSmart,1dv7dt95s4rmh803,4.0,The job is very productive and very rewarding. It is important to work with others and learn how to multitask during your shift. There is always something new to learn at every shift so everybody has to come in with an open mind.
PetSmart,1dv6uvvvbosr0805,4.0,"The management was very helpful and quick to promote the people they feel are qualified.  They were very professional.  Truly cared about the safety and wellbeing of all pets that came through the door.  Also, very customer service oriented."
PetSmart,1dv6s51hs4sha800,1.0,"i bought a dog and he had aids and  we tried it and he gave me aids. my wife shelby has big boobies and the dog ate them.One day when I came home from work I couldn't find either of them. I suspected they went for a ""walk"" but dave the dog was going down on shelby. All in all Petsmart is pretty cool."
PetSmart,1dv5sv4qaosr0800,5.0,"Petsmart was my first official job, and my current job. Everyone has good vibes all the time, the customers are great, and associates take care of each other. I always have a good laugh with my co workers once in a while. The energy there is upbeat, there’s always something to do and it’s just overall fun being there."
PetSmart,1dv5ork2ghbnp803,5.0,"While at PetSmart my duties and responsibilities were to great each customer that came in to the store as well direct them to the correct area depending on what the customer was looking for. I would demonstrate products, answer questions and guide them to pet needs. My responsibilities here were also cashier duties, I handled money and worked a register and ended each transaction by inviting the customer to come again soon."
PetSmart,1dv5ct8haf0sj802,5.0,"If you can handle the “corporate” it’s a wonderful place to work! Many benefits, family/pet friendly, and flexible scheduling. Just a lot or ladders to climb for advancement"
PetSmart,1dv58qimlqfom807,1.0,This is a first job kind of place and I mean no disrespect. But as an adult making 10 dollars an hour and the labor is hard makes the job not worth it. You are yanked around by dogs all day but you are always loving on them all day too so take the good with the bad.
PetSmart,1dv55hrt0ov2g803,5.0,"I really love how PetSmart is and the friendly people at PetSmart as well, I learned how to fill out report cards for the dogs to give to the owners to show what their furry children have done in Day Camp. I also learned out how to fill out health carts for cats and dogs whenever they are sick or have another problem that should be recorded."
PetSmart,1dv50c34oo9ml802,5.0,Wonderful place to work. Flexible and willing to work with the employees. Decent pay for the area as well.  Always worked well with others in this establishment.
PetSmart,1dv49cqrmq4bs801,1.0,"Worst place to work at, the pay was good but working there i always found myself being mad, and I’m not a mad person. Being on the shipping dock you need trailers to load your task and no trailers. Horrible management and hr sucks"
PetSmart,1dv343mqchctn802,1.0,Petsmart is a horrible place to work. The CEO of the company is just a big bully and the management is horrible. All they care about is pushing their rewards program and making sales. Employees are poorly trained and lack basic knowledge of animal care. Not to mention the animals are brought in in poor conditions.
PetSmart,1dv2ee6i0o2bd803,1.0,"For the amount of work done as a bather, $9 is not enough to compensate for the stress, overwork, physical exhaustion, and danger the job has. But i would have to say walk in claw grindings/clipping was the worst part because it messes up the whole schedule when you get a difficult dog that should only be handled by a vet (which was often)."
PetSmart,1dv281o7ihatr806,5.0,"loved the people always friendly, don't have any complaints had fun don't have anything bad to say. my boss's were so good to us as a team, I wouldn't mind going back."
PetSmart,1duvsd4k1hatr802,3.0,Taking care of the customers and there pets. Tuesday and Thursday are truck day. Help put away all the dog treats and pull over stock. The most enjoyable part of work is watching all the dogs coming to the counter to get a cookie.
PetSmart,1duvrk8dg4pih803,5.0,Relaxed atmosphere. Great learning environment. Employees assistant program really works. The only drawback they do not promote within. My store manager is very enthusiastic and easy to work with.
PetSmart,1duviiknff232802,2.0,The assistant manager was very rude to both employees and customers.
PetSmart,1duvdesunhcta804,3.0,My co workers was great but when it comes to the hours it was up and down. But I loved working with the animals and pet parents. My kind of place I love animals
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1dutcmigi4pih803,5.0,"I would still be working there if it wasnt for the fact that I had to move for college. Super fun, engaging job with plenty of work to do, and a great way to share your knowledge of animals."
PetSmart,1dusj3h6ahbn8803,4.0,"Typical retail job, although working around animals is a big plus, and the customers are usually pretty chill. Hours are flexible enough, and schedules come out every 2 weeks"
PetSmart,1dus634s62vd4003,4.0,"The store manager is amazing, however the assistant managers not so much. As the Pet Trainer until I build up the clientele I’m barely getting hours. Not the worst job I’ve had but not worth the stress."
PetSmart,1durdr6uchcta801,5.0,"I have learned a lot working for PetSmart. I feel like a part of a team , all of us working toward one goal and that is our customers are happy and like coming to our store."
PetSmart,1dur2hih8314a002,3.0,I love working with animals and the customers are great. A typical work day for me is 8 hours. I start at 4 or 5am and I'm done by noon. That way i can spend time with my family.
PetSmart,1duqa9trlobqh802,2.0,"Petsmart, like many other big retailers, is concerned about numbers first, employees second. During my tenure there we were expected to work often with only three people on the floor (one of which would be a manager). We were somehow expected to greet and help every customer that walked into the store, set up displays, keep the store clean, care for the live pets, and stock shelves using bare-bones hours."
PetSmart,1duptkoa3q3a1803,3.0,"They can afford to pay their managers a decent wage , but they don’t . I would recommend this job as a part time job, to gain experience in a animal care field ."
PetSmart,1dupato3l2vd4002,1.0,"I dont reccomend  working there, management is only interested in getting people to work for the least amount if money, if they don't like you they will look for and FIND a way to get you out !!!"
PetSmart,1duo09evo25jq003,2.0,Did not fit with the culture at petsmart. The demands of the jib were just to much for me. I had to compete with their best worker and couldn't keep pace. So they cut me down to one day a week
PetSmart,1dunjdliphdlu802,3.0,This isn’t the worst place I’ve been a groomer at. They focus on quantity over quality and the chance for moving up the ranks is slim and if you do it’s a railroad on you from Corp. good job but most definitely not forever.
PetSmart,1dum2vfbohbqa802,5.0,"i started off as a bather and now moved up to a groomer this is one of the most best jobs ever to grow with! The other workers are amazing, the salon manager is understanding and fair with us all and a responsible one. No doubt one of the most cautious and safe work environments i’ve ever worked in!"
PetSmart,1dum2l4j3o2ak800,5.0,Management is super understanding and helped me so much. She pushed me to succeed and reach my goal. Not only was she there for me to reach my goal she helped me when I was struggling with personal things! I really enjoyed seeing all the different types of dogs and making them look beautiful. Yes it got stressful but the other employees were very helpful  when I got behind.
PetSmart,1dulvc1rc4t8q802,4.0,They have good benefits if you work full time. Management is not the best. Expect to work lots of weekends and holidays and not to have much time off.
PetSmart,1duluo0b2hdkr803,5.0,Employees are encouraged to acknowledge the pets as well as the pet parents. It's almost like getting paid to stop and play with the pups. The discounts are awesome as well!
PetSmart,1dulofmi3hblt802,2.0,"Been there for 3 years and every day I ask myself why I’m still here. Company only cares about making money and pleasing the customer. Does not care about animals or employee happiness. Will never respect or listen to employees side if there is a customer disagreement. Terrible at scheduling, does not offer you full time but will work part time employees 39.9 hours so you can’t get any full time benefits . Working with the animals is fun but you are over worked and typically under paid. Competitive salary makes everyone very upset and some people get paid unfairly"
PetSmart,1dulisi45q5d1803,5.0,Pet smart was the best job I've had so far. I loved my coworkers and managers and even the customers were pleasant to be around! This company really takes care of their employee's
PetSmart,1dulgv5l6no67803,2.0,This company has went down hill for the past couple years. Leadership does not know the jobs well enough to help with issues. You become just a number not a face or person. They tell you one thing and complete change it without notice.
PetSmart,1dul6p9rl31b4001,4.0,"My experience with petsmart has been mostly positive. The work environment and other employees are really awesome. Pet lovers are some of the most fun and positive to work with. They did better than another job I've had before at making me feel comfortable. It's a hard job, and pay could be MUCH BETTER, but that's mostly entry-level work I suppose. The work is tiring, but rewarding. Especially for dog lovers."
PetSmart,1dujjl290hbl5803,5.0,"Amazing to work there if you love pets, also great opportunity to learn new things about animals and to growth with the company. The leadership is very friendly and helpful"
PetSmart,1duj0p339hdnf805,3.0,"Working as a dog bather and groomer is one of the toughest jobs I've ever had. When pet parents come in with their fur babies for the very first time, they are reluctant to leave them with strangers. I like to put them at ease by showing them a clean and beautified animal when they come to pick them back up. So when it's time to get another groom, it's reassurance to the pet parent when their fur baby is ""happy"" to see their groomer, instead of being completely scared to death.    The hardest part of the job is stocking the merchandise. It can get heavy.  Managers are some of the most fair and reasonable I've worked with."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1duijqd3doakr802,4.0,I would recommend it as a first job. A simi fast pace environment and the manager was well at his job. You learn alot about reptiles and cats and dogs..
PetSmart,1duhdtvm3hdnf802,5.0,"The managers were great. the store was Awesome, it was a really fun place to work, and really busy. They didnt always give the best hours. There care of pets and customer service was outstanding. They were always well restocked and getting in new stuff all the time."
PetSmart,1dugtl4f1obrp802,3.0,The dogs were great to work with but it felt like management didn’t care about its workers or the dogs at all. The salon leader would go against policy and refuse to take dogs to the vet after they’ve had seizures
PetSmart,1dugr5047f0on802,5.0,"I loved working here. I absolutely love animals of all kinds so this place really stood out for me as an employee. The timing just wasn't right so I had to leave, but I was the happiest I had ever been while working here."
PetSmart,1dugfums1obrp801,5.0,I enjoy working for the company it’s very nice and laid back with nice co workers and pets and the pet owners are nice also. Good experience and good hours
PetSmart,1duftumpthdnc802,3.0,"I love working with animals and helping people who are passionate about their pets and helping them. The job is very stressful, as you are expected to help every customer in every department, especially with small animals and for phone calls."
PetSmart,1dufp7ag325l5003,3.0,"It is a good place to work, good first time job. But I want to go further with learning and get a higher position. It's very easy to learn, the other employees are always willing to help you. Good team work"
PetSmart,1dufldd713075003,4.0,"Everyday you could always expect a generally new experience, learning new things everyday! It is a great place for animal lovers to feel like they are giving back to the local shelters. Plus you get to meet new pets and help people take care of their new animal friend."
PetSmart,1duems6d50gvs003,1.0,"Worked for 3 years for this company in two different states. Store Mangers are your best friend. The lead mangers dont punish employees who are lazy, or don't use those who want to work in the right department thats needed. Example: Cashier just rings customers and stands in the front but the Pet Care who needs to care for small animals and pet parents that come in is always busy cleaning or helping in every way. They simple dont appericate those who want to help hence why I left. Only stayed because I love seeing pet parents come back with their pets and me remembering their pets name and life story if they shared."
PetSmart,1duea5avuhdnd802,5.0,Friendly and great place to work  learned a lot about dogs and grooming  for the opportunity to move to the next step and become a dog groomer  due to unfortunate circumstances I wasn’t able to
PetSmart,1due8vs7n4eif803,5.0,Lots to learn and a very fun environment. Being a cashier can get quite boring so its important to either move up to another position or find things to keep busy. hardest part of the job is dealing with customers trying to avoid taking their pets to the vet and assuming you have all the answers to their problems
PetSmart,1dudhqnj9hdnc803,3.0,PetSmart offered a consistent work schedule with hard working colleagues. All in all a great place to work but could be better with time off requests during public holidays.
PetSmart,1dudchl7iolid802,1.0,Loved working here at the very beginning then the company started showing its true colors MONEY over the pets WELL BEING. Not a company I wanted to represent.
PetSmart,1ducv2ovthe31802,3.0,If you are a child then this is the place to work. You can learn about animals and then grow up and get a real job.learn every chance you get it comes in handy down the road.
PetSmart,1ducjqf0ahdnc802,1.0,I can't say enough bad things about this location. Just... beware any job where most of the people are only there because they do not work well with humans.
PetSmart,1dubu32qlolid802,4.0,The employees at PetSmart love animals and are kind people. My time volunteering there was pleasant. Everyone I worked with was helpful and knowledgable.
PetSmart,1dubjjm6f25l5003,5.0,I absolutely love creating bonds with pet parents and their pets. Getting to know the dog and their personality is priceless. Dogs are like people's children so I always treat them like one of mine.
PetSmart,1dubavo7hhdnd803,3.0,"I enjoy PetSmart because it allows me to work closely with animals. However, typical work days are either very busy with little time to get anything done, or impossibly long with nothing to complete. There is no happy medium which leads to many unfulfilling work days."
PetSmart,1duba9hf5f0on802,3.0,The job itself is nice and its decently easy. The issue is that the managers expect too much in too short of an amount of time and don't care about anything else. There is one manager specifically that will do anything in her power to ruin your day.
PetSmart,1dub45n4phdnc800,1.0,"Store manager for over 12 years  and when they want you gone , SSG backs DM to back you into a corner    Longevity and higher paying managers have been let go due to costs  however you are made to resign because of the pressure and hostile work conditions   In store staff in limited so as salary, you have no choice but to work over 50 plus hours"
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1du9muibs0gvs003,1.0,"This company is absolute garbage. Animals are constantly being mistreated, and half show up dead on the truck, despite ""Vet Certification.""  Bedding for small animals has switched to wood shavings to ""save money,"" which was called by corporate, despite it being known to cause respiratory failure. Care guides are terribly misinformed and habitat kits are useless because they advertise animals as toys instead of breathing creatures. Employees generally know nothing about keeping anything besides a dog or cat."
PetSmart,1du9f8duk3075002,1.0,This is a great company to work for if you're good at butt kissing.  I witnessed several amazing associates/managers get terminated because the corporate level big wigs didn't like them.  The store I worked for was in the top 20 for their performance and the store manager was termed because an associate called associate relations on this manager.
PetSmart,1du97o7grolid801,1.0,"So i can't speak for the rest of the store, because i never worked that part. But what i do know is that no one should ever take their pets in for grooming. I have seen first hand that they treat the animals with little to no respect, often hurting them just to get the job done."
PetSmart,1du9741quhdnc803,5.0,"I got horrible hours and got randomly 2 weeks off. Couldn't pay my bills with the kind of hours I got. I do not recommend the Independence, MO location for that reason, especially for the seasonal postition"
PetSmart,1du8ffnopobrp802,1.0,"•doesn’t help you, just criticizes"
PetSmart,1du7v91f24eif801,4.0,"My time at PetSmart was cut short due to a disgruntled manager. Overall it is not a bad place to work. There are benifits, and oportunity to make money as a Pet groomer."
PetSmart,1du69qdaf3075003,4.0,Petcare is always busy with tasks but register can be very slow and make the shift even longer. Not knowing about every single product can make customers get aggravated but most of the time a manager can answer it easily.
PetSmart,1du69m73ghe31802,5.0,I would come in and we would do our morning stretches and then we would go on and get our a710s and head to our first locations where we pick our product.
PetSmart,1du5u0sft0gvs001,4.0,"I liked working with all the animals. I enjoyed talking to and helping the customers. I loved highlighting the products I supported. However, I wish there had been more hours offered."
PetSmart,1du5qebpihe31802,5.0,"I've worked at two different PetSmart locations, and both times I absolutely loved the company, customers, and employees. It's an amazing place to work and to start a career."
PetSmart,1du5is01225l5003,2.0,"Dont get me wrong I'm grateful  for the job that taught me a passion  I had no Idea i had in me,   but  the lack in management that doesnt have the experience  to further me to be the best groomer I can be is holding me back from being better. The horrible  hrs that holds me back from being there for my children this is the reasoning  of looking somewhere else."
PetSmart,1du5f5d24he31801,1.0,"PetSmart acts as if they care about their animals in house, but unfortunately this is not the case. After working at 2 locations for over 2 years, I couldn't handle the emotional distress caused by constantly seeing animals for sale get sick/die or having animals returned for the same reason. The company does not allow enough staff or time to allow proper care for these poor critters."
PetSmart,1du5buu9c58kr802,5.0,"Very good place to work. Friendly people and very helpful to animals. Manager is very easy to work with.  Always learning something about animals. Customers are very friendly. They work with the adopting the animals out to good people who will take care of them, and give them a good home."
PetSmart,1du3s7b96h6l9802,4.0,"If you enjoy going to work and being kissed by your customers every day this the place to be. Puppy kisses are in full supply. It's a very hard and demanding job and you will be required to do what your hired on for and work your shift to it's fullest. There's no time to waist. We do what we do for the people who help us survive, our customers. It's very fun just need to be adult about what yourdoing."
PetSmart,1du2umg8mod5u802,4.0,"I truly enjoyed my time with Petsmart and honestly miss it sometimes. When part-time, the pay is not ideal and neither are the hours, but it’s a fulfilling job for a student needing part time work and is a lover of animals."
PetSmart,1du1gfjffp04r801,2.0,"If you plan on working in the petcare department beware. The training given for this department is incredibly lacking. The official training program will teach you next to nothing about the animals you must care for. The monthly videos are equally as ineffective and often blatantly wrong. As an employee, you are expected to keep poorly bred unhealthy animals alive long enough to be sold to families who often know nothing about the animals being purchased. In day-to-day care, you are given short amounts of time to complete detailed cleanings and care for animals not being cleaned. Most of the time pet safety and health are pushed to the side as profits are always prioritized. However, IF you get good managers this can be mitigated. That being said management quality varies dramatically from store to store."
PetSmart,1du1cnhe3q3ne803,5.0,It would get stressful but everyone there was very helpful. If I needed help someone was always willing to help. I felt accomplished when I was able to complete a task that was harder.
PetSmart,1du1bsphif12j800,1.0,Management plays favorites and its usually the associates that kiss a** instead of actually working it’s very frustrating. The people who work hard get the least amount of respect and while the ones that kiss a** will get the praise. It’s the most annoying when they rely on just 2 people to do everything in one shift. They would rather overwork you instead of getting the right amount of people to do the work.
PetSmart,1du13it00o98o803,1.0,"Started off great! Worked hard and got recognized for it and earned a promotion. Then It went downhill fast. HAD to sell so many puppy coupon books a week or else, HAD to push the donation stuffed animals down EVERY CUSTOMERS THROATS, HAD to sell so many training classes a week. If not, corporate would come down on the store with an axe. Made me feel like a greasy used car salesman because every time I saw someone with a puppy, I would rush to try to push all this stuff on them so I didn't get in trouble or lose my job."
PetSmart,1du11k3grod5u803,5.0,This job is perfect for people who have a passion to learn about and take care of various types of animals. I learn something new every day and I feel that I have become a better person because of my experiences.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1du101aqbh6l9800,2.0,The pay doesn’t compare to all the work you put in this place. The dogs were great but the staff was separated. There’s favoritism as well. Wouldn’t go back to here.
PetSmart,1du0q3ohpod5u803,3.0,"I was hired to be Pet Care but at some point without being notified by management, I was never scheduled in Pet Care ever again. Only cashier or customer service. When I asked about it to management, my assistant store leader said that I was under-qualified. I was so confused and angry."
PetSmart,1du0ogotkotvv802,2.0,"Its was a great chance to collect new found skills and get my foot in the door so to speak when it comes to animal care. But how the company was ran via management made it very difficult for a long term associate to grow in a position. I handled a huge majority of tasks ranging from pet care, stock, sales coaching, cashier, training new employees, picking orders and helping managers with their duties. Petsmart does a lot of amazing charity events to help local animals in the area find good homes however the lack of empathy and understanding from management was appalling. Due to the everyday work environment and management team it made it incredibly difficult for all store associates to complete their given tasks with 100% success. So over all as an associate you don’t get paid enough for the hard labor you have to do and were often treated poorly."
PetSmart,1du0lajtd4rlm802,4.0,Overall a good enviornment to work at with the right managment and team mindset. Benefits are also good when having pets at home you can profit frimhealth care is o mk ly available for fill time personal and those are limited at the store
PetSmart,1dtv1pbdjq3ne803,4.0,"Overall nice job, though for all the work I had to do as a Pet Care associate I felt I should have been compensated more. Being with the animals is always nice, but it can get stressful when having to take care of the animals AND customers. Managers sometimes micro manage as if the Pet Care team doesn't have so much to do already."
PetSmart,1dtu87o0hhbln803,3.0,Management in my section was amazing and gravitating. Corporate however will go over managers heads and often lets scammers get away with scamming. Causing the bottom line to be hurt.
PetSmart,1dttp6ddho98o803,1.0,"When I first started working there, I didn’t understand why everyone was like you’ll get tired of it quick, then it hit me. Management will sell you a dream, tell you you’ll get all these hours, and then just go back on their word."
PetSmart,1dttieedfq3ne803,3.0,Great job but I’m ready to move up I’ve been there for 3/years great place to find your self nice place to work but I’m just looking for a new and more meaningful job
PetSmart,1dtsfqju4q59n803,3.0,"Groomers have a appts scheduled  available for the day, week ,month  for each worker, You must have good customer service skills to take phone calls, answer any questions and book appts for pet parents.  Check in pets and have good listening skills to understand what they want for their pet and also be able to communicate well to explain options and expectations. Offer our services and recommend  products that could benefit their pet.  Groomers get paid commission and hourly pay,   Bathers are only hourly and mostly part time. But you have opportunities to advance to a full time groomer by taking the company paid groomer academy classes. Its a very fun experience but the only downfall is management that  play favorites or other issues that result in low productivity and results due to mismanagement."
PetSmart,1dtrcpu64had1806,3.0,"Really fun place to work, however constant changes from corporate can become overwhelming. Good benefits if full time. Will be a physically demanding job."
PetSmart,1dtpv2p3ehad1801,5.0,Working with dogs is very rewarding. Co-workers are friendly. Managers are very understanding. They Accommodate to you're schedule. Break time is fair.
PetSmart,1dtpr3re8q4ms802,4.0,"Good company to work , offers great benefits for full time associates , flexible work schedule , trained in all areas of the store , allowed to wear jeans to work and they provide a shirt for associates to wear"
PetSmart,1dtpng9c6nh9j802,4.0,"Typical retail drawbacks, otherwise good company to work for.  Mixture of outside hiring and internal promotions. You will do well if you own your own development."
PetSmart,1dtpbg0ntq59n801,1.0,"I only work in the hotel so I can only speak for it, but from my experience the scheduling is terrible. You are expected to work any day of the week, especially holidays. They will ask you what your hour and shift preference is, but ignore it during the holidays. Unless you are a senior, you will have no say in what dogs are allowed in a camp. You cannot ask associates to do things for you, and you will not be told pieces of key information, to the point where some of these points can result in you getting fired if violated. The job itself is about what is to be expected. Watch over the dogs, keep them clean, fed, watered, and entertained as possible. A fairly enjoyable job, but the Management and especially corporate make it a extremely unfriendly and stressful work environment."
PetSmart,1dtord3uanh9j802,5.0,Best retail to work in when you get to surround yourself with pets and pet parents. The most enjoyable part of the day is interacting with the pets. The hardest part of the job was running out of product that the customer wants for their pets. The culture was very good because everyone that worked their was very passionate about pets.
PetSmart,1dtl4m9vh33nu000,3.0,For the most part it was a very fun work environment with certain management but could be an extremely bad vibe environment with others. My opinion and point of views were accepted by most and respected by most. Great starter job for animal lovers.
PetSmart,1dtl2iqh4nh9j806,2.0,I would not recommend anyone to work for this company if you actually need money to survive. The pay for groomers is a joke in California and its set up so you can’t make money. Petsmart has all these rules for “animals safety” yet they make you answer the phones and schedule appts all the while tending to dogs needs and actually grooming them. Taking dogs on and off the tables multiple times to answer the phones is in no way safe or conducive to grooming dogs. There is so much drama also at the store I worked at that it is not a good environment to work in. Also I was threatened by management because I chose to leave because i was offered a better job. I am the sole provider of my family and had get a better paying to survive yet i was harassed right before leaving. Totally unprofessional in every shape and form. One of the worst jobs ive ever had. It was so bad i pert after 3 months.
PetSmart,1dtkvr8gmq3ma803,5.0,I learned so much from everyone that I worked with and always felt comfortable there. I love animals and getting to see them everyday and learn how to take care of them filled me with a sense of purpose. Organizing adoption days and working with local shelters was also a really great part of the job. The hardest part was pitching any of the promotions or coupons we offered but once you find your rhythm it gets easier.
PetSmart,1dtkt49d0nh9j802,5.0,"I absolutely love working with animals, I absolutely loved working with petsmart in the grooming department, customers and pets were an absolute pleasure, as well as my co-workers/ management, the only reason I no longer work here is because full time hours are only offered to managers and groomers... so ultimately I needed something more to maintain my family ☺️ Would definitely recommend this job to a college e student, or someone just looking for a supplement job,"
PetSmart,1dtk49l0133nc000,3.0,"Not a lot of understanding about work life balance, weird hours for grooming salon, when it's slow you make no money, floor management is more understanding than anyone in the salon"
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1dtjsmj1bq59n803,3.0,"I liked working for Petsmart, i learned a lot about different pet products. The management at my store wasn't that great. I was a closing manager myself and sometimes it felt like i was the only manager working all weekends every week, while the other managers took at least one weekend day off a week. Store managers try to push you hard to sell things to customers and sometimes that feels uncomfortable trying to shove products to customers. The discounts were great."
PetSmart,1dtifo2bdq59n801,1.0,"Favoritism was the main culprit of the problem. Besides pretending they care about pets, they lacked poor management and would let some people get away with a lot of things; other employees would be written up for the most ridiculous things."
PetSmart,1dti9rnsv33nc002,4.0,The work environment is always a learning field and growing as a team is a big goal in the work place. No one is left out when it comes to learning the ropes on how the job works. You build together as a team but learn to grow as an individual.
PetSmart,1dthvd01bhad1803,4.0,"I started working during my senior year of high school, and It was great, the customers and co-workers were very friendly, the only problem that I had was I barely got more then 16 hours a week even during the summer, but you do get paid weekly"
PetSmart,1dth6ereuq4ms802,3.0,"Coaching and teaching associates to bring the best experience to our customers while upholding the values of the company was my highest priority. My customers, their animals, as well as my associates kept me with the company for 17 years."
PetSmart,1dtgtfbqn33nu000,5.0,"Great place to work but eventually working weekend shift 12 hours will get old. So far working with the company i have no complaints. Things can get heavy and near future, i believe will be wear and tear on the body, so take care of your body."
PetSmart,1dtgqllj633nu003,4.0,Treated me well as a company. No complaints. Not great pay though. Could be better with raises and not have a max for each position. Flexible with work/life balance. Not many full time employees. Usually you have to be willing to commute or relocate for any advancement.
PetSmart,1dtfs06tlq3m9800,3.0,Great customer relationships good relationships with management. Coworkers work together in order to efficiently get work loads completed. Get to work with many different types of animals.
PetSmart,1dtfbbcv1p04r803,4.0,I learned great customer service skills
PetSmart,1dtec8nvknh9j801,3.0,PetSmart is a okay company to work in.
PetSmart,1dtd6kotsf12j800,4.0,PetSmart is a good company . Going through a lot of changes but most are for the better of the company to continue growing in the retail field . As with any company you will have your challenges but you’re paid to handle those challenges as a leader and will get the support from your peers and district leader.
PetSmart,1dtc7v1j5q3m9804,3.0,I appreciated my time working at petsmart but the hours and location were a conflict for me. my education and safety are my top priority and clashed while working here.
PetSmart,1dtavt5pnq4ms803,1.0,Don’t reach out to corporate you will get fired after that they don’t write incident reports ! Got hurt on job they did nothing !!! Don’t want you to be full time ever !!! Don’t work here worse place ever
PetSmart,1dt9ad0n7p0dg802,1.0,The employees are great to work with it’s the managers there rude they put a lot of pressure bout sales instead of the animals and petsmart is bout animals not Sales
PetSmart,1dt8rcsla33nu003,3.0,I have a passion for dogs but they have so many rules that it ruined the experience for me. As well as management really wasn’t good. Our boss would come in 4 hours late everyday and then would yell at you for being 10 minutes late. They scheduled me everyday 10 hour shifts except two days a week
PetSmart,1dt7fu8ujf12j801,5.0,"Love PetSmart and miss it.  Quality company with the best and brightest employees. Management cares about the people and the onsite benefits are amazing, child care, gym, cafeteria, Starbucks, etc."
PetSmart,1dt7ftv8lhad1803,5.0,Loved it there it was and always will be a great work environment. I love the staff and the customers. Very friendly people and the best customer service ever they have everything you need for pets
PetSmart,1dt7dg69vp0dg802,5.0,Petsmart was a good place to work I loved the fast paced job the hours were good and the people were very friendly I worked with the process of picking items was not hard at all
PetSmart,1dt6ocqpdhc33802,2.0,"Petsmart will treat you like a factory line. The management may care about you, but the company itself could care less about you or your well being. You are just another money maker."
PetSmart,1dt6bsl0333nu007,1.0,"Management lies, corporate not any help with obvious management problems. Targets older, loyal, responsible and honest employees. Management has it's own agenda, employees not an important part of that agenda"

PetSmart,1dt5ch9tqp0dg803,3.0,"Fine first job or summer job, but when it comes to caring about it’s employees, Petsmart could learn a few things. Hard to move up, a whole lot of favoritism, and good luck trying to get a raise or hours."
PetSmart,1dt54pifu33nu002,1.0,"First, from day one I noticed a lack of training and hours favoring experienced people, never giving new workers appropriate hours to train or pay bills, I asked for 25 hours and was lucky to get 14  so, because I was untrained, I was only ever on cash register  if you want to work with animals try somewhere else  so disappointing and I felt undervalued"
PetSmart,1dt4jkohfo2bu802,2.0,"When I first started, I ADORED working at PetSmart. I started as a cashier and was quickly moved over to pet care. I absolutely adore caring for animals, so being moved to pet care was amazing for me, until I realized how overworked and under-appreciated I was. Managers are extremely childish and pick favorites, and also have no respect for employee availability. Animals aren’t given the proper care and associates aren’t given the proper equipment or training to care for them. An awful and sad place to work."
PetSmart,1dt44n48kq3m9802,1.0,"There wasn't a set schedule, you could get off work at 9pm and have to be back at 3am, customers were meaner and more viscious than their pets. When First learning the register, I was insulted, screamed at, and spit on."
PetSmart,1dt224p7lhc33802,3.0,"I, like many; enjoy caring for animals. So, when I applied to PetSmart for a position as a PetCare Associate, I felt eager to work in an environment where I thought my years of experience would be embraced. I have worked in Pet Retail off and on for many years. At one time, I even owned my own store. I understand that the work can be challenging at times. (Trying to complete as many tasks as possible in a particular timeframe.) However, I truly believe that PetSmart has a false sense of reality when staffing for PetCare. Yes, PetCare is given a higher pay rate than most associates. But, be forewarned, you work for EVERY penny you earn.  In any other company within the pet industry where I have worked, care for animals was the responsibility of everyone in the store. However, it seems that at PetSmart, ALL care is given solely to PetCare Associates. That may sound fair to most. However, along with caring for a multitude of animals and keeping enclosures clean; you answer phones, you are a back up for registers, and of course customer service. The store where I am employed is rather small. And with the experience I have in the industry, I still struggle on a daily basis. I can only imagine the level of stress put on PetCare Associates at larger locations. The location where I am employed claims that we work as a team. However, if a particular task is not completed during your shift, it does not carry over to the next shift.  There is absolutely NO team work.  And then the following day you are chastised for not completing a task. I guess they should hire amoebas that can divide"
PetSmart,1dt20971hq4ms802,2.0,"I started a grooming apprentice hoping to become a full time groomer. My manager was amazing , however the women I had to work with day to day were awful to me. They acted like children and I left crying. I was   a server for years ans have a tough skin . This didn't even compare. I was bullied by older women out of my one dream."
PetSmart,1dt1usmirq4ms803,3.0,Great place to work at. Some of the employees in the grooming salon were difficult to work with and management had very little control over what when on.
PetSmart,1dt0s5tejq4ms803,5.0,"I enjoy working with PetSmart, and the salary is good. I just happen to be relocating and I am looking for something as close to the work and salary that I am accustom to"
PetSmart,1dt0kqi7cq3m9803,4.0,Petsmart could be such an outstanding company if they stopped fake caring . They also show a lot of favoritism towards certain employees .Management  sucks.
PetSmart,1dst5m8mbnh9j800,3.0,Work would be fun if people actually cared and were willing to take care of pets and each other. I left because I was being bullied and management chose not to do anything
PetSmart,1dsrrvutanh9j803,2.0,I was a groomer for about 2 years before quitting. I did not like the pressure they put on you to do 6 or more grooms a day. Non of us groomers ever really took a break and we sometimes didn't take a lunch. For the stress and body pains it was not worth it. Not to mention you work weekends which sucks if you have family and friends who don't. It wasn't all bad. Coworkers are cool and you get to pet dogs
PetSmart,1dsqksmjp33nc002,4.0,"My time at PetSmart was honestly pretty awesome, I was really happy the only issues I had were through the grooming Academy tests, I felt as if I was treated unfairly, another associate passed yet they broke a bigger safety rule than I did, I understand safety is a big priority but it felt unfair"
PetSmart,1dsqk9ub6o2bu803,5.0,PetSmart was a fun place company to work for. We had short breaks but overall I enjoyed my time there. Associates would mostly communicate with pet parents and their animals.
PetSmart,1dspo0k9t33nu003,4.0,We got a new Store Manager how did not like me and he tried everything to get rid of me .After bullying for Weeks I quit .Don't expect help from your District Manager .Otherwise I loved Petsmart .Still sad that it went this Way
PetSmart,1dso824ahhad1802,3.0,"Over all the company is great for pet parents. Very informative and good at problem solving. However, it is a big company and the environment is overwhelming in the retail and customer service aspect."
PetSmart,1dsloogtvq3m9802,3.0,i really enjoy this job and have enjoyed working my way up the ladder. store leadership has been rough but all the other departments are ran well.
PetSmart,1dsl1a2ciq4ms802,1.0,"The management does NOT listen to advice employees give about their animals health. I told my manager that a baby guinea pig had pneumonia, i sent videos of the guinea pig to 3 different guinea breeders whom agreed the baby guinea pig indeed had pneumonia. He told me the guinea pig was fine, the next day the guinea pig was dead. The also had on the label for the mice “Male mice can be together, they can but only before puberty and IF they are from the same litter. I explained this to him yet nothing changed. I was always under extreme pressure and stress every time I work, I was treated as if I were less than dirt. They don’t schedule you within the hours you tell them you can work and theg also don’t schedule you the days you provide. In the 2 months I worked their FIVE employees left because of the management. I was told we are not allowed to tell customers that we do price-match with certain companies because they want the customers to have to pay their inflated prices. My work was strictly being a cashier yet they were understaffed(because of management)yet they would have me stocking and front-facing the ENTIRE STORE! I hated it their because they DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR ANIMALS! I also went into the cat room one night after I had front faced to tell the cats goodnight and give them some attention because volunteers only come twice a day.Well apparently that’s not allowed and I almost got fired for it, they NEVER told me that i couldn’t go in there. Since the cat room key was in the drawer at the register I believed there would be nothing wrong with it. If you actually"
PetSmart,1dsl0f18833nc002,5.0,I stock the shelves at the store with items Petsmart receives from their truck. I ask customers if they need any assistance. I bathe dogs in preparation for them to be groomed.
PetSmart,1dsj3m3j6hc33802,4.0,"As a store manager, I love it. But there was no chance to get promoted any higher. The company would hire someone from outside the company most of the time."
PetSmart,1dsj2ou01q3ma803,2.0,"Co-workers are good, some managers create a negative culture that effects the energy at times. But this all depends on what store and manager you have. Not all petsmarts are equal"

PetSmart,1dsifo983q3ma803,5.0,Really loved working at PetSmart but they  were not able to give me full time after working there in multiple positions for 2 years. Also it was minimum wage and I just wasn’t making enough money. Absolutely loved the job though.

PetSmart,1dse85oafhacm807,3.0,"Working as a pet care associate is a rewarding job and the best parts of my day are taking care of the animals and talking to customers about the animals. There is a large focus on customer service and you are usually expected to learn cashier, stocking, and other tasks outside of your job title. Management was usually poor and does not do a good job of keeping up with inventory and also does a poor job of scheduling while our store has a chronic issue with being severely understaffed. Management expects associates to work like robots despite the fact that animals are unpredictable and customers can take large amounts of time to help. The largest issue with PetSmart and the most difficult part of the job by far is the source of the animals, the breeders, which constantly send sick and dying animals who are doomed to live in cramped bins for up to months until they are healed or die. PetSmart's culture on the other hand was enjoyable, with a diverse array of people from different backgrounds which made the workplace more enjoyable. Some stores are busier than others from what I've heard, but be prepared to juggle many tasks at once while helping customers and learning new things every day and definitely tone on some time management skills!"
PetSmart,1dsdtbp00oafs803,5.0,"You learn new things everyday, especially about animals and products you didn't t know about. The company is very caring and help with things you need."
PetSmart,1dscmem1q4820802,5.0,Great job to earn good money and have fun. Flexible part time hours and management was nice and caring. I would recommend working at Petsmart to learn customer skills.
PetSmart,1dsbobmg8hacm802,2.0,Worked as a pet stylist appreciate aka a bather. You start at 9/ hr including tips. The training is all on computers and kind of silly because everything is hands on with the actual job. Dealing with the animals is very stressful and you’re prone to getting bitten or attacked if you don’t handle them correctly. Sometimes they push you to groom a possible vicious dog  even if you’re not comfortable. In the end the fear I had of getting attacked and the terrible hours and pay led to me quitting. This job made me start to dislike animals and that wasn’t a good feeling.
PetSmart,1dsbf9qp9h3kk801,2.0,It was a different atmosphere to work at but I loved seeing the animals and watching them grow up. I didn't agree with the pushing of the puppy kit and training.
PetSmart,1dsb4b17knre9802,3.0,"Company has ways to move up the corporate ladder and rewards hard working employees. They do require a lot out of each employee, but hard work does not go unnoticed."
PetSmart,1dsabd1aoh40j803,4.0,"Although it has been several years since I've worked here, this is still my favorite of all the jobs I've had. Everyone has their gripes with work, but this was one job where the only reason I would not go in was if I was legitimately ill. Even on a bad day, you got to pet some dogs and cats!"
PetSmart,1ds8u53175n9i800,5.0,"Petsmart was the best job I have ever had. My managers and coworkers were amazing. Being a cashier wasn't as exciting as working in the grooming salon because it wasn't as busy but it was still a good time. Most of the customers were regulars and were excellent. If you are nice to them and make their trip there a good time, then they will come back. I learned alot working there. Alot of the patience came from the grooming salon. Very busy paced in the salon but that's how I like it. I felt that being able to help pet parents find the perfect products just made me warm and fuzzy inside."
PetSmart,1ds8mmt5inre9801,1.0,"When I worked at PetSmart, my coworkers would consistently gossip about customers and other coworkers when they weren't around. While my more senior coworkers were allowed to do as they desired (listen to music while bathing a dog, leaving dogs on the table while taking calls, refusing to take calls altogether), I, as a new employee, was thrown under the bus for it. There were a few good apples in the place, but for the most part, I wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible."
PetSmart,1ds8lpm22otsj800,5.0,I really like petsmart. It was such a great experience working with animals and getting to know them a little by little every week they come back for their grooming appointments.

PetSmart,1ds6e3dtmhakq802,5.0,Petsmart is caring not only to staff but customers and their pets. Pets are usually greeted first. All customers are welcomed and asked if they need assistance.
PetSmart,1ds2nkptqno8q802,4.0,I enjoyed working at this job but I do wish that they would have offered to give me cross-training in other areas. The crew we had at the time were all younger than me but they were an awesome group of kids and took pride in what they were doing. Honestly I miss them all. But unfortunately I things must change.
PetSmart,1ds0bvs9n5nci802,2.0,"At my store, the store manager (paid salary) leaves an hour early almost every day. He plays favoritism, disciplines the good workers, and lets the bad workers get away with everything. He is constantly saying one thing, then turning around and saying or doing something that contradicts his prior decision. He never takes blame for his actions, instead, throwing the blame onto someone else, including but not limited to: selling animals for inappropriate habitats, voiding guarantees for animals instead of outright denying them, telling customers that the grooming salon is open later than they are, etc. I don't feel comfortable talking to him about ANYTHING, however, I also don't feel comfortable going to the District Manager about him. Besides the store manager, the pay isn't great. I'm working almost 40 hours a week and barely bring home $280 a week. If you are full time, you never have a weekend day off unless you are the store manager or pet trainer. You're expected to do 5 different things at once. If something doesn't get done, you will be blamed, no matter what. While the atmosphere and most of the employees are great, the pay, being the scapegoat, and feeling of unimportance isn't worth it."
PetSmart,1ds06fdrt5j4g800,4.0,"Sometimes I enjoy my job. I love working with all the animals and learning new things about them but the people aren’t the best. I work well with customers but sometimes they don’t want to listen to what I have to say. I do my best to give them the correct advice to care for their animals but they don’t want to listen, especially if it involves spending more money."

Things change constantly, as retail always does, but there are no immediate penalties for not getting things done.  Most enjoyable part of the day is dealing with the animals, of course, and actually the PetParents are pretty great to.  Hardest part of the job is probably dealing with associates not being on time and upholding their work standards."
PetSmart,1drrcidak5n8i800,1.0,Unrealistic expectations coupled with ornery regional managers and stubborn/angry store managers lead to a very bad place to work. The managers would not listen to reason even when you definitely knew better. You got treated like you were dumb for asking questions.
PetSmart,1drr63896b84l802,4.0,I enjoyed being here. It was a wonderful place to work and grow. It provides a variety of fields to work in. It gave me a sense of home. Pets came first for PetSmart and I loved that.

PetSmart,1dro7n8lk24f8003,5.0,This job was a very good fit for me because it was filled with dogs and some cats. You will never have a moment of down time but that makes the shift go by faster. You will be a part of a big family in the salon.
PetSmart,1drmmvqao24g9001,4.0,"The people i worked with plus the customers that came in, made it easier to have a good attitude when clocking into my shift. Management was always easy to talk to and open to questions. They never gave me something that i couldn't handle and if i couldn't do it alone there was always a helping hand nearby."
PetSmart,1drmen67j24fp004,5.0,Working in the hotel has been so enjoyable I couldn't leave. It is now my second job and it's the best! Managment is top notch and some of the friendliest people around. Cashier is also really fun and the shifts fly by. The store manager is amazing as well and really cares about the employees. Over all working at petsmart has been a blast. A huge shout out to all the managers and leaders for being so wonderful.
PetSmart,1drm1m4im24gp003,3.0,honestly the company is fine we can have fun as a team but with how petsmart is with the mostly only part timers its hard to move up in the system. I'd love to work full time and receive benefits but I never get the chance.
PetSmart,1drkah53lf090802,1.0,"Gave this company years of my life, worked a few different positions and locations and even at the corporate office only to realize that I was completely replaceable. I was taught and given the duties of the next promotion I was in order for, but never given the final walk to promote me and give me the pay raise I deserved. I was cussed at by management, shamed for taking sick time that I had PTO to cover, PTO I had earned. The best thing I got from this company was the title to be able to add to my resume."
PetSmart,1drjre5n0hben801,5.0,I love what the hydrosurge has done to help the efficiency of bathing and conservation of products and waste. I love Petsmart and their core values and procedures for safety prevention. And of course the stores with Banfield available.
PetSmart,1drisgk3eoueo802,2.0,"Ever since the new investment group purchased PetSmart, all they do is take away as much as possible. I've only been here 2.5 years but many drastic, yet unnecessary, changes have already been made. It is really a shame because barring the drama, it's not a very hard job. However, it is very difficult to succeed when there is rarely any help from management."
PetSmart,1drgei0tt24g8003,1.0,"PetSmart only cares about profit. Even though products and services most often sell themselves, employees will be written up and potentially terminated for not meeting unreachable sales goals. This goes for any location, even if they are the number one store in the district. PetSmart cuts labor at any opportunity with no care for employees' need to provide for themselves and others."
PetSmart,1drfjr3o724e8003,5.0,Enjoyed every aspect working for this company. The store lacked inventory but still offered plenty of services for customers. Animals were taken care of quickly and with out hesitation. The staff kept the store clean and organized. Wonderful experience.
PetSmart,1drfgaefi24e8002,5.0,PetSmart has a great enviornment and the 3/4 day schedules allow for life/work balance. Advancement opportunities and a culture of diversity and inclusion make this a great place to work!!
PetSmart,1dreld53d24e8002,4.0,"I only left because I was pregnant and later moved before I could return to work but I loved the establishment, crew and goals. Management we respectful and understanding. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to do work with animals and perhaps the most unexciting was stocking."
PetSmart,1drei7q9324go003,2.0,"lack of teamwork and rough behavior with animals. I did enjoy interacting with the animals, I just didn't like how they were treated by other groomers and bathers. easily overbooked and rushed on a daily basis"
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1drecfaf424eo004,5.0,Come in to work work at your own pace fun environment on time pay raises and holiday pay it's a good paying job n I have a good team with me n we get the job done
PetSmart,1drcu3l6d0mt9002,5.0,Everyday I went to work I did not feel as though i was truly working. I enjoyed working with animals and the people at the work place. The hours worked well with what I was needing at that time.
PetSmart,1drbm3s1q24f7002,5.0,Working for petsmart was the best learning experience and best team I’ve ever worked for and with. Learned a lot about retail and how to build customer/associate relationships. Very knowledgeable about animal care since working for them.
PetSmart,1dra57kgrhbe0801,5.0,I luv the people I work with.  They are all younger than myself.  I'm the oldest person in my store! We truly love animals. My manager is understanding but gets things done.
PetSmart,1dr9mhblk0kbm003,1.0,"the first time i started working there i loved every moment of it, after i got promoted and started working more and more, i noticed that the managers would not care about their employees. every time an employee under my leadership had a concern i tried my best to help them out. the managers would never help out, and would scold me for doing my job as a leader. I've seen more people come and go from this store more than any other job I've ever had. employees would create problems for each other for no reason. management would never listen to your concerns, also they would give appreciation to employees that do not commit to company standards. Managers would treat me badly, never trained me the correct way, neither ever helped me succeed in advancing or help me in my struggles. I would not recommend anyone to work there. it's a disgrace to the company. I bet the founder or the company would be sad how PetsMart went from family and pet values to not caring about their employees and just making profit. DO NOT WORK HERE!!"
PetSmart,1dr9c6o0d24el003,5.0,Each day is never the same except when it comes to making sure all animals are taken care of. Other than that there is always something new to learn and do in your store.
PetSmart,1dr996uci24el000,4.0,Working at pet-smart you gain a lot of knowledge with the health and safety of animals. You excel in customer service and learn new things everyday. The environment is friendly and open to anyone who is passionate with working with animals
PetSmart,1dr97kngf1fdn003,4.0,Helping others and being respectful to help others in the morning and I will be in the area on the pets and keep it up and  if they need help with the pets
PetSmart,1dr96j4k70jgo002,5.0,"The management became my family. I respected them but left to early to become part of them. The saw us as people who had real life situations going on and did not use it against us. I was a single mom of two, my family at PetSmart gave me a chance. I did not fail them."
PetSmart,1dr93r34424f4002,3.0,"If you love animals or wanna know more about them, then apply. Pretty chill environment. Gets busy occasionally but nothing crazy. It’s like any other job"
PetSmart,1dr8jt31624el003,5.0,"PetsMart is the only place I've ever worked for that made me feel like real family. If possible, I would have stayed there all night because I absolutely loved what I did and loved and adored the pets. If I had the chance I would do it all over again. Thanks and God bless."
PetSmart,1dr7i34ch0kbi003,3.0,This no longer applies as once my case was investigated the Operation Manager and the Store Manager were both terminated. I absolutely loved Petsmart with my whole heart. It took 1 dirty manager to destroy my job. I had no back up because I was not a manger. I complained of the ops manager coming to work drunk and no one listened. Well now years later I often see her on arrest reports. She’s had 2 DUI’s this year alone. I find solace in the fact I was right. The company could be great if they actually investigated complaints. Trusting in your team is important. They failed by only trusting in management which they eventually saw was corrupt.
PetSmart,1dr75tgua24e2002,4.0,I loved this company it was good and a respectable place ever one that works there are respectful and great job that’s why I love big place to work meet new people
PetSmart,1dr6mek2h24gi001,3.0,"My overall experience was wonderful. Loved my coworkers and learned a lot about my future preferred field. Unfortunately, life was in the way and I had to leave due to management not being able to work with my issues."

PetSmart,1dr4c19ai24e2002,4.0,I enjoyed my job but had to leave due to moving back to Missouri. I was able to advance and was given a raise in salary quickly. I enjoyed working with the public.
PetSmart,1dr48f68124g2001,4.0,"Petsmart is a cool place to work! I would recommend working here if you love pets and you enjoy working with awesome people! If you work hard, you can always move up in your position."
PetSmart,1dr3te5hi24g2002,3.0,I was able to gain a lot of knowledge and experience from this job. For the most part it was fun to help customers take care of their pets. You have to be on your feet a lot and have a good amount of strength for this job. They give you the opportunity to work in other parts of the store as well.
PetSmart,1dr2qkjk3h3io803,3.0,the work day sucks i didnt learn anything management sucks workplace culture sucks the hardest part of the job is that it sucked and nothing was enjoyable thanks

PetSmart,1dr1fiukgh3qo803,1.0,"I was told that I was fired for stealing grooming services. I was the salon manager and the dog's groomer, it was my own dog that I groomed on the clock and I used my discount to pay for it. Tell me, how is that stealing? If your store manager doesn't like you, they will find a way to get rid of you, whether it's a legitimate reason or not. I had worked for PetSmart for 12 years and they fired me for a fabrication. Shame on this company"
PetSmart,1dquacapj5naa803,5.0,"Greet customers, check in dog , sell grooming packages , make appointments, answer telephone, bath dog , dry dog with force dryer , groom dog , clean kennels , clean work station , clean your grooming tools , help out other employees (work as a team)."
PetSmart,1dqu67tq2h3ul803,3.0,"It was a job, not much more than that, the best part about  it was being able to play with dogs. Coworkers were fun to talk to but I wouldn't really say they were good at their jobs, a few exceptions. Management was difficult to work with, they pretty much just sit on the cashier, do some computer work and then sit and not help out with cleaning or anything like that, even if we were busy in the back and they didn't have anything to do in the front"
PetSmart,1dqstjm0ah3qo803,3.0,"Honestly, I do like my job, but I'm tired of it. I have been there for 15 years and want to try something new. I love learning new things as well and improve on this skills I have"
PetSmart,1dqs5mrca52uj803,1.0,I worked with Petsmart for 18yrs. Always felt as tho my job threatened on a weekly basis. Never a happy place to work. No one would own up to there mistakes or misleading info. Had mover around to different stores just to leave the horrible management. Then they sold to new owners who got rid of anyone who had been there for years to make it cheaper on them to line there pocket. .
PetSmart,1dqs2hbva1d0n002,3.0,Petsmart is a great place to find the needs that suite your pet! they offer just about everything you can think of and pet care is the number one priority
PetSmart,1dqpvvbn9h3io802,3.0,"Been with PetSmart for almost a year now. Your experience will definitely depend on your store. Some PetSmarts are thriving and others are going down the drain. Being a Bather is a difficult job. You're responsible for lots of things and sometimes treated like less since you're not a groomer. If you love animals, you'll be fine."
PetSmart,1dqptr8i6b8br803,1.0,"HR supports managers over associates, allows retaliation and forces resignations. Store management is awful, favoritism is rampant. Constantly will insist on work outside job description and not compensate. Not promote from within those who are qualified, rather those with no experience."
PetSmart,1dqpkluhgh3n5801,5.0,I loved working here I would love to work here and either be shift leader or manager this was the best job I ever had I miss working here and want to go back
PetSmart,1dqmh03qlh3ii802,5.0,Everyone at PetSmart makes customer and animals the first priority. The animal habitats are kept clean. They take excellent care of the animals and fish. I loved my time at PetSmart. I also worked at one in Sacramento CA. I loved it so much I transferred here.
PetSmart,1dqlrlfb6b8bn802,3.0,"Checked in and out dogs, cut nails, bathed and brushed dogs. Made appointments in person and via phone. Printed invoices and updated or created accounts for customers. Handled tip money for myself and others."
PetSmart,1dqkdpttbh42h805,3.0,"Low pay, Bad hours. Management is so focused on bonuses set un achievable goals. False promises made by DM about advancement to keep employees. Needs 150 characters to know its a poor job."
PetSmart,1dqkb04jbbrfl802,4.0,"I worked in PetSmart for about a year,and really is a great job and good employee's,I was taught thurally on my job and what was expected of me to finish"
PetSmart,1dqk0qcmrh42h802,1.0,"Don't even consider calling HR unless you want to be fired. Management is awful! They are unsupportive especially in the grooming salon. They will say they are the only management on the floor and next time they are paged they won't come in, even if there is another manager out on the floor. The grooming salon is a hostile environment. There is drama with the co-workers. My store manager was aggressive and hostile. She would threaten and blame us for when business got slow. She yelled in my face and slammed her hand on a counter in front of me for something another groomer did. I called HR and care line. They talked to the DM and she didn't even ask me about the situation instead they fired me the second they found out I was looking for a new job. They called up the grooming salon I wasn't even sure I wanted and they new the location because foolish me I trusted a coworker in the salon and she went straight to management. I still had plenty of time to put in a 2 weeks notice but I wasn't even sure if I wanted to quit petsmart because of my health insurance. (they expect their former groomers to never groom again which is unreal. The new salon I was looking into was 10 miles away which is there competitive requirement). Well the DM made my decision for me. I had been there for 8 years and had the top productivity and sales in the grooming salon. Petsmart says they don't tolerate bullying, harassment, or retaliation but that is exactly what management do! It's sad when you can't even depend on your HR. Never call care line you WILL loose your job! All it accomplishes is angering"
PetSmart,1dqip9k9vh42h802,1.0,"My experience with petsmart was extremely horrible due to the discrimination that I faced. I was held back professionally due to management only promoting their own kind and I’vei tried to take a stand my hours were shortened and then when I decided to take my leave, fired"
PetSmart,1dqijfuo25j5t803,4.0,"PetSmart was by far my favorite job I've had yet, my dream always was to take care of animals so I absolutely adored the time I spent there. The problem was having a manager who would misgender me daily, and did it the entire time I was there, despite other staff and customers alike calling me the correct pronouns. Even the customers would ask why she would do it. She was known to misgender all previous trans employees as well apparently. She also, despite being the pet care manager, was never in pet care. I don't think I had ever once seen her actually working in petcare. She didn't even know what food we fed the doves. She was also the reason over half our staff had tried to quit at various points throughout their time at petsmart. Either way, I and the maybe 2 other capable petcare employees had to pick up on her slack an do her job for her. I quit due to the lack of training for petcare which led to mistreatment of the animals, and no matter how hard i tried to make sure these animals got what they needed they were always underfed, dehydrated, or dying. As I left, apparently every Syrian hamster in the store died due to a bad shipment. I had already dealt with the deaths of multiple hamsters, and they refused to allow me to head home early despite the fact I had spent the majority of the shift sobbing and unable to hold myself together. And I know there are policies in place that say they have to allow employees to go home early if they are unable to emotionally handle the deaths of the animals under our care. Between her, the endless scheduling issues that the other manager"
PetSmart,1dqhp9vg8h3mv803,5.0,Amazing pets  fun to work there  good co workers. I loved meeting new pets and building relationships with customers and pets.  I was excited to see the regular customers each week.
PetSmart,1dqhocl0452uc802,5.0,Petsmart is a great place to work and a very welcoming environment. It’s great to be able to connect with pet parents and my coworkers while helping animals.

PetSmart,1dqdubf93h3ua802,2.0,"The particular store that I worked at had terrible management. I worked in the salon. Everyday that our salon should have been enjoying our work day, it seemed as if we were wishing we were some place else grooming. New groomers did not get the training and one on one time that they deserved and experienced groomers within that company were highly under appreciated. My particular manager was never there to guide us and was always doing ""paper work"" in office while our seasoned groomers were trying to groom their dogs and teach the newer groomers how to properly groom. Busy or not busy, it was always our fault that we did not have enough dogs to groom on a day to day basis and they would let us know! Rewards were not as abundant as getting negative comments."
PetSmart,1dqdjses8h42c802,1.0,"I worked for PetSmart for many years, worked my way up into management. Had full availability but soon came to realize the management team didn't support themselves and were incapable of taking care of their staff. My team of managers would say horrible things about the staff, as well as other managers behind their backs. Communication was always lacking."
PetSmart,1dqdc9408h3ua801,5.0,Benefits were very minimal. Pay was capped after a certain amount.  Pay not enough for tasks done. The culture in the other hand is great and if you are looking for a fin part time job this is it!
PetSmart,1dqdc3k6gh42c801,5.0,Petsmart is a great place to work. They work really hard to make you feel included in everything there. The workplace is fun while still getting the job done!
PetSmart,1dqd9oetmh3mq803,3.0,The most enjoyable part about working in the salon is my ability to interact with the dogs and the pet parents when their dog's service is complete. It's always nice seeing people's faces whenever I give their fresh and good-smelling dog back to them.
PetSmart,1dqd36ikrbrfb803,5.0,Na na na na na I love it there so much friendly people and loved the animals and people and the experience of working there would go back any time I enjoyed it
PetSmart,1dqb445e4h42c803,1.0,I worked in the salon and they would regularly take animals without rabies vaccines. The store manager knew and did nothing to resolve the issue. It was unsafe in there so I asked to be transferred to a different location in the store.
PetSmart,1dqb1voil5n9t802,4.0,"Seen people get fired for ""not being approachable""; if you love animals do not work here. Advancement is all political and raises are very minimal. Not a great place to work long term."

PetSmart,1dqa85rlgh3id803,3.0,"You have the opportunity to work with good people, but it is hindered by Senior Leaderships lack of connection to the staff or understanding of what they want.  Compensation is fair for the expected duties."
PetSmart,1dq9smmjgh3qc801,2.0,"Dont get me wrong i loved petsmart but it was horrible managers where not on top of what was going on and continue to blame everyone but themselves not only that bather are in charge or there own area but when others are behind then must drop what there doing to shower there coworker dog then continue to work on their own some groomers help when bathers are behind but its not a requirement compared to the other way around,"
PetSmart,1dq4q3r2obrfb803,2.0,"I worked at PetSmart in two different towns. I first worked at PetSmart in Rolla, MO. The majority of co-workers were hard working and team players. The General Manager was great to work for. I had a few issues with not getting paid for some hours, which was corrected the following week. After getting certified to work in PetCare, I was still being scheduled for cashier although several other people were hired for PetCare including one young man that worked in PetCare for 3 weeks without being certified while I was certified but scheduled as cashier. I do not blame the General Manager. Again he was a great person to work for."
PetSmart,1dq3pi8ogh429801,3.0,"I was brought in and trained to be a groomer. And all was fine for my first year with the company. The management however was too concerned with themselves, do not stick up for their employees. And i was ready to leave come year two. The company is fine but after making complaints to corporate about said management they did nothing."
PetSmart,1dq3p9ie9h3mn802,2.0,"Job is ok, training is ok, mediocre communication.  No breaks, only lunch breaks, inconsistent hours, drama, high turnover.  Best part is the pets, & most customers."
PetSmart,1dq34fqkrh3q8802,4.0,"Just a warning to this job, don't be one of those people that lie, only work at a pet store if you actually like animals! All animals and aren't afraid to hold lizards, birds and such like."
PetSmart,1dq2put0bh467804,1.0,This is the worst place I have ever worked in my life.  The only good part was getting to pet the customer's dogs - and the day I walked out the door.  Run like your hair is on fire.
PetSmart,1dq2gjatmbrf8800,1.0,"If you work at Petsmart and notice someone isn’t doing their job then keep it to yourself. There is an open door policy but they do not enforce it. Petsmart has a clique, and they will try and go after you with everything they got, it would be ok to deal with except 2 of the clique members are managers. They will pin things on you, blame you for mistakes, belittle you, undermine you, and create conflict with you outside of work, stand around in groups talking about you then when you go over they disperse, consistently glare at you and ignore you. If it wasn’t for the people working there Petsmart would be a great place to work, but unfortunately that’s not the case. You usually are told you can take your breaks but then when you ask they say not right now and then when the time comes around for you to take your break it’s to late. So usually you just get a lunch unless you really annoy them for your breaks and then you have to hear them complain about how your putting them in a bind.  If you love animals don’t work here, I can’t say anything else but that. You are allowed to say no to the sale of animals but if you do that here you get treated poorly because they are all about sales. Lastly most of the manager are to overwhelmed and stressed out to even do a good job at work, but they all think they are gods. Petsmart is just an awful place to work at and if you want to keep your mental stableness then I suggest you stay far far away."
PetSmart,1dq1jo1b9h3mn802,1.0,Company is driven on puppy guides and sales. if you don't meet the quota the you will be written up. Its not about the customer anymore its about numbers which is very sad.

PetSmart,1dq0416sb5j5g802,3.0,Terrible management and high turnover. It was great seeing all sorts of animals all day but there is not much room to grow. It is boring as you are mostly standing once you have completed your tasks. Easy job but boring and the management does not care about their employees.
PetSmart,1dpvv8eesh3i7802,1.0,They lie to pet parents. Dogs are not well cared for and are not kept as safe as they should be. Employees and dogs are at risk. They treat the employees like trash and it is not right. I would not take my dog there or work for them ever again or tell anyone else to. I wish I could tell all the pet parents what really goes on in the hotel. Some of them have really great dogs that deserve so much better. The pet parents also deserve to know that their dogs don’t always get what they pay for. Play times or camp times just get cut short or completely skipped when we are short staffed and yet the pet parents still pay and aren’t told. It’s wrong and I’m so sorry for ever working for them.
PetSmart,1dpvoq3jbh3mg802,2.0,You will be told continuously that you’re gonna get promoted or move up to a higher position. It never happens or they do the bare minimum to make you stop asking
PetSmart,1dpu917ga5j5g802,3.0,"it was a great job to go to school and not have any responsibilities other than that you will not survive in the real world, not many hours they do not pay much and if you advance to be a low end manager witch is very hard to do you will get pay almost 11 witch sucks because others pays more than that"
PetSmart,1dpu6t957h426802,5.0,"I worked at this location for under a year and they quickly became my best friends. I felt respected, important, and part of the team. The animals were treated with the best respect, we were all there because we loved animals. You don't need much experience to work there, but you need to be willing to learn how to do the job properly. The only downside I ever had was when people would come in for the job and not really care about the work we were doing. I would have stayed there for much longer if I didn't have to move away. I was a cashier for the first month and was promoted to Pet Care Leader after that (due to the position being recently opened and the most appropriate person for the job was leaving and the others were only part timers, so I was fortunate) but it is pretty easy to move up in this business as long as you do your job. This was my most favorite job to be honest. Not only because I got to work with animals on the daily, but I met some of the best people. If you have the chance to work here, do it."
PetSmart,1dptoqs4lbrf1802,3.0,"The working culture of Petsmart is dedicated to customer service and care of a myriad of pets with a focus on dogs and cats. I felt very welcomed at first but as time wore on, the hours and opportunity for advancement seemed to disappear. I mean at first I was told I would get at least 35 hours a week so paying my bills would be satisfied but the longer I've worked there the less hours I am being given. I was also told that I have an chance to go to grooming school but nothing ever materialized. I feel like I got baited with a non existent chance for advancement."
PetSmart,1dptgn13i5ndh802,4.0,"It is a great space to work, the customers and staff are awesome. However, sometimes it's alot for one person to cover the front if others are not available to help and pay is horrible."
PetSmart,1dpsv6t3e5j5g802,1.0,Some of the Management teams don't know what they are doing. H.R don't keep your confidential private when talking to them or uppers management.  I was excited until I found out that it was not for me.
PetSmart,1dps72ipih426802,4.0,"i absolutely love working here at petsmart, fun place to work, great group of people to work with, everyone works with everyone, no one leaves anyone behind and if your willing to learn something new, petsmart is a great place to work."
PetSmart,1dpreoinvh3i7802,4.0,"PetSmart is a corporation. Money comes first. When you work with the animals that are in their care, that can be frustrating. However, at this store, the animals are taken care of very well because our associates really care. Of course there were some flaky employees who didn’t last long, and the few of us who have stayed. The store leader doesn’t know a lot about pet care, but the ASL is pretty cool  Of course bosses can be annoying but if you are not in pet care the job is pretty easy going  Pet care is all multitasking and stress, but if you love animals it’s worth it (sometimes). It’s also nice to know you can make sure these animals go to good homes."
PetSmart,1dpqbr4r3h3i7800,5.0,"The most I can say about my time at petsmart as you were respected. Now you must know your stuff, such as which dog food for which and it can be a ver hard task take to learn all the foods. But the managers are there to hep. I loved the people I worked with, we ere the embodiment of a team."
PetSmart,1dppiu0ugb8ba800,1.0,I love working with animals and my fellow associates. Management however is incredibly unproductive and scattered. There are too many managers and ‘associates leads’ and communication between them is non existent. Communication between departments is poor as well which leads to many issues with customers. Management fails to staff  to meet the needs of the store and  doubles your work load to compensate for the lack of staffing rather  than take responsibility.
PetSmart,1dpoq56roh426802,2.0,It's very very stressful they just see you as a sollar sign not a person training is quick and not long enough they pay you barely above minimum wage and expect you to give them your life
PetSmart,1dpoirp805ndh802,5.0,PetSmart was a great experience for me I really like working with the different animals and making sure the work area was good for the customers I really like meeting the customers that came in it was a really fun experience for me.
PetSmart,1dpm7lmsi5n9i804,2.0,"When you work fr PetSmart, there are good things you get to do. Connecting with pet parents through pet and product knowledge is very rewarding, and having regular customers that treat you right is awesome. That said, management across the company is not very good, the company doesn’t seem to really care about its employees and it’s quite blatant when you work there, and many stores suffer from the selfish decisions that corporate makes."
PetSmart,1dpm274sdbrf1800,4.0,"faced paced with answering phones, greeting and checking in customers in between grooming dogs. fun environment with coworkers and dogs.  can get pretty loud."
PetSmart,1dpll3ek5h3mg802,5.0,I love working here! It is a lovely environment with great people to work with! My biggest passion is working with animals and I get to explore that while working here!
PetSmart,1dplak0dtb83u802,3.0,"It was fun at first, but after a while it seems like everyone cares much less about you. This includes management, coworkers, HR, and even the people you don't really see that often."
PetSmart,1dpk4o9tnh3q2800,5.0,"I've worked for PetSmart over 6 years and would definitely recommend them. I love what I do, I love my team, and I love the company. There's a feeling of family, and the fact that everyone you work with loves animals makes it even better. We are all doing what we love. Great environment, great opportunities to grow with the company, benefits, very good company."
PetSmart,1dpj51gr95n9f800,5.0,I worked as a volunteer intern for a little while in PetSmart. Although I did not get paid I enjoyed helping the animals and presenting them to potential adopting families.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1dpj18ochb83p800,5.0,I would love to go back!! I was a dog bather and loved it. You could get tips if you got really good at what you do. Most of the people you work with are lots of fun and will always givr you a hand if needed
PetSmart,1dpitrqc2h423800,1.0,The stores are setup to reward people that are in good with the DM and will ignore policies and procedures if it benefits the bottom line numbers. Nothing can be said to leaders about issues without backlash.
PetSmart,1dpis6kqih3i3802,5.0,"Its okay just don't expect to much. You work at your own pace, either way they don't really care as long as you show up. I work hard but its not a requirement at all."
PetSmart,1dphajecibreu801,2.0,"They expect alot from you, this is not at all a laid back job, and you might not get trained fully. Training takes longer the most places too, alot of tests and videos, along with exercises in the training book they provide."
PetSmart,1dph185afbreu800,3.0,"Too much information to learn and too many responsibilities for minimum wage pay. Petcare and cashiers have the hardest job positions, stocker position is the easiest but only if you are not lazy."
PetSmart,1dph0dkj3h3md804,5.0,Great place to work love the energy and environment. Managers always ask if you are good and comfortable at what you are doing. Fun place to work come across beautiful animals
PetSmart,1dpgogdnv5j5c800,3.0,"A typical day of work starts with the sanitization of habitats, ornaments, etc. Feeding and watering of animals. Medicating of animals. Scrubbing of tanks. Keeping the place clean."
PetSmart,1dpgnk7m9h3md802,5.0,"Working at Petsmart was a wonderful experience that I would gladly take on again. Day to day work was fun and I was always excited to see I was on schedule, coming in with a happy face and ready to work. The hardest part would be some of the heavier or more aggressive animals, but coworkers were happy to lend a hand getting a stubborn or large dog onto the table, or calming an animal they knew was troublesome."
PetSmart,1dpglhoavb83p802,3.0,"I worked at PetSmart while being a full time student. They would work around my school schedule, but would always call me during class to see if I could cover people all the time, even though I told them many times that I had class those days. The people working there were crazy and insane. Alright first time job, but definitely wouldn't recommend working there full time."
PetSmart,1dpg35ht1h3i3802,4.0,Metting new and exciting faces everyday. Making the customer my number one priority to keep them happy with the company's service also mine. Striving to make every day better than the last.
PetSmart,1dpe490bdh3tn802,1.0,This job is for children. If you’re an adult don’t expect to get paid well or treated with any respect. Raises and benefits there are an absolute joke. You’re stupid if you’re 30+ years old and still working there. Do yourself a favor and get yourself a real job.That is all.
PetSmart,1dpe1n77sh3pn805,1.0,They change your hours based on whom your friends with. Always end up being bullied or only one person doing all the cleaning  the lack of care for animals in the back room is disgraceful. And if you tell management nothing gets done
PetSmart,1dpc78d9bh3tn802,1.0,"The managers at my location seemed far more interested in squabbling with one another than actually getting any work done.  I also felt that they did not value me as an employee, and too often they ask employees to do more work than they can reasonably handle.  I was frequently overbooked in the salon, and I was usually not allowed to block off spots for when I got scheduled too many big or difficult dogs.  When I worked in the PetsHotel I got forced into a 17 hour shift when the overnight cleaner did not show up, against protocol which states that I should've only had to do half of that shift.  I couldn't take a lunch break, either, as I was the only employee in the store, and I hadn't gotten any breaks so far that day, so I hadn't eaten since before I left for work.  After leaving at 6am they still expected me to come in that afternoon for another scheduled shift, which I told them I would NOT be doing, and they were upset with me.  I can count on one hand the number of times I got my scheduled lunch break in the two months I worked at the hotel, and things were only slightly better in the grooming salon.  15 minute breaks don't even exist.  They are HIDEOUSLY understaffed, the turnover rate is extremely high, and the hotel has maybe 30% of the staff it needs to run comfortably at the volume that it does.  Their idea of employee appreciation is allowing us to wear sports jerseys to work a couple of times a year and sometimes buying us cheap ice cream cups from the grocery store.  I felt that I should have been a valuable employee, since I was the only one trained and certified"
PetSmart,1dpb5ti2kbreg802,3.0,Employees not held to the same level.  Management stayed in the office on their personal phones on personal calls 90% of their shift.  Employees constantly no call no show and still had their jobs.  Always had to pick up others job duties because management was very hard on a few and over lenient on most.  Customers were great.
PetSmart,1dp78o7r75n93804,1.0,"No hours for employees, always blamed for not getting tasks done with little hours given. Many animals were not taken care of properly and no follow ups were issued to fix small animal deaths that ensued. Managers were very toxic in their demeanor as well talking down or belittling employees through various scenarios that life could bring up. Did not care about some employees mental states and some mental abuse occurred between a manager and employee as well. Also the higher up managers would take credit for work done around the store and not refer the people who did exceptional work properly. In closing, very lazy management, not enough hours or pay for cost of living (during my final weeks I was averaging $100 a week instead of the $600 I was when I first started), and  some signs of verbal/mental abuse if jobs were not done correctly."
PetSmart,1dp6h8e9rh3m3801,4.0,Working at the Pet Hotel is a great starting part time job for any teen or early college student. The job can be really fun at times because of the various dogs you meet and play with. All my coworkers are very friendly and my manager is very understanding. However not much important life skills are gained from working here and after a while you might get tired of enduring long shifts spending time cleaning after dog droppings and dealing with misbehaving dogs.
PetSmart,1dp4oobvi52te802,4.0,"It had its ups and downs but overall I enjoyed my time with the company, and given the opportunity to work there again, I just might. Work was simple but sometimes taxing (specifically in reference to the grooming salon. I didn't work on the floor.). Management was good for the most part. I didn't engage with too many team leasers other than my SL."
PetSmart,1dp49581ih3pn802,4.0,"A typical day at PetSmart would consist of me feeding and taking care of the animals, cleaning the animal habitats and helping customers. Sometimes I would help with backup at the register."
PetSmart,1dp45ot40b8al802,4.0,I enjoyed interacting with customers and their pets. Cashiering is simple and easy. Everyone is nice and friendly. Talking with pet parents about their pets is my favortie as well as meeting their pets!
PetSmart,1dp2v8i1hh3pn802,3.0,"Working here is pretty fun don’t get me wrong but wanting to have holiday vacations, this job won’t allow you due to black out dates. Also if you have a manger like mine you get bad people who work with you and are unreliable. For this reason is why they call me in ALOT to cover shifts or do jobs that are not even in my title. But if you just do one minor thing they get mad at you. But you can be late everyday and not show up and you will be okay"
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1dp263uhlb86v802,4.0,Great place to learn about and work with animals.  They will teach you everything you want to learn.  Helping customers with their pets was an extremely rewarding experience.
PetSmart,1dp1qjj4hh3ho802,4.0,It's a fun environment to work in. Love working with the animals and educating customers on their new pets. Management is nice and easy to talk to. Store is always clean and the employees are friendly.
PetSmart,1dp1dc8l75j53802,1.0,"This is a HORRIBLE place to work, the managers are ALL CHILDISH, they show favoritism, they don’t acknowledge your hard work, they expect you to do things way out of your position, they cut your hours even more when you don’t get enough hours, they complain about giving you more hours but they give the full timers double the hours, there’s no respect. I advise NO ONE to apply to Petsmart, especially the one in Pelham."
PetSmart,1dp130qqdh3ho803,5.0,"I really enjoyed working at Petsmart because I really love animals. I am extremely organized and like to keep busy, so when I wasn't washing dogs, I stayed on top of cleaning and organization. It was very nice."
PetSmart,1dp0jdcbdh3ho802,3.0,The management needs some work but other than that I loved the job the employees weren't half bad. The pay wasn’t good so I couldn’t afford to stay there so I had to relocate.
PetSmart,1dp0dgldsh41o80a,5.0,This is tge most amazing job I've ever worked at! I love it an never want to leave. It would just be nice if they were willing to pay the part time employees a more livable wage for the work they do.
PetSmart,1dovj59ul5j53802,2.0,It was stressful all the time. No one did their job but me and 4 others. Management was a joke. They sat around in the office and got mad when people asked for help.
PetSmart,1doutv06pb8ai804,2.0,"It's aight, but don't get stuck there. Best person for this job would be a workaholic who enjoys a fast paced environment with lots of rules. Over achievers welcome, but they definitely won't pay as much as you deserve"
PetSmart,1doujp5okh41i802,3.0,I enjoyed my time working at petsmart. I love working with animals and the staff made coming in everyday welcoming. It was a great place to work and would do it again.
PetSmart,1douaa2rvh3lt804,1.0,Was horrible the managers all play head games. Was scheduled for part time 4hr stocking shifts. Was expected to get one pallet of merchandise worked in an hour but was getting written up for not finishing the truck. Truck would come in with 16 pallets and I was only scheduled for four hours
PetSmart,1dot95h8q5n8r801,3.0,"Typical day is Customer experience is a priority,  checking  daily / through out the day  ensuring all animals have food, water  if  illness occurs to  immediately be  taken to a veterinarian.  Daily product  shelves full  and abundant for the customer, Workplace Culture  recognition of associates, hardest part of job lifting large items, tanks , kennels, 30+lbs of food. most enjoyable part of job pets."
PetSmart,1doslb9rbbre9802,1.0,"Management would let personal life interfere with the work environment creating a hostile environment. The pay is competitive, so the last person that got hired on gets more than everyone else."
PetSmart,1dos6bfadh45i802,1.0,"I worked at petsmart over the summer. I feel like I was robbed of my training because my trainer had multiple people so everytime I needed help, I had to wait when I could of been working. The trainer was good when I had him. He did his job but I felt like I would have succeeded better with one on one training.  I didn’t like my supervisor because he would talk to me crazy. He didn’t have people skills. Its kind of hard to keep a positive attitude all night when he nit picks and won’t let me do what I came to do. The manager it’s a sociable person either. He doesn’t speak to anyone. I never worked a job where the management team doesn’t acknowledge their associates especially when they are new. I knew if I continued to work there that I would end of getting fired so I quit to save the hassle. The pay is decent on paper but when you actually start working you’ll see that it’s not worth it."
PetSmart,1dos5g5vgh3ph802,4.0,"Fun and fast paced. Manager and salary are poor. There's a lot of hard physical work that all employees are expected to perform. Including throwing and stocking freight, custodial work such as cleaning and mopping bathrooms and the entire store."
PetSmart,1dos3lkonh3hi802,3.0,"It's not a hard job but it can get busy at certain hours depending on the location. I don't want to shy people away from applying to PetSmart, just know who the managers are and talk to the employees. It heavily depends on management. Some managers from personal experience are more relaxed and give you more leeway in terms of how you can operate at work. Some managers will change things around to favor their own paychecks at the expense of the animals and/or the employees. Overall it isn't a bad job, but it can be based on location."
PetSmart,1dorgleooh45i802,2.0,"I used to love this job so very much and now it hurts to go into work every day. My threshold for stress has gotten to the point where my every waking moment is spent thinking about my job. And quite frankly, I do not get paid enough for that level of intense stress. I have given my time, dedication, and passion to Petsmart and all I have to show for it is a cumulation of 50 cents in raises over the last two years. Time and time again I have asked for raises and promotions and been passed up for people who have been with Petsmart for less time and have less experience than me. The only reason I was ever given for my lack of advancement within the company was due to my schooling and yet there have been several instances of other people in college getting promotions over me. Never was I spoken to about my behavior on the job or my attendance, never a plausible reason for why I could not advance. I proved that I was capable of working full time and going to school and was ignored.  Then I was told there was a part time supervisor position and still I was ignored. I was told that I was a good employee, promotions and raises were dangled before me like carrots with nothing to show for it. Still, I remained. I watched as people with no experience with animals were brought in as management, listened to employees complain about the same things I had with absolutely nothing done to help, and did my best to ignore the constant barrage of passive aggressive treatment from supervisors. Corporate has now decided to initiate some of the dumbest policies I have ever seen. Not only are they"
PetSmart,1dor6q8k5bre9802,3.0,"An average day ranges from busy to hectic at PetSmart. No matter what, there are always more tasks to be done, my superiors find something to be dissatisfied with, and I feel a lack of overall fulfillment. ""It must be so nice to work here, you get to play with animals all day!"" In truth, there is not enough time to interact with animals for more than a few seconds at a time while still accomplishing all expected tasks. Furthermore, it is fundamentally a retail environment. There is an expected death rate of all animals housed in store. Fundamentally, if you are sensitive to the welfare of animals, you are a poor fit for the position as you will become upset either by the standards kept within the company, or the countless customers you will experience who outright neglect or abuse animals while you observe powerlessly. There are constant expectations to be more productive, make more sales, convert more shoppers into buyers and buyers into members, get donations... It is a sales position, in a customer service industry, and all aspects related to animal interaction are rushed, minimal, and standardized. This workplace is a good fit for some people, but not for most I have personally experienced in my five and a half years of working there."
PetSmart,1dopo9rur5ncs802,2.0,Petsmart is a very cutthroat work environment. Management cares nothing for their employees and only about bettering themselves and numbers on a piece of paper.
PetSmart,1dopbmhld5n8r800,3.0,Management is poor and no one cares. I wouldnt recommend working there if u dont likje drama but for the most part everythihgn is ok i guess. i just dont liek how thungs are ran
PetSmart,1donebo1hbre9802,3.0,"Minimal training, I was basically set off on my own after like 3 days to do everything. Their pet husbandry is sub par to say the least. They promote all animal's well being but still sell tiny hamster/ bird cages and betta bowls(aka the devil)."

PetSmart,1don7m3ofb86l801,3.0,Applied for several career advancement opportunities at the other Petsmart stores and was turned down. The store managers are a joke. Poor management. Upper management is not held accountable. Required to work all holidays. Schedule constantly changes with no 2 days off in a row. Hours are always short in retail. Health care coverage is mediocre.
PetSmart,1dommk8leh45i800,2.0,"I applied for Pet care Specialist. It took over 2 weeks and me asking, to be trained in the pet department. I was put on registers every shift before then. Management was rude and snarky. Not sure if it was just my location, but definitely would not recommend."
PetSmart,1dom7spnd52t0800,1.0,"The grooming salon had the worst groomers. They are all extremely malicious, toxic, racist, sexist, and full of hatred towards every bather in the salon and even against each other. In the beginning they pretend to be good, friendly, people, but then it's like they flip a switch and suddenly you're in a grooming salon full of a bunch of rabid wolves trying to rip you apart for no reason other than jealousy and self hatred. The managers weren't any better because they just sat and watched you fight off the wolves and wouldn't take any of your complaints about them seriously. The employees there act like they are still in high school by gossiping about, tricking, manipulating, gaslighting, and harassing others. Whereas management would allow this to happen and would do their best to get you in trouble so that they could fire you in order to keep you quiet about the harmful work environment in the grooming salon. To make matters worse you are not paid nearly enough for the work they make you do (along with the work the groomers will push onto you so they don't have to do their own work) and yet you're expected to bare through it and meet their ridiculous sales quotas.They try to make it seem like the pay you are getting is okay by giving you a 25 cent raise AFTER A YEAR as if to say, ""See? we pay you well! you even got a raise! you're welcome now stop complaining."" So, do not work at this location if you want to keep your sanity because this place is a literal mad house full of crazies and horrible people who should not be allowed to live in this society.(Oh and the crazy groomers"
PetSmart,1dol56atk5ncs800,2.0,"I work in the Doggie Day Camp/Boarding facilities in PetSmart. We are constantly understaffed so every day is stressful and a gamble. We recently got a new manager for the hotel, who is wonderful, but we also got a new store manager who is very unsympathetic and has caused many people to quit or consider quitting. The people I've worked with closely have generally been very kind, the further up the ladder you get with people coming into the store the ruder they are. They treat us as replaceable but nobody wants to apply for a job with us because the starting pay is trash. The hardest part of the job is how unpredictable it is, accidents happen, sometimes we get lots of people coming in to drop of dogs when we don't expect many. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with our clients and their dogs. PetSmart was like a second home to me and it really saddens me that the management has gone downhill and how corporate is changing things about Doggie Day Camp which just makes an already high stress environment even more stressful as well as puts us, as employees, in danger. PetSmart says associate safety is their number one priority. Based on what I've seen since Elevated Doggie Day Camp that seems to unfortunately not be the case."
PetSmart,1dokuodqn52t0805,5.0,It was very productive but overaly fun. I get to see the pets that comes in. Get to pet some of the cousterms pet dogs. The staff was really nice and also between breaks wasn't that bad.
PetSmart,1dokg3kcph3hi801,2.0,Work a lot more hours due to unrealistic expectations of upper management.  Too much division within various departments make it hard to get the store to be a cohesive unit
PetSmart,1doik417jb86l802,3.0,"A lot of time on your feet. PetSmart will send you to grooming school, all paid. They will support you as a new stylist and do their best to help you with difficult tasks."
PetSmart,1doifag9l52t0802,5.0,Imagine working at a place where you get to give treats to puppies and dogs and help them pick out their own toys! If you love animals and helping to save lives this is the place for you. They offer 1 free wellness plan for your pet and 15% off at the vet (Banfield) and everything in store and online. Prior to working for them I have been volunteering at Petsmart Charities for 2 years. This is a dream job.
PetSmart,1doibll6eh3hi802,2.0,"When I first started at PetSmart, I was really excited and that quickly left after the first month or so. I mean ya they teach you some basics but you could learn that elsewhere. I worked in the salon as a dog bather and thought about going to grooming school but after hearing that you have to sign a two-year contract I decided not too. I was always looked down on because of that and not treated fairly. Corporate is terrible. Some of the coworkers are nice and were a big reason why I stayed for so long."
PetSmart,1dohrhcvmh3ph802,2.0,"Not a great company. It's a corporation, so obviously the higher-ups don't care about your well being, they care about making money. The manager in the salon was NOT this way, but the store manager was. Employees were great."

PetSmart,1dohjrutrb86l802,1.0,The new owner that took over ran PetSmart like a corporation. Taking hours and adding less staff. Creating a dangerous environment for the dogs under our care. It has been years so it could be different but this really ruined a fun place to work.

PetSmart,1dohd8jsn5j4t802,3.0,"Management is poor. For anything to be done it has to go through the chain of command and sometimes up through corporate. All associates are just a number. If you don’t reach your weekly goals you’re humiliated sometimes in front of other workers, threatened with write ups and or put on paper. This job is a great as a stepping stone but nothing permanent."
PetSmart,1doh7kck3h3lt801,2.0,"If you’re a male, same pay, but you’ll be running register anytime a females snapchat story gets updated, plus any cleaning, unloading trucks, and carrying 50+lbs bags on your shoulder all day. In my case, 2am-1pm 6 days a week. Took 2 years to get an extra 37 cents. I quit when my stock manager went on vacation (he was great) and his replacement was a 109lb girl (including her surgically attached phone) to haul stock. Spoiler alert: she did nothing."
PetSmart,1doh1e9s7h3th803,2.0,The job is easy and customers are ok. Hire external more then promoting inside.  Higher management will cover themselves before supporting you.  Even when your in the right.
PetSmart,1dogu727ah45i803,5.0,I enjoyed working here very much. It was a pleasure to be surrounded by pets all day. The staff is very knowledgeable about their departments. There are very few opportunities for full time status with benefits.
PetSmart,1dog9tulth3lt802,2.0,No room for advancement. Decide your worth before you get to show them. Disrespectful and unfair. Didn’t even get trained on my position because they didn’t want to train me. Do not follow protocol.
PetSmart,1dof5vgu65j4j802,3.0,Great pay but not worth your health Or well being. They don’t care about any real personal matter and kind of focus you to continue to work there. Not a job for someone small or short.
PetSmart,1dof1lh8t52sm804,4.0,A good company that truly pushes you to be the best. The company is always looking for talent that can help them continue being the best pet retailer. Good pay. Good work life balance. The job / career is what you make it.

If they are always in a team player mood it shows and the customer can see it too petsmart was all about the pets and guest but in my last 3 years it became stressful, all about making  sales, I was a company i enjoyed to work for. fall from being what they where all about, i loved working for petsmart but I believe my goals where different form them"
PetSmart,1doe9q637h45a802,3.0,"Loved working with animals but hated working retail.  Most important for them was earning the dollar, over employees. Facility was terrible, dirty. Lack of sufficient lighting"
PetSmart,1docogk0mb86c802,3.0,"The store I worked at is a fun place to work, however, I could never rely on the scheduling manager to give consistent hours so I could pay my rent and get groceries etc."
PetSmart,1doch2r1ph3ha802,4.0,"Management while I worked there was actually pretty great. The managers had your back, and they were supportive. The job was fun and fairly easy. I would go back if I could."

PetSmart,1doap0gn2h3p9800,4.0,Working at Petsmart gave me the opportunity to cross multiple times. It gave me the confidence in going after what I want. I enjoy working for Petsmart.
PetSmart,1doa649mdh3ha801,3.0,PetSmart is a good company if your young and/or in school and your okay with the ridiculous low amount of hours they give you! But there is no advancement and if you do get advanced it’s because they need someone new to blame. You apply for a specific position and they would have you doing task that is not in your job description and make you feel like you have no say! They do not compensate you for any extra task/hours that you do... for example if I’m coming in at 3am I should be getting a little extra..
PetSmart,1doa0pl2ih3t9802,5.0,The petshotel in petsmart is a fun place to work because their Is always dogs around. But it can also be stressful when you get a high volume of pets.
PetSmart,1do9g3dr8h3ha804,5.0,"I enjoyed working for PetSmart. The associates have a real passion, the animals are awesome to be around in the work environment, and there’s a variety in the tasks you get to do each day."
PetSmart,1do7taj7lh3p6800,1.0,Store manager tells teammates to do things she won't do herself. Such as taking care of some of the animals. Hours are inconsistent and they keep hiring people. Not worth my time so I quit for better paying and better hours.
PetSmart,1do7ikefh0kbq002,4.0,"Working as a receptionist for the Petsmart Grooming Salon, my work day was built on four consistent duties: scheduling appointments, checking customers and their pets in/out, answering phones, and maintaining a safe and clean work environment.  Training was easy to follow, allowing me to maintain a firm grasp on the scheduling program used, and the duties expected of me, before working on the floor.  And even when I slipped up, I had a wonderful set of coworkers to guild me!"
PetSmart,1do7a9ogv0mtm002,5.0,Working here  I have be able to express my love for animals and learn so much. I enjoyed working with people helping them find the perfect pet they  want or helping them with the furry friend they already have.
PetSmart,1do6vtqp9h457801,5.0,I absolutely loved working at this store and location! There was a wonderful environment with a lot of people and animals that came in on a daily basis.
PetSmart,1do5g8o1pb8a2802,1.0,"This is absolutely the worst work environment. They continuously hire childish, abusive managers. I would never work here again. The amount of drama I've had to put up with is ridiculous."
PetSmart,1do4qptt4b867802,4.0,"There were times at my specific store that working was less than enjoyable, but Petsmart is a great company with plenty of opportunities to learn new skills and grow."
PetSmart,1do2rdb1vb82i802,2.0,"so i love my job. i love playing and taking care of the dogs and cats. however, the management is a joke. They expect you to dedicate your entire life to the job. Ive gotten calls/texts from very late at night asking for a shift, and at the same time cutting your scheduled hours. Also, they only care about profit and not the well being of the dogs."
PetSmart,1do1ct056h3h7802,3.0,"Petsmart is a good place to work at for college students. That’s about it. Stocking at petsmart is an alright job. It would be a lot better if they had more then 3 people, including myself, unloading truck. Everyone gets told about not getting truck done but won’t hire more people. Other then that, it’s an ok job. Pay isn’t the greatest either."
PetSmart,1do09dh1h0mcn002,4.0,It's a nice job to get by college or if you need any side money. The work space at PetSmart is friendly and everyone gets along but when a crowd comes is when things get serious.
PetSmart,1do099obgb82i800,5.0,"It was everything i expected to be , really challenging but once you understand its really worth it and fun. I got to meet a lot of great people and great pets. My experience was one for the books that for sure !!"
PetSmart,1dnvm4kkmh3h7801,5.0,I love petsmart it is my favorite place I love the dogs and cats and birds and reptiles and the passionate associates. There really is no better place to work than for PetSmart!
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1dnvl5gs50mcn002,5.0,A typical day requires a lot of interaction with pet parents assisting them in finding the right solution for their unique problem. I learned a lot about the animals I care for and how to tweak their environment based on a certain animals needs. The hardest part of the job is getting a pet parents who isn't satisfied with your initial suggestion to their problem and coming up with something a little different but with the outcome they're hoping for.
PetSmart,1dnvk9hlqh3p6801,3.0,When I first started the job was fairly good. With the changing of managers the job culture went down to be very petty and difficult to enjoy. By the end of my time there I was dreading going into work.
PetSmart,1dnvikn810kbq002,2.0,It was a ok place to work when i worked there it was only part time. at the time i worked there the manager was ok but not the best. I would never go back there to work.
PetSmart,1dnvh87m2brdt80a,4.0,"I like working here management wise. I'm not a big fan of retail. I had to deal with my fair share of rude customers, but that's what you get when you work retail. I got good hours."
PetSmart,1dnv8ncufh3t6804,2.0,I enjoyed working there for as long as I did. I met great people there great friendships there also. I loved the organización we had there as a team..
PetSmart,1dnv380eob8a2801,2.0,"At first, I loved working at PetSmart. The team seemed nice, the work isn't strenuous in the pet care, customer service, and cashier departments. Unfortunately, though, I quickly learned that everyone in the establishment talks horrible about one another when they're not around, the managers disclose other's private information to other coworkers, and the pay frankly just sucks. Most department stores pay their employees additional to early morning stock. Not here at least not in Waynesville, NC. Overall, this is just a job. They don't truly care about their employees whatsoever."
PetSmart,1dntoqous0mtg004,1.0,There was poor management and it made most employees dread coming to work. I used to love going to work and interacting with the customers and pets but things changed quickly.
PetSmart,1dnsi1r9rh3h3805,5.0,I enjoyed my time working in the Saint Joseph Petsmart.  My coworkers were like a second family and the customers were always nice. Definitely miss them.
PetSmart,1dns8dpkfh41380e,4.0,Anything other than leadership is constant fun with pets and customer interactions. In Store Events are a blast and the company does a good job of recognizing their associates.
PetSmart,1dnqmcvrqh3le802,4.0,"I used to like dogs until I started working here. Now, for the most part, I dislike both them and dog owners. There's just something off about people who will be bitten and pooped on and so stressed out working with a pet to the point of tears... only for an hour later to be kissing all up in the pets faces and going ""I still love you though!"". I don't get that. Even some customers SEE their dogs practically trying to murder us and they have the nerve to laugh or get upset when we end up declining the service. I'm bleeding in three different places and you're threatening to call corporate on me because I don't love your dog enough to continue the service? What? I got a report about me a while ago from a customer claiming I shouldn't work there because I wasn't kissing on his dog like other groomers were kissing on other dogs while I was giving his a nail trim. I don't love anything or anyone just because I interact with it. I don't kiss on anything unless I WANT TO. At least I learned how to stick up for myself working here, so I will definitely thank this place for that much."
PetSmart,1dnq9vqccb82b803,3.0,Honestly it's great to start out and learn in as a baby groomer. Everything in your training gets paid for but the training barely teaches you anything because you're only being trained for 4 weeks. If you're lucky enough the more experienced groomers will teach you and take you under their wing and help you out. But the company overall doesn't really care about their groomers happiness. They don't charge enough for what the work is worth and they hand out refunds like free candy and the discounts they constantly hand out comes out of the groomers commission instead of the company's half.Those discounts add up fast and they expect you to over stress yourself on a regular basis.You become burned out and then it becomes unsafe for the dogs. You're lucky if you have a salon manager that will have you're back over a client just trying to get a free groom out of them.
PetSmart,1dnorv17sh3p2804,4.0,"I dont mind it, its a nice place to work, kind people, needs vetter healthcare an dental plans. Overall its a decent place to work at especially for a first time job."
PetSmart,1dnokvkvv0mtg004,5.0,I have a good day everyday a work. I Love my job & I Love working with kids. No hard work & I love the teacher everyone is nice. I can see about my kids
PetSmart,1dnog07fgh453801,3.0,"Very fast paced from open to close. Checking in dogs, making appointments, wash dry and groom dogs, clean between each pet, provide great customer service. The management was good at times but the company is going through so many new changes to the point that the salon is left to work without upper management help. Every company does their best but I feel there needs to be more changes in store rather then just on the corporate level. The hardest part of this job was lack of management assistance and volume of customers with no staff and little space to accomplish the amount of dogs required to get done in a shift. Although I did love my salon team. We all had each others backs and we worked extremely hard to get everything done each day."
PetSmart,1dnoc551jh3t2804,3.0,"I really liked working at pet care here. I felt like everyone really cared about creating the best environment for the in store animals and really tried to ensure that they were going to good home to the best of our ability. I liked my managers and coworkers, though I don't believe most of them are still there."
PetSmart,1dnnemo5kh453801,1.0,"Since the company changed ownership 5 years ago, the moral has gone down. It is no longer the place to work to gain valuable retail knowledge. On top of it, they treat their animals very poorly. Multiple animals would get sick in their care but the higher ups did not find it suitable to bring them to the vet due to the low cost of the animal. Grooming department needs to close. COuntless dogs either getting cut or hurt in their care."
PetSmart,1dnndl16oh3le800,4.0,"If you love animals than it’s a place for you but it can get extremely hectic and busy, like leave with a migraine busy. No opportunity for advancement and management only cares about sales. It’s ok for a bit bit but I wouldn’t want to get stuck for years"
PetSmart,1dnmlrvlrb82b800,5.0,Working with animals is always fun and energizing. Customer first priority but will always take care of employees. Great place to expand your knowledge of animal and related tech.
PetSmart,1dnme1k58b861802,5.0,i loved working there they have a good energy and good hours. they have fair pay and they gave raises. they maintain a good clean environment. if they rehired me i would definitely go back

PetSmart,1dnlaksfp0mtg002,2.0,"Poor management and employees are kept in place, promoted, or hired due to who they know, not how well their job is done. Favoritism, nepotism ignored"
PetSmart,1dnl9emrmb89r802,3.0,Petsmart doesn’t pay its full time employees enough to make a living. They are overworked due to how labor strict corporate is. Made major labor cut this last year and expect improved performance with less labor. My two in-store managers only care about themselves and give themselves the best shifts and don’t hardly work when they are there
PetSmart,1dnl0deoqh3le801,2.0,"I can’t say I had much experience with PetSmart. I only worked there maybe 2-3 weeks and I hated it. I’m moving out of state soon on a short notice and had to quit anyways. But my training really turned me off of it. The guy that trained me treated me like I was stupid. The other guy that trained me was boring and made the job seem super easy, when I’m reality, I only had one day to train in Pet Care and one day as Cashier, so cramming all of the information in my head while being a full time college student was ridiculous and stressful."
PetSmart,1dnjk3an0h3p2802,5.0,Great job great management just wish u could've worked there for a lot longer. I miss where I worked at. And still want to groom.  But I will do what God calls me to do and I met some life long friends that will be there til the end and petsmart put me through academy and I finished and I know I did great there for as long as I could have.
PetSmart,1dngg12khh453802,5.0,I liked helping the dogs get a home I mat some really great people while I was there helping out. even got free food from volunteer sometimes I hoped that this helped
PetSmart,1dnfuqmsoh413800,5.0,"I love working there it is a small family. Everyone works together as a team. You get to work with animals all day. See new and regular, you make very good relationship with pet owners and regular customers. i loved working here."
PetSmart,1dnfai3qt0mci007,5.0,I loved working with the dogQQs and cats. I loved being able to relieved of stress cause I was around animals I love. The manager and coworkers made sure we had a way to work and had the help we needed. We looked out for eachother. If your not comfortable doing a task their always someone else willing to help.
PetSmart,1dnegp92lh413802,5.0,Management is firm but fair. Everyone genuinely cares about each other and we all work as a team. There is great communication between both co-workers and management.  Also feel we have the greatest customers come in that are very appreciative of the assistance you are able to provide.
PetSmart,1dndhluuvh453806,4.0,Petsmart is not a bad company to work for but they will push you to see what you can handle. They are very compassionate and basically become your family.
PetSmart,1dncrelcqh413801,3.0,I believe Petsmart should pay people with lots of experience a little more than they do. Then they only want to give you 20 hours a week. I believe they should have more training and maybe just one person should do the training so everyone is train the same.
PetSmart,1dnbs4ddgb860802,5.0,Positive and encouraging environment.  Professional and empathic employers.  A wonderful addition to our community.  Proof that there is room for everyone.
PetSmart,1dnbjoluah3p1801,5.0,I knew the store manager (he was my former manager) and called me and asked if I was wanting to change careers and offered me better pay. Yes the work was hard at time but overall satisfying.
PetSmart,1dnb9c2peb82a804,4.0,Petsmart was great.. I loved working there. My manager and coworkers were so helpful! I did not like the fact that we all had to learn cashier. I worked in petcare and loved it..hated cashier!! But they don't pay much and you don't get benefits. That is the only reason I had to leave!
PetSmart,1dnb1gusbh3ld800,3.0,"Just your regular retail job, the most annoying part was not scheduling enough people. It wasn't always super busy but when it was, it was hard to find someone to come and help back you up."
PetSmart,1dnamssti5nbv802,4.0,"Easy work , discounts on everything in store ..I honestly liked working there ..My coworkers were awesome and management was great...If your not an early morning person this job may not be for you..."
PetSmart,1dnaiof40h452802,5.0,"On the one hand, it's just another retail store. The routine shelf-stocking and other retail tasks are something you'll either hate or not. That's up to each individual. But the interaction with pets, especially dogs, makes this an outstanding place to work. As with all retail chains, the local management team has far more impact on you than the people at corporate headquarters. And each individual store is what it is. Some are great. Some are adequate. Some will steal your soul. But if you work at a Petsmart store, and it become unbearable, a transfer to a different store can be just as effective for making things better as a whole new job."
PetSmart,1dn8ti49ab82a802,1.0,The hanford petsmart has the worst management. Favoritism and discrimination is strong in this store. if you dont conform to the box they want they are quick to get rid of people. Be careful if you decided to last long term..
PetSmart,1dn6iee4gh3p0802,5.0,"Great Company! Wouldn’t leave If I didn’t have to relocate. Many opportunities to progress within the company, development programs for associates to progress later and  Great discounts"
PetSmart,1dn68d2lih3p0803,4.0,if you like working with pets it's a nice place to work . Customers bring their pets in to be groomed you see many different kinds. You are able to learn many different diets of all pets
PetSmart,1dn5ta1b6h3lc801,2.0,Terrible management!! They pick and choose their favorites and they are the ones who actually get hours and they cut everyone else's! If you do anything management doesn't like they will remake the schedule immediately and cut you to 4 HOURS PER WEEK!! I love the actual store but management is completely horrible!
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1dn5klmigh451802,2.0,"You never get a chance to advance , and you don't get training to advance. Employees and managers were always talking behind eachtohers back saying nasty things . Work was never evenly distributed between employees , two people would do all the hard work while the other four on shift stood around and talked and went on paid breaks ."
PetSmart,1dn3ntsunb89p802,3.0,"Management was a little bit too sales and quota focused, didn't get to know their employees very well. Place was clean and organized however and had a good way of running things"
PetSmart,1dn30avecb85v802,3.0,"They offer a lot of benefits that were really great (for example, their health insurance listed that they would help with medicine and surgical procedures to transition mtf/ftm) and they do try to make sure their employees are compensated. Discretionary and sick pay, two weeks paid vacation as a full-time groomer, an hourly base rate as a safety net if you didn't reach your commission. However, they are a corporate business, first and foremost, ruled by profit growth and appeal to buyers. They emphasize safety and avoiding getting overstressed, but push to make more money, take more dogs, sell more things. Do all these extra things to make the customer happy but continue to do your regular duties too, in the same amount of time. They churn out commercial groomers, and it's more about the money of grooming than about the skill and art of grooming. Groomers get a crash course in grooming and then they're sent back to groom under a more experienced groomer, but the more experienced groomer isn't given the extra time to teach a newer groomer. They create groomers that can groom, but not groom /well/, and the pet parents don't know or don't care about the difference. There also tends to be a LOT of drama in the workplace, though that's bound to come when you have multiple people together working long hours with stressful conditions in a small space. It's good for what it is, but for people passionate about grooming, they might be better off at a mom and pop grooming shop."
PetSmart,1dn2v7mf4h3p0802,1.0,Started off bottom of ladder and worked my way into management.
PetSmart,1dn1h48vfh3lc802,1.0,"When I started working at Petsmart I was a professional dog bather, as a dog bather you make close to minimum wage whereas at places like petco you make 40-50% commission on every dog you do PLUS an hourly pay (basically you can work really hard and not get the money you deserve that day). tips are of course nice but not a guarantee. Also what they don't tell you in the job interview is that once you take the job you are signing a online paper that says when you leave, (whether they fire you or you leave on your own terms), you can not go to a ""competing"" place to work for 6 months after you leave in a 30 mile radius of that store. That is with ALL positions at Petsmart in the salon and as a trainer. Also my goal as a bather was to work up and take advantage of the schooling they offered to become a dog groomer but I suggest to others to not take that offer because if you ever wanted to leave you can't go anywhere for 6 months and also they make you sign another contract saying that you have to stay with the company for 3 YEARS and if you quit OR they fire you, you owe them over $5,000."
PetSmart,1dn0orga55nbu800,4.0,"PetSmart is a good company to work for especially for anyone looking to work with animals or learn new skills.  It's tough work that keeps you on your toes but is very fulfilling.  My only complaints are, as a Pet Trainer, they don't really give much time to complete the tasks required of the job and once you take on the position there is little to no room for advancement within the retail management side of things.  Also, the compensation isn't the best for Pet Trainers with commissions being about 20% of $120 and then that being doled out over a six week period.  I would recommend this job for someone looking to start training pets but it's not a long term career option."
PetSmart,1dn0f44n0b89p802,4.0,Petsmarr is a pretty decent company to work for in my experience. Management is pretty well rounded and willing to work with their associates. Id recommend

PetSmart,1dmtsnf5qh3p0802,1.0,A typical day at work depends on where you are in the company and the management. But it was stressful and sometimes painful. Management didn't even care to listen to the employees as they knew they wouldn't stay long.
PetSmart,1dmtg9gsbh3p0801,4.0,"Aside from having a very unproffesional and new GM to the industry, i thoroughly enjoyed my time with this company. I fully understand that one person doesn't represent a whole company, and the company itself is very inclusive and promotes a healthy work culture"
PetSmart,1dms6cb1sh3p0806,4.0,"This is a wonderful place to work and I was incredibly sad to have to leave it. The manager is wonderful and she trains very well, the animal care is of optimal importance and the tore is set up very nicely. If this job had paid more I would have never left."
PetSmart,1dms3odsqh3t0802,1.0,A typical day of work would be getting yelled at by customers.  The blame game from Management.  Working hard gave you more responsibilities with no room for advancements.  Loved working with the animals and some customers.
PetSmart,1dmrrck0lb85v800,5.0,"I love my job, it's made me realize the career path I want. I love working with animals and now i get to work with them every day. Meeting customers and build a relationship with them and their pets is truly wonderful"
PetSmart,1dmrq96r3h3t0800,4.0,"With the right team, Petsmart is a great place to kick-start you work experience, or even begin a career path. Learning anything from Pet grooming, Pet care, Pet Training, and stocking, they do not leave you without educating you!"

PetSmart,1dmptvikjh40u802,4.0,I love working as an Associate. The work atmosphere is friendly and fair. Only being offered PT no FT positions unless management is financially hard.
PetSmart,1dmptd0m8brdj802,5.0,"A typical day at work, nothing big just the usual, cleaning and grooming the pets there. I learned a lot there from changing certain liquids to bathing the animals which I loved and the best part in my opinion."
PetSmart,1dmpkj08lh3st802,2.0,"This job is so awful. It could’ve just been my salon, but the work environment was full of toxic people and high school-like drama. All they care about is numbers.

PetSmart,1dmpa1dgm52ua802,4.0,I really enjoyed working for PetSmart. They were very understanding during family emergencies and necessities. However the pay was just not enough to compensate for childcare.
PetSmart,1dmp9ige75nab805,5.0,They are patient and understanding. They are willing to help you advance to higher positions pretty quickly but without worry or anxiety. They became my second family and I do not regret working for them.
PetSmart,1dmos7l7oh3l9802,4.0,I would come in either in the morning or afternoon I would take care of animals and help customers. In the morning I would have to feed all the animals.
PetSmart,1dmo3ehtjh44u802,4.0,"As a groomer in petsmart the feel of the salon really depends on the management styles of your managers. I dont want to make a mess of a whole company in my reveiw for a few bad eggs. The company has a great goal in mind. Its built around an idea of a great work place culter but not every manager adheres to those goals, guild lines or mind set. There are policies in place that are easy to access and if you follow them AND KNOW THEM you will be fine. Its a great place to get your foot in the door and build an education and experiance (also to find out if this is really the job for you)."
PetSmart,1dmnqqe8nb85r801,5.0,Petsmart was extremely helpful in any thing that their workers needed and were always supportive of us. Petsmart always had trainings for their workers to not only help workers but to also boost sales because if workers knew more then it would also help translate into more sales.
PetSmart,1dmnccb96b825802,2.0,If you have a good manager they understand that you work hard because they understand and they’re there to see it and empathize.If you have a bad manager which is mostly the case numbers only matter and they’re never in your department unless there’s a problem.Not to mention the favoritism even from the district leader!
PetSmart,1dmn8jronh3l9800,3.0,"The job itself is hard work unless you're strictly a day camp associate. Even then, being stuck standing in a play room for 8 hours with sometimes very little human interaction can be taxing. The health of the dogs in our care are highly dependent on our skills of observation and care taking. Yet, working as hard as we do and with all the responsibilities we have, we still are only paid minimum wage or slightly above."
PetSmart,1dmmea5k8h40u804,2.0,"At one point PetSmart was amazing: a focus on developing great leaders and a very cooperative enviroment. I grew a lot. But that all ended about 5yrs ago and every year we have been expected to do more work less subtitles I no longer feel I was given the tools required to succeed. When dealing with animal care, there comes a point when further cuts become unacceptable and i couldn't expect my team to provide a level of care that I was comfortable with"
PetSmart,1dmmbrrk95nab802,3.0,"After nearly 2 years with the company, I've applied to at least 3 different positions (1 position twice) and was declined each time with poor explanation. It seemed that the leadership wasn't interested in me advancing, despite saying otherwise. I am a consistently reliable and hard-working employee who gets along with everyone there, so it seems suspicious that leadership doesn't want me to advance."
PetSmart,1dmm9eae4h3ot800,3.0,"Overall, it had its ups and downs, but I very much enjoyed working for PetSmart. I enjoyed being around animals all day as well as being able to work hands on with them."
PetSmart,1dmkk0jiph3gu802,4.0,"I worked in the PetsHotel so my day consisted of providing care for dogs and cats that were either in daycamp or boarding. There was always something to be done which was a little stressful but it meant I learned a lot when it came to animal care. I fed, cleaned, bathed, clipped nails, and watched over the dogs while they were in camp."
PetSmart,1dmkgpouph3ot802,4.0,It’s was a great experience I Enjoyed my time while I was there. They gave plenty of opportunities for associates to move up & excel with in the company. All & all it was a nice company to work for
PetSmart,1dmjmus3i5j6j802,3.0,"I was mostly on my own taking care of all the pets in our store, It was fun if you like animals like I do. I also sold the pets and explained how to take care of them"
PetSmart,1dmjf4nomh44u800,2.0,"Hours are inconsistent, management is bad and has no care for their employees. Always complained the few times i called in sick. Too much work for one person in the back while working overnight."
PetSmart,1dmht8eja5ndt802,4.0,"When I arrived to work, I would normally already have a dog ready for me to bathe and blow dry. I didn't have to many duties on the job besides wash up dogs. Half of the time I would sweep up the shaved fur from dogs being groomed and book appointments for all clients, as well as give dogs hands on assessment for approved services."
PetSmart,1dmhg50f45n9r802,3.0,"Although the job was fun and easy to achieve, the willingness and readiness to move up left more to be desired.  If youre looking for a first job to get to work with animals than this is for you"
PetSmart,1dmhb4i1rb85m802,3.0,"First couple of weeks or so will be working in the camp rooms where you watch 1 - 15 dogs. Normally start in the small camp and if they are comfortable and you are comfortable with handling the bigger dogs then most days you are in both camp rooms for most of your shift. Overtime, you'll learn how to walk dogs from one place to another, care for cats, check ins, check outs of boarders or day cares, basic bathing duties, food preparations, and cleaning rooms."
PetSmart,1dmh684g4h3sq800,3.0,"Cooperate salon, has its pros and cons like every other retail places . It really depends on the store you work at and the management team............"
PetSmart,1dmej1lj5b85m800,2.0,"I enjoyed the job, don't get me wrong. However, the longer I stayed in pet care and saw the condition that these animals came to us in broke me. They kept syrian hamsters in groups (syrian hamsters will kill cage mates), did not provide proper diet, had so many ringworm and wet tail outbreaks, and we had ""lost"" multiple reptiles just for their corpses to  be found under buckets in the back."
PetSmart,1dme789f3h40r801,3.0,My only complaint is lack of advancement opportunities from within the company. Plus the fact that outside of work managers are not allowed to be social with associates. In a small town like Hutchinson people are close. But corporate says you can’t have friendships with management which is very ignorant.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1dmdbhggub89i801,1.0,"I worked there for a little over 2 months and hated every minute of it. You're sandwiched in at non-private desks just inches away from someone else. No assigned seating. Loud because of coworkers and dogs barking. So disorganized as far as how to even establish a call flow, hence, their 2 types of teams (incentive and non-incentive). Every week you get a QA score & if you mess up on one little unimportant thing such as an unnecessary note, they score you low. Makes it so stressful. All computers were a joke - slow & glitchy. People stole my food out of the fridges. Bunch of young, immature loud coworkers. What could have been and easy and laid-back job was a nightmare. I was so happy to quit."
PetSmart,1dmcdai0rb81j800,5.0,"Petsmart was fun and innovative with its competitive hours and shifts , it made working feel great especially when you get to witness all the smiles you can provide for all of the customers."
PetSmart,1dmc5if4uh3oq800,5.0,great place to work. positive working environment. customer service is hard. but mostly enjoyable customers. hours are good and pay is well if you work hard and deserve it
PetSmart,1dmc0jg8k52tr800,5.0,I enjoyed working at PetSmart lets of awards selling pet training and getting these people off the right start for their puppies and kittens one place shopping for all your pets need' s for the  life of your pet I worked for PetSmart for 13 years
PetSmart,1dmbp0dvoh40r802,3.0,It’s a good environment. If you like animals it’s a job for you. The people are very nice too. Everyone is very helpful. Makes things easier for everyone.
PetSmart,1dmblkn3ch44r800,1.0,"I have worked many part time jobs but this one is by far the worst ran company I have ever seen. The management is so all over the place, the stocking is extremely unorganized and all the animals are poorly cared for. Honestly I believe the whole entire Petsmart company should be shut down."
PetSmart,1dmalll9hb81j801,3.0,"My personal experience wasn't great, but that had more to do with the employees and management and less to do with the company itself. There was a lot of two faced silliness happening, especially the managers. It wasn't uncommon for them to praise you then talk bad about you behind your back before they finally tell you that you're not doing x,y, and z. Not a lot of trust to be had in that specific store. That being said, I'm sure not every PetSmart has this problem, and it can happen in any job."
PetSmart,1dm9kt975b89i800,1.0,Horrible management that doesn’t stand up for their employees and break the rules to make the customer happy but if you make a mistake you get hours cut and a cold shoulder
PetSmart,1dm9gd4645n9r800,5.0,"the dogs are adorable.  Theres even a radio in the play room.  However, when I asked if I could do other things in the facility, like cut hair and give exit baths, they said yes.  However, they wouldn't let me out of the dog play area."
PetSmart,1dm9d9s9k5j5n804,4.0,"For starting out, it's a nice job to get, but there's not much longevity in it. The pay wasn't reflective on the amount of work I had to do, and the amount I was expected or even ask to do, beyond my regular line of work."
PetSmart,1dm7c4lv35ndt802,1.0,You can always find better and be more respected depending on the location you do go to people really didn’t get hours they deserve or wanted plus the people that was there longer got more hours
PetSmart,1dm7a5ku9b89i800,5.0,This was my second job and it was a fun one! I developed my customer service skill and had so much fun with all the animals. The hours were extremely flexible and it was interesting the things that you would learn.
PetSmart,1dm744nndh3kq801,1.0,"Typical environment of working for a company struggling to keep its head above water. Cutting hours every week yet piling on additional micro-managing tasks. The good management staff are constantly jumping ship for stable jobs, the bad are allowed to stick around because the company knows they can't keep good ones. Massive turnover of management and employees due to sour environment and constant hour cutting."
PetSmart,1dm6qq80tb81j801,3.0,Overall I exceeded in my job duties and did not receive job rasies or advancement opportunities within the company. I was front head of sales donations received and never received my raise that i was well deserved of that why i left and moved elsewhere but it slowly improved towards the of my job once we got new management in there.
PetSmart,1dm6osdu25j5n802,5.0,PetSmart culture is progressive and fun. Employees are upbeat and the business model is still dynamic and developing. Working with animals and team work minded people is common for the company.
PetSmart,1dm5fukm1b85i802,4.0,This job is very very stressfull. Have to be strong willed and able to work long periods if time. And be on your feet all day. This job is very hard on your body.
PetSmart,1dm55ee7dh3om800,1.0,I was hired on being told that I would have gotten to go to the grooming academy by January of 2019 every time it would get close to a time they said I would be going to the grooming academy they would tell me I can’t go to that one I will have to go to the next one.. there wasn’t enough advancement in pay I was only making ends meet because I was living with someone else who covered the bills
PetSmart,1dm53kvg4b89e802,4.0,The best part of my job is engaging with pets and their owners and sharing my knowledge with them to make the best decisions for the pet. The hardest part is lifting 50 lbs of dog food multiple times a day.
PetSmart,1dm3ktrc452tn800,5.0,Good company. I really like the animals and the people are thourough.The management have been patient with me and have opened me up a little. They have been good I just need Full Time .
PetSmart,1dm2lvfhvh3km802,3.0,At first the job was great they made lots of promises. There was advancement and it was quick depending on the worker. Over time however the promises made were taken away and management was rude and not great.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1dllc1fbvh3oh802,5.0,fun working with and educating the public about animals. enjoyed working getting cats adopted and into forever homes. Enjoyed connecting people to the correct accessories they needed to help care for their animals
PetSmart,1dlkqfd5lh3ki801,4.0,"It wasn't a bad place to work as far as retail it was as good as it gets. The upper management is hugely worried about statistics and surveys that the customer barely cares to give. Giving performance reviews and bonuses based on the survey performance, which a lot of people don't even take seriously. Most of the metrics there asking to do well in is depending on teenagers to be highly engaging and wanting to be a salesman, which in this generation is practically non-existent."
PetSmart,1dlke2jb8h3ki802,5.0,"I would not recommend this job for anyone that is looking for a full time career, there are not enough hours , and not enough pay. If you are straight out of high school this is perfect for you as they are flexible with your schedule, I now stock part time, managers are awesome and work with your schedule.Work is a little physical just make sure to get some sleep the night before , also the hours are usually 3-4am until open , we can wear whatever we want just as long as we are dressed by the time the store opens. Just work hard and be a good person and you will last here."
PetSmart,1dlk6r2boh3ki804,2.0,"If you're looking to work in the Wilmy area at PetSmart, I would suggest looking at the Mayfaire or Monkey Junction locations. The New Centre location is an absolute joke. Everyone is immature, irresponsible, and accountability is a joke. If you're okay working for a place that allows workers to kill animals with no repercussions, then this might be the place for you."
PetSmart,1dlipormo5ncm800,4.0,I love my particular location.  I work in the pet care department and have been there for 15 years.  I love educating people about animals and helping find the right pet for them.
PetSmart,1dlik4m3s24et000,4.0,The work was never difficult and often rewarding. The people were especially nice. Overall I would highly recommend this job as part-time work for anyone looking.
PetSmart,1dliguhv324gc000,3.0,"As a first job, it wasn't the greatest experience and there were some really stressful moments. I volunteered there for months before they hired me, it was extremely fast paced and management was harsh."
PetSmart,1dlibasdv24gt008,5.0,"I worked during the day when i first started it was one of my favorite places to work. I got to understand my own animal more because of me working around them. The hours werent bad, i can say all in all it is a great place to work. If they hire again i will apply."
PetSmart,1dli6su1t24fc002,5.0,I think this is a good job if you are just starting out in the pet food industry. Teaches good basic skills of how to work in a retail environment. Overall good job for young folk.
PetSmart,1dli576ld24ec000,2.0,great co workers . bad management .hope you like overtime .salary cap at 2 years. no job security. if you cant show up on time or work without calling off don't waste your time.
PetSmart,1dlhuolvq24gc008,4.0,"I was able to learn a lot of new things about animal care that prepared me for future jobs and medical services for animals, and the training was accurate to my job description."
PetSmart,1dlhpur675j4k804,3.0,"I love what I do but working in a corporate environment is terrible. They suck every little bit of your soul. They don't care about the employees. You are easily replaceable no matter how long you have been there for. They expect us to do a million different tasks while still making them a s**t ton of money and if we don't we get reprimanded. Salon management shouldn't even be considered management. No one likes being there. I love the actual work, grooming dogs and being around dogs is great. The salon is usually filled with drama, feels like I'm back in high school. Oh, and the pay isn't even that great."
PetSmart,1dlhpudhf5n8l801,3.0,"If you work in the daycare/hotel area it’s a really good job interacting with dogs all day long. I think the only thing I enjoyed about going to work was seeing all the dogs and taking care of them while they had fun with others. The only thing is the employees and management, they don’t care about your life outside of work even if you’re struggling to juggle parts of your life. I think management is poor throughout the whole store. There’s a lot of drama and  fake ness with the employees and managers. I don’t think they know how to really run a positive work environment."
PetSmart,1dlgs8skbb80h800,5.0,Pros outweigh the cons. Good benefits. Management inconsistent. Customers are generally loony. Too much drama in the salon. Too many rules back there as well. It killed our ability to do our jobs correctly and efficiently.
PetSmart,1dlgroavm24gt000,4.0,I come in and the the pallets are already there from the day before then I work them out based on what will go out fastest and it is very busy work not much time to not work.
PetSmart,1dlggka7b1d0e004,1.0,"Hours are inconsistent, poor management, not enough pay, retail is not a good environment, very demanding. Don't recommend it especially if you have a college degree"
PetSmart,1dlgal1he24gc000,3.0,"Ideal for a high school student, but they hire at 18. You must work full time if you’re looking to advanced, and they don’t pay well enough to make it work without a second job."
PetSmart,1dlg8is7c1fdu002,3.0,"I have been told I am extremely valuable and irreplaceable and yet still for nearly a year have only made minimum wage. Working harder than other associates proves to be of no reward, no advancement, or even a ten cent raise. It's a very fast-paced environment and of course it's retail, but its not worth it. Loved working here but absolutely never again."
PetSmart,1dlg6ri1e24gt000,4.0,I work in the grooming salon and it is very fast paced. But my coworkers are very nice and supportive. I recommend working here because the management is excellent and the people who work there are amazing.
PetSmart,1dlg030441fdu002,5.0,Awesome place to be if you love all types of animals and for those of you who have a problem with snakes and the like it is a good place to get rid of those phobias.

PetSmart,1dlfuq2kp24fc003,4.0,"I enjoyed my job, workplace and coworkers. The only issue I ever had was with management, they only care about money and it’s very easy for them to disrespect their associates."
PetSmart,1dlfk926124et000,3.0,"Advancement appears to be non existent thing new staff is not trained properly and learn while on the job, staff safety with animals and injuries should be coached when incidents happens what to properly do"
PetSmart,1dlfjhp2ub88g800,4.0,Liked grooming but company expect more work but they want safety doesn’t go hand in hand. You get November and December blackout time that you can’t take vacation which is not okay
PetSmart,1dlfeoem81fdu000,5.0,It was a great interview. Both people who interviewed me had lots of good questions on the task they would have me do. I didn’t feel nervous at all & was very excited to have the  opportunity
PetSmart,1dle7roj71fdu000,5.0,Petsmart is a great place to work.  Have to meet quota and production but overall its a great place. Awesome benefits and discounts. They have a great ping pong table area where you can enjoy your breaks at.
PetSmart,1dldubpmk5n8l800,1.0,"Poor management, understaffed all the time, staff not treated with respect, low pay, inconsistent hours and days, managers played favors with staff, treated poorly"
PetSmart,1dldq6e1524gt002,4.0,"a typical day a petsmart would include taking care of the shrink wrap, cardboard and trash. sometimes having to clean offices and bathrooms. I worked 12 hour days for 3 days then off four days. I was trained to operate a floor scrubber, pallet rider and a tugger."
PetSmart,1dldoa54h1fdu002,2.0,petsmart has good and bad points like any job the hours are bad usually only 16 hours a week for part timers no benefits unless your full time. The only good thing are the people you’ll work with and most leaders are completely useless the company itself isn’t bad it’s the store leaders that hold you back.
PetSmart,1dldbelhu24ec002,5.0,I really enjoy working at Petsmart! For myself I enjoy helping people find things for their pets. I mostly prefer when I am scheduled as petcare and do not like being cashier as much but I have been fine doing cashier. In petcare you have more freedom to roam around and keep busy. I wish there was more advancement for full time positions at the store im at though.
PetSmart,1dld59kj524ec000,2.0,"A typical day at work can be super stressful. The majority of the time you are working there you are usually understaffed, in my 2 years there was never a time where we were fully staffed. Even in the holiday season."
PetSmart,1dlcqdudr24fs000,4.0,"I really enjoyed working here for a short period of time, management was not the best. They consistantly were making our hours wrong. They had cut mine to 9 a week! It was impossible for me to go to work for 2 hours at a time for how far away from my home the business was at also as a dog trainer management was no help to me."
PetSmart,1dlbubb4i24ec002,4.0,Only downfall was that this oppurtunity was temporary and part time. Great work environment and great atmosphere at the time. If you expect a permanent job make sure before hiring on completely make sure its either temp or perm
PetSmart,1dlbema20b84i802,3.0,"Company overall good management?? Had good crew, good customer service,  handle inventory and as reset well, schedule was good flex hours full and part time"
PetSmart,1dlaut90v1fdu002,3.0,"In my opinion, Petsmart was not a good place to work at. You never really feel appreciated by management, customers are almost always rude, and they don't pay you enough for everything you do. Associates are the foundation of a store and Petsmart does not treat them as such."
PetSmart,1dlamikv724ec000,2.0,"fun to interact with diffent types of pets. can see anything from bearded dragons, to parrots, to puppies!"
PetSmart,1dla2mpdb24fs001,4.0,If you want to work in retail it’s a good place to be. Staff help each other in all departments. Only issue I had was with corporate wanting all bathers to be groomers and if you didn’t go through the training or declined they stopped putting you on the schedule. That’s how they weed people out. I wouldn’t consider it a secure job. Once I got a second job they stopped scheduling me.
PetSmart,1dl9h9cv424ec002,2.0,Managers will stalk social media pages of employees to see if they are hanging out with other employees out side of work environments. Will show favoritisms towards employees who have 0 motivation to help customers and management will confide with work drama and add to a underlining problem rather than fix the issue.
PetSmart,1dl8lj9e424fs000,3.0,"Some great managers, some terrible ones. Pay unfair: full-time as a manager I was making $14 an hour then I dropped down to part time after I had a baby and only made $10 an hour as a stocker. Then when I was ready to go back to management they could only pay me 15, although when I left, my assistant who didn’t know anything about my position was promoted to my spot and started at 1717"
PetSmart,1dl8l1cte1d0e001,5.0,After working for Petsmart for three years I am happy with my experience. At times the job is very demanding and it requires time and patience; yet the job is excellent and I’ve made great friends with my coworkers
PetSmart,1dl83f7ts5n8l800,4.0,"I was told that I was being considered for an open management opportunity, but they definitely took their time with it. It was about 4 months in that I was told that they were stringing me along so I would do management work, AND my regular work."

PetSmart,1dl5pjkrg0mt7001,3.0,"Generally a good management team, but location matters. Plenty of hypocritical corporate policies. Loved working with animals and helping people help their pets."
PetSmart,1dl5jq0kp24g6002,1.0,They are understaffed and force you to basically run the store if you’ve been there long enough. Doing cashier and pet care because nobody came in is typical and management would disappear into the back and count money. Terrible management. Coworkers were okay. Discount was okay.
PetSmart,1dl529h241fdo000,4.0,"I get $10.50 ($2 higher than the minimum wage for my state) an hour as a bather and doing the math I would take home around $10,000 a year after taxes… it’s a great job but you don’t get paid enough to live on. The average rent here is $1,100 and I come home with less than that every month. If you are a student who lives at home with their parents it’s a great setup for some pocket cash but if you have real bills to take care of I would suggest a different job."
PetSmart,1dl4sofn20mcn005,5.0,the store was very hectic. Managers didn’t communicate well with each other and their coworkers. Some managers were very lazy and most times wouldn’t even assist coworkers. They mostly have women so they’ll put them to do heavy lifting of dog or cat food instead of helping instead.
PetSmart,1dl4lr5f024em002,3.0,"Petsmart does not offer fulltime positions. Instead of hiring a hand full of qualified,  trained employees,  then allowing them to do their job. Compensating them accordingly.  Would rather hire part time , unskilled workers , paying them low wages with no benefits or vacations. Often short handed."
PetSmart,1dl4il6h61fdo002,5.0,Petsmart was a wonderful first time job for anyone needing experience with animals or retail. Depending on your position you get to work directly with the pets sold and assist pet parents in providing the proper care for their pets.
PetSmart,1dl42f8a91d0r000,3.0,I learned different things at Petsmart a typical day to wear the headsets sign in and wait for introductions pick a task finished and deliver and keep picking another task and depending of time some task take longer than other one
PetSmart,1dl3pb0g424g6004,3.0,"In the 10 years I have worked for the company, there have been ups and downs. Unfortunately, more downs than ups. The company is not family/home life oriented at all. You are reprimanded if you ever have to miss work. They do not reward much for the good things you do. There is a lot of bad things going on in the company."
PetSmart,1dl31vv3m24fm000,4.0,he did not care for the animals or to learn the managers names. He did not listen to staff. the company also added a lot of work load to their staff when they got bought out with out any more compensation.
PetSmart,1dl2f36ts0kbo004,5.0,A good solids day of work with great managers that trusted you to complete your work in an timely manner. Great co-workers that built a great support system.
PetSmart,1dl28md550mto002,4.0,It was a great experience. I learned so much about all the animals and the best types of food to feed them. Everyone was super nice and helpful and were patient while I was learned the ropes.
PetSmart,1dl1h1ph91d0r000,4.0,"I like working at the pet hotel, but I can't ever complete my duties due to being so understaffed. The closing always disregards the amount pf work that I have to do."
PetSmart,1dl195rrj1fdi002,1.0,Management at this store was not the best.  Employees were spoken to poorly and the moral was not great during the time I was employed there.  I hope they have improved as it was very discouraging at the time.
PetSmart,1dl0r3msn1d0h004,3.0,"It was a great place to work a few years ago, but has really dropped off on the last couple years. Management has little to no training on how to do their jobs and the company as a whole is very against maintaining the store equipment, so the older stores really show the wear."
PetSmart,1dl0o6u3u24f1000,5.0,"Working at PetSmart was a good job because you were surrounded by good coworkers and a different types of animals. I also loved being able to help pet parents when they had questions, to be able to point them in the right direction."
PetSmart,1dktkqifr1d11000,4.0,The staff is good and the benefits are good. the culture is good. I love working as a team in my department. I help when he fish come in from the airport at times and I also help in shipping the fish when we are through picking them.
PetSmart,1dktbqecf24gh000,2.0,"The more I stayed the more I realized that as a corporation all they pushed for was over working their employees and, expecting to much of them with no options for overtime and no time for lunches. They'll hire just about anyone to fill a position but never fire anyone for not doing their job. advancement is an option for you however you'll never get recognized for doing your every day duties. PS doesn't train you on any animal care they just hand you a paper of how to care or the animals at home and expect you to learn the rest on your own."
PetSmart,1dksvs22m0mch001,4.0,"I tried to apply for a differemt job but at the moment they medded help with bather, in the end it was a good experience people was nice amd they were patient with me i was able to learn pretty quick thank to the saloon groomer. I recomend tis job only for those who enjoy working with pets."
PetSmart,1dksbsvb724fh000,5.0,I had so much fun working at PetSmart. If there was one closer in my area I would still be working for the compan! You can learn all about great deals and help pet owners find amazing food or treats even toys for their pets. Plus the outfits are amazing!
PetSmart,1dkra3cjk24f1000,3.0,My team was amazing and was having the animals around all day is always a bonus. Some other management was not open to new ideas and not as hands-on  as I would expect.

The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1dkr9mtvb0mth001,3.0,"This job was great for a short time. However, it was not the best place to work. The hours were long and the pay is ok. It is a great summer or college job but it is not a job for the long term."
PetSmart,1dkqppftr24fh002,4.0,Decent place to work easy work just quick paced great incentives easy to move around great warehouse vibe great vending machine choices the harder you work the more you get paid
PetSmart,1dkpgjmtv1d11000,4.0,"PetSmart gives a lot of opportunities to expand knowledge with several types of animals, as well as gives incredible opportunities for advancement. PetSmart tries to promote from within and will give a current employee a chance for an advanced position before interviewing outside applicants."
PetSmart,1dkp2fmkb24f1000,5.0,I worked at Petsmart for a year and I have to say everyone was very nice and I was made welcomed into the Petsmart company very quickly. I interacted with all of my associates and with the customers that they came back for more.
PetSmart,1dknv7cj324e1002,4.0,I love my job at the Pets Hotel. I was easily able to climb the ladder and became an Assistant manager within the first year of me working there. I love the clients that come and their pets. I have a super flexible schedule and am able to go to school full time while working full time. I get great health benefits and paid time off.
PetSmart,1dkn5oceg24e1000,4.0,Overall I really enjoy working for the company but my main issue is lack of advancement when frequently told that I would make a perfect manager and knowing that they have a position open for what I would be placed into.
PetSmart,1dklqrfjr0mt1000,1.0,Managers will talk badly about coworkers in front of customers and people who do not need to hear it. If you have emergencies they are petty about you having to leave or call out.
PetSmart,1dkll3v4m24eh002,5.0,This company was great to work for with many opportunities to move up in the company.  They take care of their full time employees and offer an ok benefits package.
PetSmart,1dklgfp5024e1002,3.0,"They're a corporation, you know? They're about quantity over quality and it shows once you start working in the grooming salon. It's a pretty stressful environment and you have little control over anything"
PetSmart,1dkl4gisc24f1000,5.0,"Working at petsmart is amazing, with the right team you learn so much knowledge about the food they sell, brands they offer and about the pets!"
PetSmart,1dkka1vg21fdi002,3.0,"The store I worked at in Phoenix was awesome! The staff all worked together great. When I moved to the store in Suerra Vusta I felt unwelcome and unwanted from the moment I walked in. The grooming staff was awesome, and most of the floor staff was nice, but the upper management treated me like dirt. I was never fully trained for the position they put me in at the Sierra Vista store, and every time I asked for help I would get ignored. I would get in trouble everytime I would ask for time off to travel to see family,and got denied many days off to the point where they forced me to just call in sick so I could take a day."
PetSmart,1dkk6bllq1fdi004,2.0,"PetSmart is focused on sales, sales of products and services for pets, dogs, cats, birds and reptiles. They have a good variety of mid-priced products."
PetSmart,1dkk02g1s24g1002,2.0,Most managers were poor and unfit to be in the positions they were in. An image of being pet motivated people is set throughout interviews and training but it is seen through work there that the company doesn't care for its animals much. Do not work there if animal death will heavily effect Not the hardest job i've had but communication is lacking between managers and workers.
PetSmart,1dkjttp4o24gh000,4.0,"I started off as a bather in the grooming salon in May of 2013 and after about six months I had graduated from their grooming academy training program, and began working full-time. I started earning commission by January of 2014, which is 50% per dog groomed. We were encouraged to upsell products, which was easy and to build a consistent clientele by calling customers for reminders and handing out our cards. I worked in Tomball, so we really had to hustle on that front as business was a bit slower due to large number of mobile grooming businesses and other independently owned boarding places and vet offices in the area. Other salons (suburban/inner city area) are regularly fully booked, no questions asked. I appreciated the opportunity to learn a new skill and the supportive company culture."
PetSmart,1dkhkc4lf24fr000,5.0,"The only downside to petsmart was that they pay was not enough, otherwise I loved my experience. Working with my team and managers was a awesome experience."
PetSmart,1dkhiodpuh3oh800,5.0,I loved working here. I actually really miss it a lot. If I could I would go back to working here. But I'm in school now. I may reapply in a couple of months.
PetSmart,1dkhic3sib85q802,1.0,Poor pay. Your pay won't go up if they increase the stores starting pay
PetSmart,1dkh8229v52sv802,2.0,"As a petcare employee who usually worked opening shifts, my typical workday involved feeding animals, cleaning entire habitats (one set of habitats per day, e.g. small animals, birds, etc), and scrubbing fish tanks; additionally I was responsible for helping customers once the store was open, with anything from general advice to fulfilling a shopping list to selling animals. I did learn a lot working there, but it was extremely demanding, with upper management continually expecting more and more work done in a shorter amount of time, which inevitably (and unfortunately) leads to poorer care for the animals. Managers were generally unthankful and unsympathetic, and paid little or no attention to actual quality of care provided but only to deadlines being met. The hardest part of the job was by far the frustration at not having enough time to really do the job right every day."
PetSmart,1dkh6t4mmb85q800,4.0,"A great place to work, but the corporate office is pushing the line when it comes to safety where the hotel is concerned. A lot of the recent changes have been monetarily motivated, and will have a negative impact on the pets staying there"
PetSmart,1dkh3nsmib85q801,1.0,"Working at PetSmart was enjoyable in the beginning until management went downhill. Only one manager was amazing, however she alone could not create a good working atmosphere when all other managers would create drama or did not do any work themselves and just talked amongst themselves."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1dkh0vm1vb85q802,5.0,Being a stocker for Petsmart is definitely a competitive job.  It is a race against the clock every single morning.  Employees must be able to lift more than 50lbs at a time and be able to pay close attention to details.
PetSmart,1dkgf2d9s52sv802,5.0,"I love animals so this was a great experience. An easy job for me to do! I shampooed, clipped nails and groomed dogs. I also helped schedule appointments and kept the salon clean."
PetSmart,1dkg29qjg24go000,3.0,"Challenging place to work. Assisting parents find their child's first pet, assisting customers maintain and care for their furrry friends, Petsmart is the leader in the pet industry and their company standards set the bar for others in the industry."
PetSmart,1dkenm8fo5nb4800,3.0,I wouldnt change a thing about my career so far. My time with petsmart was great. I appreciate everything that company did for me. They put me through grooming school not only for free but paid me for it. My problem with them really started when the ownership changed and it started feeling like I mattered less and the quality and care mattered less than the money made.msdOther than
PetSmart,1dkehohi9b85q800,4.0,"Would recommend as a side job for a student or teen or someone on there way to retirement. Decent job fun and the pets were obviously amazing! Management was decent, over all culture is decent."
PetSmart,1dkec92rj24go001,4.0,Everyone is very kind to each other and to the customers and willing to help each other. Seeing the smiling faces of pet parents after they pick up their dogs from the salon was always my favorite part of my day.
PetSmart,1dke115s95j64802,4.0,"Store leader works with you the best she can. Working with the animals is great. Typical customer service job. Expect the usual when handling animals. I.e. being licked by dogs, hamsters and other small animals can bite, cats can claw, and fish will get you wet. So long as you follow the set safety standards and basic understanding of animals you'll have a good time working there"
PetSmart,1dkdtr0ph24go002,1.0,"Do not work here if you care about animals! Management is terrible. Do not expect them to work around your availability, they will schedule you times you can’t work. If you want to work more than 12 hours a week don’t expect it from them. Management has no respect for employees. They all claim to care about animals but do not give them adequate living conditions and most wind up dead. Honestly the worst job I have ever had."
PetSmart,1dkdt6t5eh3kh800,1.0,"Very poor management, abuse/ neglect of animals, very great coworkers but a lot of unnecessary drama. Very little pay/ reward for all of the hard work associates put in."
PetSmart,1dkdr09jdb81o800,5.0,Petsmart is an excellent company with amazing managers. This is by far my favorite job / work environment and there are many opportunities to move up.
PetSmart,1dkdmnag7b89b802,4.0,Everyone is nice and greets you kindly but as the day gets busy it seems everyone looses that kind greeting and becomes less friendly when in fast paced and high stress situations.
PetSmart,1dkdgismi52sv800,4.0,"Management was fairly absent and detached when it came to understanding employees. (This was at a location that no longer exists). Coworkers were awesome. Teamwork was excellent, we all helped and respected each other. I also helped with stocking and at Banfield. (I worked primarily in the Salon). Cant say enough about how much I miss that job."
PetSmart,1dkd35n0qh3kh802,3.0,Not a bad place to start out at if you are new to the working world. Not the highest pay and no benefits unless you are in management as well no paid vacation but the job had a lot of learning experience for me and was a good introduction to the work field when I was 18 years old.
PetSmart,1dkcctkbih3hr800,5.0,Very friendly associates
PetSmart,1dkbsia7mb85o800,1.0,"Some stores are apparently better, but the district I worked in drilled it home to me that my words didn't matter, I was spending every day fighting against the company, and customers didn't know who to trust."
PetSmart,1dkbqk5e1h3kg804,3.0,"Fast paced, hard grunt work in a pet hotel. Pay and benefits weren't that bad for retail. You do have to work on Xmas and Thanksgiving. Can be stressful."
PetSmart,1dkbn5shub81m802,4.0,"it's good, not a whole lot of place to or room to grow. They work with you school schedule. A whole lot of monthly store changes as well as inventory management"
PetSmart,1dka2n7klbre4801,3.0,"Unsupportive management styles. From top down, there is no support for management. Work is demanded outside of scheduled hours. Work-Life balance is nonexistent."
PetSmart,1dk99jd68h3kg80a,2.0,"I was excited to work here, they seemed great, the store manager was great, the other mangers were pretty fair too. Then I started working there and the atmosphere was so rude. A lot of gossiping, catty, rude women just being nasty in every way. I was a new bather and apparently a lot of the groomers didn't ""like"" new bathers and were not kind at all. I thought it was just me, but nos there were a couple of other bathers that got hired after I had been there for a while and they were treated all the same. You only ever get a break when you become a groomer or if you come into it as a groomer. The managers didn't care, HR didn't care, and because they didn't like me, despite me being a good bather (to my knowledge), I got bullied out."
PetSmart,1dk98tfvkh3og802,4.0,Great entry level job and a fun place to go everyday.  People are kind and welcoming. Offered great training and opportunities to change positions. Pet friendly place.

PetSmart,1dk8qhoc05nb3803,2.0,Managers are decent to work for just pay sucks. When I was hired I worked early mornings but decided I wasn’t paid enough to be waking up that early so I stopped.
PetSmart,1dk6vt8o4b81m802,3.0,"Life at PetSmart prior to going Private was fun but we all worked hard and believed in what we did. After the sale, it was a transactional relationship with lack of strong leadership that lead through fear. PetSmart lost it’s identity."
PetSmart,1dk6opak95nb3800,4.0,"Overall I enjoyed working for PetSmart the issues I did face was due to Management. I, at first had an awesome work environment and team. Due to a few health setbacks I was forced to quit through a FMLA leave."
PetSmart,1dk6i0kvkb898805,2.0,"Everyone was extremely negative. No matter the day or time of day is was just people complaining about misery constantly. Now, I'm not trying to say whether it was right or wrong to complain about the situation. But it was very depressing as a result. That was my biggest take away. And with most low paying jobs management was terrible and you always felt overworked."
PetSmart,1dk50f68ih3og802,3.0,fun place to work but stressful and hard work
PetSmart,1dk4u7b0m5nb3802,3.0,The job gets harder to do as time goes on because hours are dwindling leaving managers and associates to do far more work that is possible to do. The company desires more customer engagement but still requires very task heavy daily responsibilities but they will not allow for more hours.
PetSmart,1dk3q4hvth3hr802,3.0,"Enjoy what I do but poor management and high stress levels are a big factor .  Low staff all the time , not proper training the last couple years , have to answer phones while grooming dogs and do walk ins ."
PetSmart,1dk3ibist5nfm800,5.0,Working for petsmart is great. Everyone i worked for and with there was so nice and understanding. I would definitively reccomend working at petsmart to anyone who loves working with animals.
PetSmart,1dk3i5qpdb85o800,5.0,"The management is very helpful and considerate. I enjoy my coworkers and working there. I can without a doubt say they are an amazing company to work for. While customer service can seem tedious at times, I know my coworkers will help me feel better if I deal with an abrasive customer."
PetSmart,1dk3donkkh40l800,3.0,"Some aspects of working at PetSmart are really great. I have learned to be the best possible pet parent I can be, and I love that. I know so much about food, litter, etc. that I likely wouldn't have learned otherwise. It's also a huge relief to be able to spend my days with coworkers who care about animals as much as I do. I would also note that management at this location is very good about working with your non-PetSmart schedule. So if you've got school, another job, or just a life to live in general, they're good about giving you the space for those other things. Plus, you also earn vacation and sick time-- not a ton as a part-timer, but it's something."
PetSmart,1dk2eeoudh3hr800,5.0,This was as great job. I worked there for a year and would still be there if health issues hadn't come up. The only issue is there isn't a lot of areas of advancement.
PetSmart,1dk27k5g25j63800,2.0,all I have to say is over time this company has gone down I love what I do but I can’t wait till I no longer have to do it for petsmart management sucks at my location and the communication is worst and it starts from the top
PetSmart,1dk1kd59424gn000,1.0,"The biggest pros to working in the hotel is the opportunity to see, care for and educate yourself and pet parents on the variety of animal care during their stay.There's little room for advances. Pay will stay very stagnant and staff is very underpaid. Management has huge favoritism that is very similar to high school drama. The facility is extremely understaffed causing 1-2 people to walk/feed over 90 dogs by themselves in a short span. Management blames higher management that they won't staff more so they can get bonuses. Management gloats about their higher pay but is rarely even their, even at big supporting events. There is a 'care' line to call but it always gets hushed down the line and the hotel manager to take care of it so it doesn't go to upper management and then the employees always get reprimanded for calling. The manager would rather put multiple animals in danger rather then sticking to policy to appease a single pet parent. Fellow employees are very snarky and would leave or ignore duties they didn't want to do to other employees even in serious matters. You are constantly told not to go over 40 hours but are being called and thrown around a schedule all the time. You never have a consistent schedule as it changes weekly."
PetSmart,1dk1ihqav5nb3801,5.0,Great place to grow within the business. Plenty of growth at PetSmart. A company who cares about what the employees think. Best retail store I ahve worked at.
PetSmart,1dk1gplv8b81m804,5.0,Always a great day at work. Great place to work if you love animals. Everyone was passionate and hard working. Friendly environment. Room for advancement. Great management!
PetSmart,1dk1c0p5k24fq000,4.0,Training was thorough and staff is very welcoming. management was understanding and trained all staff to their highest potential. the room for growth was clear and offered opportunity.
PetSmart,1dk16ar1hbre4801,5.0,Working at pet smart was really a enjoyable experience.  I got to work close with animals and any time I felt stuck or needed assistance a fellow employee was ready and eager to help. The staff was like a family to eachother it made it a very safe and comfy place to be.
PetSmart,1dk0tc5d424gn002,4.0,They teach you basic retail skills and more. They great when i comes to scheduling they are very understanding that you have a life outside of work and that many of their employees go to school as well.
PetSmart,1dk0ov1tob81m802,3.0,Corporate  has no ideal what happens at the store level. Expectations are to the extreme.  Company has had to make extreme cuts in the last few years  due to internet companies and online ordering. That does not leave enough staff or time to complete tasks that are to be completed.  If you dont mind half ASSing your job because you dont have time then this is the job for you.
PetSmart,1dk0nohfq24fq001,5.0,The past 7 years I have worked for Petsmart has been fun and rewarding. I appreciate everything the company does to help their employees with any needs they may have.

PetSmart,1djvu93fd24es000,3.0,work there if you enjoy animals. I was a groomer for 3 yrs and t was a great career to have and I made life long friends. a lot has changed since I worked there tho.
PetSmart,1djvrfkihb892802,5.0,Super friendly and helped me learn how to adapt and work as a cashier! If I needed help they didn't hesitate to come over and help me with any questions.
PetSmart,1djvk6j93b892801,5.0,You have to have a great deal with pets and pet parents I love it.... I switched to grooming and so far I'm having a good time everyone is so sweet!! Great job!!!
PetSmart,1djvj0iau5nav800,5.0,I’ve worked for PetSmart for 5 years the first 4 years was rough Management wasn’t great then they ALL got replaced now it’s probably the best place to work!
PetSmart,1djvavdc2h3hn804,1.0,Don't explain job description changes
PetSmart,1djv9u4u2h3hn800,5.0,"I enjoy the environment in PetSmart, everyone is friendly and willing to help. Management sees potential in its employees and likes to provide small prizes for encouragement to keep up the good work. The store is filled with so many pets including cats and dogs."
PetSmart,1djv9kub824fc002,5.0,"To many policies that don't make sense, loved working with the animals and the people, great benefits, would work there any time again, the new store manager is great"
PetSmart,1djv3lda224gj000,1.0,They weren't friendly and they fired over a manager making a suspicious decision on a receipt return. The hours were randomly assigned any where from 8am-1pm or 5pm-10pm
PetSmart,1djufnm9f5nfh800,4.0,"Good place to work when you love animals but as all retain places, you are asked to do too much with too few people and not enough time given."
PetSmart,1dju11g9q24gj005,4.0,"Working at Petsmart is sometimes busy, usually cut back depending on how you handle customers. Learning how to complete inventory, operate the cash register, reordering shelves, and fully stocking."
PetSmart,1dju0tpkm5nav800,1.0,Awful management and team
PetSmart,1djthrbs724es000,5.0,"Fast paced,group effort, the manager was very respectful along with staff it only took seconds too learn the routine work so production  could go up and we could get raises. Even though I am a texan I enjoyed working in phoenix at petsmart."
PetSmart,1djt9meak24fc000,1.0,Loved the job..hated the management..very hard work..zero recognition..horrible pay..very discom obulated. I called corporate for help..recieved nothing.
PetSmart,1djsimsb4b892804,4.0,"Cross trained for cashier, stocker and dog bather but wasn’t properly cross trained in order. New employees were hired with a pay grade higher than my pay and other employees pay, also cross trained faster than I was. Somewhat favoritism in the work place. Enjoyed being around all the animals. Somewhat competitive for sales and email capture that would affect work schedules as well (favoritisms)"
PetSmart,1djsad25pbre0800,5.0,"It is nice to work for the company because you get to interact with animals constantly and you get a discount for your animals. The hardest part about this job is whenever you see customers bring in animals that are obviously not treated properly, but you cannot really do anything about it."
PetSmart,1djs6a1qjb81i802,4.0,"Fast paced, calm work environment. Management is understanding and down to earth. Petsmart is a great place to work part time or full time. The customers are very nice aswell."
PetSmart,1djs32c2i5nav800,5.0,It was a very fun place to work. I don’t regret it at all. I enjoy going to work all the time. It’s good if you need a part time job and a relaxed environment.
PetSmart,1djroo9j15nfh800,1.0,"I only worked at Petsmart for a short period of time , but I cannot say there was any sort of workplace culture. As a cashier the main duty is to process customer purchases, return items and process pet salon vouchers."
PetSmart,1djqp2hlo24fm000,1.0,I worked under the area Dog Trainer and was part time. I was told initially that I would be mostly selling/teaching classes with a little time on the register.  That was completely false. I was mostly on register with very few hours to sell and only 1 hour a week to train. Even with my “training time” I was still expected to be on call with the register. Management was also VERY hostile. My advice would be do the training to become a trainer teach 1 class then quit. That’s the only benefit to this job.
PetSmart,1djpthrhc5j5v803,4.0,"I enjoyed helping the pet parents work out the issues with their dogs & finding the right products they needed for any pet in their home.   it was a 2nd job, so sometimes it was a bit tiring after already working a full 8 hours"

PetSmart,1dje6tq6t5n9i802,4.0,"The work you do is mostly just common sense stuff. Once you know how to do it it's just the same every day so it gets a bit monotonous. The best part is you get to hang out with animals though, so thats nice."
PetSmart,1dje5jjj7b80q801,2.0,Typical day was feeding cleaning walking dogs load play rooms quickly. return pets quickly. Everything done at a fast paced so quality of work lacked. Some people worked harder than others. No formal training just how to clean cages and rooms and how to do feedings.  Physically demanding job
PetSmart,1dje1kknjh47j800,3.0,"Workplace culture is stressful and feels like corporate is constantly breathing down your neck. Feels less geared towards helping customers and more towards selling, selling, selling, rather than a fair balance of both."
PetSmart,1djd8nvsmh3nt800,5.0,PetSmart is a great place to work. They are flexible with hours and really find a schedule that works for you and them. I started off As a PetCare Soecialist and now I am a dog bather working up to grooming. I loved everything I did in petcare! Taking care of all the animals and helping pet parents get the accurate information. I cross trained in grooming and found my passion.
PetSmart,1djd20bkp52v1801,3.0,"After a week, I called the store manager about the hiring process and was willing to interview me in a couple days later. At the day of the interview, I was both excited and nervous because I feared that they won’t hired me but ended up getting hired on the spot. After training week, they put me on the schedule but had me for only 3 days. They didn’t give me another position neither work around school schedule so they ended up terminated my employment."
PetSmart,1djcvekl95j4n801,3.0,Safety first !! They are being on being safe and following the processes for accurate picking of product. The employees are closely knit together and make the day go by
PetSmart,1djcc4fqsh3nt804,4.0,"I enjoyed my time at Petsmart, however, the company was starting to have more unrealistic expectations of the management teams. The internal audits held you to an almost unreacheable standard. When I talk to friends still working there, I am told that it has only gotten worse."
PetSmart,1dja2jkbo1d1c000,3.0,"Work environment was terrible and there was nothing you could do to fix it. Unprofessional, and just stressful. Some people would just stand around and do nothing while others worked there butt off. You’d have 6 people on a shift and only two are actually working"
PetSmart,1dja1kb2jh3vp802,3.0,"Not a bad job to work while in school, but the pay was low for the expectations. If you get good hours it can be worth it, but as a Pet Care Associate you are responsible for all the animals and it can be very stressful."
PetSmart,1dja1all3h47j800,5.0,"Since I am a pet trainer, my typical day at work starts with calling my pet parents, getting ready for the day's classes, editing my class schedule, general cashier help and customer service within the store, and finally teaching the classes scheduled."
PetSmart,1dj8dkti0h3r3800,2.0,Stressful workplace with small amount of hours and little pay. Decline in hours and not secure with this job at all. Unable to depend on hours with debt and other payments. Not enough to survive on that makes it highly stressful on top of everything else.
PetSmart,1dj88dfiph46t800,2.0,PetSmart is a vert stressful place to work. Management is always changing policies due to corporate. The interviews lie about the difficulty of the job. The company does not pay fairly or recognize hard work. No one will advance in the company by traditional methods.
PetSmart,1dj85q7g5h46t802,4.0,"Overnights were more difficult I think because of the lack of employees, there were usually only 2 of us and our job requirements were to clean the entire back area ( mop floors, do laundry, clean out dog cages as needed, and play rooms). Also had to feed all the dogs and bring them out for 2 group playtimes towards the morning."
PetSmart,1dj85elquh3v0802,2.0,"Working here started off wonderful. I enjoyed my duties, taking care of the animals always put a smile on my face and informing customers about the animals we carried was enjoyable. However, after a few months, it quickly turned sour. You learn fast that management plays favorites all the time. It is reflected in the way they treat you and on the schedule with how many hours you receive. If you call off even once you're no longer special to them. The pay is fair however I worked there for over a year and never received a yearly review or raise. Their turnover rate is also extremely high, in my last couple of weeks there at least 5 of my coworkers quit. The district manager doesn't care about the quality of care for the animals and is more focused on the customer service survey scores more than anything else. Overall I wouldn't recommend working here at all."
PetSmart,1dj7o2g5fbrcm800,4.0,I would sat that it was very entertaining working here but the management wasn't good at all. They were very hard on their employees and yelled a lot.
PetSmart,1dj7kjedm52tn800,4.0,Overall working at PetSmart was a good experience I left to go work for a friend of mine who owns his own company then I left there to remain an operations manager at angels and arrows...
PetSmart,1dj7emuvhb8bm800,2.0,"Every individual store has different management so I can’t speak for them all, but the three stores I worked at had managers that liked to contribute to drama in the work place and definitely played favorites."
PetSmart,1dj6noco952tn800,4.0,"Started as an overnight pet care and moved to a Senior Petshotel Associate over the course of my time. Overall I really enjoyed working for the company. When they were bought out, I didn't enjoy it as much, but I worked to care for the animals and that made it better. Like any job, there was stress and toxicity but management handled it if brought to their attention."
PetSmart,1dj6f61hc1d0b000,3.0,Must have sales experience. Requires ability to stand for long periods of time. I do not feel the staff for pet care was adequately trained and animals were not properly taken care of.
PetSmart,1dj679snobrcm802,4.0,"Overall, it's an enjoyable job. You get to see many pets and chat with their pet parents. Most customers are friendly and just enjoy talking about their animals. The store can get busy around holidays, especially at the pets hotel (if the location has one). Even when part time, you can be scheduled for nearly 40 hours (Or more!) during the busiest times of the year, depending on staff numbers, so that can be an inconvenience to some people (again, specifically in the pets hotel)."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1dj4vjk3s0mcg002,3.0,Good place to work. Everyone is nice and friendly. Management trys to work with you on the work schedules. But only management gets fulltime hours and benefits unless your friends.  Wink ;) ;) Wink
PetSmart,1dj4v2sbcb8bm802,2.0,"Management is lacking. Early morning stocking is easy but during the day you are required to sell coupon books and training classes and whatever else is chosen as important at the time, with little incentive to do so. I worked at stores that were great and the people supported each other but I've worked for other petsmarts that were every person for themselves kind of places. Customers can range from pleasant and fun to talk with to Yelling in your face because you are out of shredded turkey cat food. You do get to see animals everyday and full time benefits are nice. How much you enjoy your job, workplace culture, and typical day entirely depend on how good your management team is."
PetSmart,1dj4rokc3h46t802,3.0,As long as you get a store with good management to back you and do there part it's a great place to work. It emotionally got difficult working with the pets for me though.
PetSmart,1dj3qiv86h3gh800,4.0,"So far from when I started working PetSmart I was happy I loved going to work because the pay  was better than my last job ,everyday I learn something different, management was something else mangers will always get fire so it’s was always different , depends where you work at ,its not a bad place to work if you’re trying to balance school and work very flexible with that and very helpful too"
PetSmart,1dj2kmng75ndc801,4.0,"The work itself can be challenging, but it is very informative. I have picked up new and dynamic skills in pet care and customer service. The culture itself is refreshing, new and exciting."
PetSmart,1dj1q5mkfb8bm800,4.0,"Just as with most businesses, hard work, dedication, and integrity are rewarded. Do your job as prescribed and be consistent, and you will do very well with this company."
PetSmart,1dj16bga81d0n002,1.0,"Overall...absolutely awful company. Poor management, no standards, no concern for the wellbeing of employees. Ridiculously high turn over and they will hire anyone."
PetSmart,1dj0lcisv52tn800,5.0,Great place to work. Good people. Fair salary and benefits. Love animals. Fun events. Customers can be difficult. Good chance for advancement  if you work hard.
PetSmart,1dj0c3r7th3v0802,5.0,Management and co workers were very easy to work with. PetSmart wasn't a stressful work place. the most enjoyable part about working at PetSmart was meeting new people and learn new techniques to better improve my job performants.
PetSmart,1dj01ugdbh46t802,4.0,"Depending on locations differs the environment. Owasso was very stressful and test your patience with rude customers. Tho owasso was more fast paced and day went by faster, the store needs a whole new UPDATE. Broken arrow has more nice customers  that are pleasant to advise on pet needs. Broken arrow equipment is more nice also."
PetSmart,1divtiib2brcm802,1.0,I don't know that all petsmarts are bad. However I do know the one in Manteca has managers who honestly don't care about the workers just about the money that goes in their pocket.
PetSmart,1divnq5cph3v0801,1.0,When I started working for Petsmart it was a great company. New ownership has ruined that.  It’s now another example of rich executives trying to get richer by overworking and undercutting their staff.  The rats are starting to abandon the sinking ship. And those of us who work for Petsmart know that rats are very intelligent industrious animals.
PetSmart,1diu3u1i3h46t800,4.0,They were a great set of people to work with. The animals there were fun. Petsmart is a great job to work at if you looking for something easy and flexible.
PetSmart,1diu2gc4d0mcg000,3.0,All in all if PetSmart compensated better I would have stayed with the company to grow and gain experience with. They had a good work environment and made me feel at home at times
PetSmart,1ditttaf0brcm805,3.0,"Through working at Petsmart, I got to experience a large variety of different dog and cat breeds and behaviors. Sometimes it was wonderful, other times it was stressful. It's fulfilling to work with the dogs and I made some lasting friendships with coworkers and pet parents alike. Plus, close contact with animals!"
PetSmart,1diteu000h3gh802,4.0,"I loved working with animals and learning about a llot more products and animals. The only downside to this job is not getting enough hours, unless the store is really understaffed. I also wish there were more opportunities for full time positions. I did enjoy the 15% employees discount + 50% discount on Petsmart exclusive brands!"
PetSmart,1ditc1ba8h3r3800,2.0,"The workplace is slow-paced for the most part, except on weekends when the store is really busy. It is a team-oriented workplace where you are constantly communicating through radios to managers and pet care associates."
PetSmart,1dis04lse0mte002,1.0,You need to make sure you dont give up having a personal life for them. things change alot so dont get comfortable. higher management is not with you they go against you.
PetSmart,1dirugpkmh3gh802,1.0,"Working here was not only severely stressful trying to make sure that customers were satisfied, but it was severely frustrating having to deal with some of the staff and management. It’s hard to get hours as a part-time worker, you be lucky to even get between 10-20 hours per week."
PetSmart,1dirobdsuh3r3802,1.0,Work here if you
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1dirl5fptb8bm802,4.0,"I started with a less than awesome boss, but he promoted me twice and gave me compensation that was more than fair. I have a new boss now, and he's the best. Awesome coworkers!"
PetSmart,1dir8ih8j0mcg006,3.0,"At PetSmart I was a senior pet care associate, my main responsibilities were the well-being of all the animals sold at the store. The care consisted of feeding watering and a general health check of all animals on the floor including rodents, birds, reptiles, and fish. I also completed nightly checks on any sick or injured animals and administered medication."
PetSmart,1diqm311i1d0b000,1.0,Positive: It’s something that pays the bills (hopefully you don’t have many) until you get a good job. You don’t have to work there much because you won’t get more than 18 hours a week. Dogs on Saturday.
PetSmart,1diqc22pth3gh806,4.0,"Pros: Very lax job if part time. Easy to learn, Can listen to headphones, Responsibilities rarely change. Virtually no traffic if an opener."
PetSmart,1diq6vlrbh3n0802,1.0,"Bad co-workers I was very uncomfortable,they made me feel lile I wasn't ment it I be there as a groomer like I was some joke ,I feel like I wasn't seen as an equal"
PetSmart,1dipalhni5ndc802,3.0,"Very High stress, extremely fast paced, very competitive, with room for advancement. Not a bad environment If you and your co workers are a team and get along."
PetSmart,1dio7hl8jh3gh802,5.0,"i handle dogs all day long, which is very physically exhausting, but satisfactory if you are the type of person that likes  dogs a lot. it can be a gross job but once again a fun environment"
PetSmart,1dio4qqgih3r3803,5.0,Everyone I work with are amazing. Managed very well. Would like more hours. I enjoy working with all the animals there. I feel I have grow great relationships with the people I work with and it’s a very team oriented job.
PetSmart,1dio4kre6h3n0803,4.0,"Was excited to work here beforehand. Though I tried my hardest as the only Early AM Stocker in the store, it got to be too much for me when I would get in 4 truckloads of items at 7AM and would have to be done by 10AM with unloading and stocking BY MYSELF. They didn't want to hire any help for me, and when I couldn't make a certain deadline for unloading and stocking, I was sent home for the day, and that would cut into my pay. Became a nightmare!"
PetSmart,1dinevvacb8bm802,2.0,There is a lot of bullying and clicks there is alot of young people working there so if you not in your 20s you wont fit in I worked grave and days and had alot of issues being bullyed cuz I am 35
PetSmart,1dimlvsbsb83s802,4.0,As a whole PetSmart is a fun place to work at. They do a lot of Family stuff. You can bring your dog to work. They give away a lot of free stuff. Free food at times. People here are happy and love there job.
PetSmart,1dillt153h3mq802,1.0,"My experience as a bather at petsmart was miserable and physically damaging. Despite telling my supervisor multiple times that I was being pushed too hard physically, I was told multiple times that I just had to keep doing the amount of work that I was doing. They were desperately understaffed and since I was the ONLY bather at the time, they wanted me to bathe as many dogs as possible.  I was still experiencing numbness and pain in my hands two weeks after quitting. These people did not care about my physical or emotional well-being and just wanted to grind as much work out of me as possible."
PetSmart,1dilfjdo7h435802,5.0,Petz pets more pets feeding training and being a cahsier and seeing people and loving my job love animals helping them givong them treats and having a great boss.. Loved it
PetSmart,1dikucetbh46o800,2.0,"The schedule is great (3 days a week for 12 hours a day) but it’s constant drama and management is never satisfied with a your numbers, along with this you’re given unrealistic goals to meet and management will openly admit that they’re unrealistic but still take disciplinary action. I would recommend this job because it pays well and as long as you can ignore management it’s not a huge deal but I personally enjoy job security so it wasn’t for me."
PetSmart,1dijvs2e6h3qs800,3.0,"Working at petsmart was okay. Not a very exciting place to be. You will feel like your going no where in life, but interacting with different animals can be exciting. Until you have bad seeds."
PetSmart,1dijtn8dh52tb801,3.0,You are given the opportunity to learn a lot if you take it. However the stress of being a manager with them is not worth the what they pay. They also are going through a lot of changes at the moment and are starting to put employee's on the back end of the list
PetSmart,1dijajvelh46o802,5.0,Loved it there they were a very incredible company to work for. I had an awesome time meeting new people and being able to interact with all of the wonderful pets.
PetSmart,1diisr90p5j7h804,1.0,"They don't really care about the safety of the animals. most coworkers were fine, just the company didn't have the right safety precautions and they paid workers unfairly. also, management harassed employees and scheduled people unfairly (i.e. same levels employees some having 10 hours some 40 hours)."
PetSmart,1diihh3lf5j7h802,2.0,Only giving stars because I got to work with dogs. Management was awful. Was moved into a different department without consulting first or even letting me know just changed the schedule on me because manager didn’t like me.
PetSmart,1dih4icn5h3qs800,3.0,"The hours were very flexible with my school schedule but that's because they hardly ever let me work, I was constantly making less than $100 per week and have to constantly handle and provide customer service to people that spend more than my pay check every time they come to the register. My paycheck wasn't even worth two bags of dog food."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1di7446r15nba800,2.0,"My store leaders, focused on criticizing ridiculous things like keeping the tables disinfected 100% of the time, not holding the pet's restraint harnesses but the pets themselves, and maintaining impossible standards of sterilization. Rather than on important issues.  We were severely understaffed, and down a bathing area due to lack of water pressure.  Disappointing!!"
PetSmart,1di6og375h3mb801,3.0,"This was my first job & it helped me learn what a busy environment is like. The management was very bad. Coworkers were okay. Usually one person is at register, one at the fish section, and one doing stock so when it got busy it was horrendous. Pay is awful, hours are awful."
PetSmart,1di6btqtsbrfh800,4.0,"It’s a decent work place to get you by. Management is a good position to be in, but associatess don’t get many hours or pay. The customers are great to form a bond with and start conversations."
PetSmart,1di6bkpbkb8ap801,2.0,"Being a groomer is incredibly taxing work. No matter what you do, you're underpaid, under valued, and so far past stressed it's ridiculous. You spend busy days drowning in work, I didn't take lunches most days because I didn't have time. And even then I was leaving 1+ hours late every day. Management will not stand behind you for anything. If you upset a client and they want their money back, sucks to be you."
PetSmart,1di68jv22h3js803,1.0,The store manager at this location cares about himself only.
PetSmart,1di663lldb83b801,1.0,"they put WAY too many dogs into a play room, and leave you in there alone without help for 4 , sometimes 5 hours at a time. Like a lot of corporate companies, they''ll give you 'part-time' status, but ask you to work 32 hours per week, keeping you just under the amount needed for benefits"
PetSmart,1di3ieman5nba800,5.0,"I only left because my manager ruined it for me.  He made it a horrible working environment, but overall the company in general was wonderful and I would go back and work there now that he's no longer there."
PetSmart,1di36jkdvh3mb800,5.0,I only worked part time which is a 4hr work shift. The amount of hours overall depends on # of staff and hours required so you never know from week to week how many hours you will get. The hardest part of the job was keeping busy as a cashier on slow days. You can straighten the front row near the door but it can be quiet. The most enjoyable part is dealing with the customers especially those that brought in their pets!
PetSmart,1di31mtvth3js802,4.0,The managers are amazing and do their best everyday. I can definitely say that the hardest part of the job is the customers.  They show no mercy to any employee.
PetSmart,1di1pql55h3js800,3.0,"Good company to work for with great benefits and bonuses. Was originally suppose to be a temporary job until I found my main job, ten years later I'm the assistant store leader."
PetSmart,1dhviglucbrfh800,1.0,The co-workers suck. Its not worth the hard work and back pain. No one showed me a lot of things I kinda just had to figure it out for myself. No one told me about the break room until after more than a month of me being there. No one told me about how many breaks you can take or at what point you get a lunch. People take advantage of me having me do their dogs when I have dogs of my own. Theyve literally rescheduled mine so that I could do theirs
PetSmart,1dhv7jebih3qc805,1.0,"Management makes employees feel as if they are bothering them or getting on their nerves. Does not care much about their employees only cares about the money. Management gossips a lot which keeps a lot of things going on in the salon and causes drama. Very very Poor management, would not recommend working here. This particular petsmart has went through 13 employees within the last year."
PetSmart,1dhv0mg4dh469802,1.0,"The grooming salon was where I shined. For some reason I was demoted and placed at the register. I did so with a smile and professionalism. I was never taken seriously for opportunities to grow. I really wanted to become a groomer. Which you had to go to Jacksonville, NC to train. I never got the opportunity bc I gave my 2 weeks."
PetSmart,1dhut6unch469802,2.0,"I still have nightmares (no joke, literal nightmares) from my time at Petsmart. It made me quit grooming completely. The management is a joke at all of the petsmarts. Corporate doesn’t care AT ALL about their groomers. They push them to do as many dogs as they can (even if it’s not safe) and they make ridiculous rules for them to follow, when they know NOTHING about grooming."
PetSmart,1dhudq2n9b83b802,4.0,"I really enjoyed my time at PetSmart. I worked with an amazing team and it was the best place for me to start my employment history. I learned a lot of valuable skills working with other people and in customer service. The managers are more than fair and always willing to help you do your best every day. They understand that everyone is going to have a rough day at some point on the job and they help you get back into a working mindset on those bad days. The most difficult part of the job for me was waking up at 5 AM for the days I was assigned to bedding changes in the Pet Care department. My favorite part of the job was definitely working in the fish department considering I now have 11 aquariums. Fish are definitely a life long hobby of mine. Overall, it's a fantastic place to work and build lifelong people skills."
PetSmart,1dhtbacs5b8am802,4.0,PetSmart is a great place to work with many opportunities for advancement.  I have learned a lot about pets and their individual care.  There are also many locations so transfering to a different location is fairly easy.
PetSmart,1dhsckv3f5j6o800,3.0,It was a good place to work at. The pay was decent. Management wasn't all that but it was a great job to have while in school and paying minimum to no bills.
PetSmart,1dhro4qhth3ub800,1.0,"Terrible experience, doesnt care about the pets or the employees, doesn't care about promoting women or people who pursue high education. I tried to utilize HR about a very bad management situation and no one cared. I wish I hadn't wasted 3 years of my life working here."
PetSmart,1dhrkhe625nfr801,2.0,"At my location, people are in authority that shouldnt be. There is no real structure or foundation and things keep happening that shouldn't happen there. There is no real precautions for your actions. No one gets fired there, you almost have to kill some one!! They are too worried  about the turn over rate!!"
PetSmart,1dhrjkktjh42n800,3.0,"Managers at my location were amazing, the job was easy enough, and seeing animals everyday was a plus. The pay isn’t that great, but for a short term, part time job it’s alright."

PetSmart,1dhrf08d4brfh803,3.0,"When I first started out at Petsmart it was a fun and exciting environment. However, as I have progressed with this job, there have been situations that stuck out that to me. Whether its been my hours be cut drastically, communication problems, and managers not doing their jobs. It has made working there more of a struggle than any other job I've worked."
PetSmart,1dhrevq8dh3mb800,2.0,Production standards always going up now at 100% and must be maintained or it out the door....stupid attendance policy....annual increase is next to nothing for busting your *** all year...but I do have to say as far as the company its self they do treat the employees good
PetSmart,1dhnp0qssb879801,4.0,"Typical day can be chaotic, but consists of a lot of customer service. Helping customers and pet parents find their products and recommending products. As well as covering breaks and making sure inventory is kept as stocked as possible."
PetSmart,1dhnhr181b879802,1.0,"They tell you to clean as you go, but if you don't hit those numbers, you better just start leaving slots even more messy than you found them or else! If you are not 20-something and fit, forget it. In any case, apply only if you can stand taking 0 pride in your work, every day, all 10-12 hours."
PetSmart,1dhnd2vp8b879800,2.0,most days everyone is running around doing everything with little to no recolonization of all they do and it always seems like we are under staffed. I have learned a lot about different animals and their care as well are working with a team and acting like a manager without the title.
PetSmart,1dhn8gbmu52so801,2.0,"Upper management, district manager and above.  Completely out of touch with unrealistic expectations.  Payroll is not enough to get everything done.  Too much stress, and too many demands that effect your home life.  I was there for nearly 11 years.  I left because of management and the lack of support, and respect."
PetSmart,1dhn5lk7rh3ub802,2.0,"A typical day at work derives of taking care of all the animals, fish, reptiles, birds, crickets, worms, roaches, tarantula, making sure that every single one of them goes to the vet if needed, or if they should be isolated in the backroom or not. This is just a vague touch on what we actually do, ask someone who's actually done this job, there's a lot more to it."
PetSmart,1dhn3jkhuh3mb806,1.0,I went from being a dog trainer to a cashier because the trainer who trained me was a pompous jerk who didn’t know squat about people and how to treat them.
PetSmart,1dhmp2dre5nba802,3.0,I would come in unload pallets from merchandise truck from there i would stock products from pallets to sales floor and i would also assist with ringing when requested to do so.
PetSmart,1dhmf2iijb83b800,5.0,The Petsmart in Fontana provided excellent management. i really enjoyed working at Petsmart. My fellow employees were very great to work with. The work environment at Petsmart is very nice. I recommend getting a job at Petsmart. It's a great place to work.
PetSmart,1dhklpml5brev801,1.0,"The Petsmart in Lone Tree is absolute garbage to work at.  Definitely not worth your pay or benefits.  All the departments are constantly at war with each other.  All management are scheming or don't have the cahones to do their job right.  They over schedule their part timers also.  Especially the hotel.  It's like game of thrones in there. Like with all the toxicity in there are the dogs even being cared for?  They treat their employees so unfairly just to keep their ""image"" intact.  Really. Do not even try Lone Tree, Co.  Corporate even hates that store and everything in it."
PetSmart,1dhkkuhkq0kbr000,3.0,"I used to work in the salon a while back, and management was never any help. We would ask for items we needed and would never get them or would have to wait months too. One manager in particular cared more about other unimportant and immature things, then her actual job. Pay is low for the amount of work you do, and again management does not care about you.  Customers that"
PetSmart,1dhke44urh45m800,4.0,"Petsmart as a whole has wonderful values and their mission states they are there for the pets. With awesome opportunities to advance into management, fair pay, and great benefits for the full timers. I love this company and I'm sad to part with it."
PetSmart,1dhkbs5jph3tp800,3.0,PetSmart is a good place but there are drama with coworkers. The hours are inconsistent. You sometimes get good hours and sometimes you don’t. This place is good if you like animals but isn’t a career. Only temporary
PetSmart,1dhjvvhthh3pp800,1.0,"Never more than 5 hour shifts to part time workers, but make us come in more than needed instead of just a few 8 hour days. So much work to get done on top of helping customers and most of the time I was taking care of the entire pet care department AND helping customers with animals by myself."
PetSmart,1dhjuaj1kh45m802,4.0,Pet smart was a fun job. I started put as a stocker and that's all I did was stock shelves. Until they eventually moved me to the cash register and there I excelled.
PetSmart,1dhjoh6ih5j6f804,1.0,"It’s not a terrible place but you definitely put up with a lot of junk when you work here. Animals before people so God forbid something happens to a human, they will not care at all."
PetSmart,1dhjg6bloh3tp800,1.0,Not a great company in all a lot of shadyness..does not meet up with company standard falling firing someone after a complaint was mad they didnt care

PetSmart,1dhinf868h3j7800,2.0,"Working at Petsmart in Annapolis was not a great experience at all. Schedules were usually made friday for the week starting Sunday. Absolutely ridiculous. Managers often bent rules for themselves, going into the breakroom and having conversations with other employees who were actually on break. (Happened several times while on the clock)"
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1dh7i34hp5j67800,3.0,Is not enough but It is ok for me. I wish they give me more hours to work. Because it no enough hour for me. The pay emits fare but not enough hours for the pay
PetSmart,1dh78et4v0kbg000,4.0,"I love the company and the benefits. The schedule is very flexible however you could have 28 hours 1 week and 4 the next. Training isnt the best, they rely a lot on other associates which isnt a good method. The work they expect of you and your coworkers isnt always the same nor consistent. Management is great, it's a fun environment a lot of the time but in a high traffic store management can be stressed which usually gets taken out on employees. Customers are great, you really build a bond with them and their pets."
PetSmart,1dh77fjs4h3th800,4.0,THEY NEGOTIATE PAY***
PetSmart,1dh76l6ih0kbg000,1.0,Petsmart was one of the worst places I have ever worked for. Very unprofessional and all they care about are making sales quotas and not about the employees or pet parents.
PetSmart,1dh71i91hh3lg803,1.0,Management sucks in both stores i was at. The company sucks as a whole they dont care about employee's or the dogs honestly. They care about money  $$$
PetSmart,1dh703umgh3lg803,2.0,"Every store is different, and will depend on the managers at your location. I had serious issues with my store team, but there are plenty of stores that are awesome."
PetSmart,1dh6u2lj1b82g800,3.0,I have been to 5 different petsmart locations and its always management that needs the most improvement. I have seen many managers get away with harassing and bullying employees here within the company. Also the way that they trained me to be a groomer is ridiculous. They now have a more extensive training and pay for the new groomer tools.
PetSmart,1dh6plumgh45f803,3.0,A typical day at work with PetSmart would start at 4:00am with stocking all products so that the customers had a large variety to choose from within the store.
PetSmart,1dh5si0qch45f800,3.0,It was tough to work with a manager/co-manager that don't want you to advance because of the color of your skin. Never had I ever worked with 2 racist managers before.
PetSmart,1dh5j56k8h3j2801,5.0,"Fun, fast-paced job where you receive thorough hands-on training and gain lots of experience working with animals."
PetSmart,1dh5b0r37h420800,4.0,A typical day for a pet care associate would be;
PetSmart,1dh4lmvarh420801,3.0,"The store leader knows how to hire very nice, hardworking people.  The store culture is generally lighthearted and fun.  But the workload is high and the pay is low.  Additionally, associates are scheduled for short shifts (4-5 hours) while management can be scheduled for 7+ days in a row, long shifts (9 hours) and every single weekend. Scheduling leaves a lot to be desired."
PetSmart,1dh4jsq47h3j2802,4.0,I actually didn’t hate this job. If I would’ve gotten paid more per hour I definitely would have stayed. Working with all the animals was really fun. I enjoyed cleaning as well as feeding the animals. Customer service wasn’t my favorite part of the job though but that would be at any job.
PetSmart,1dh49jm36b8aa802,5.0,It is a treat to help customers find the best food and other necessities for their pets. We all love pets and therefore educating customers and ensuring they have what they need and more for their pets is truly satisfying.
PetSmart,1dh39nj8qb826803,2.0,"You don't advance by being competent and honest, you advance by brown-nosing your superiors. I watched multiple people who were completely unqualified and/or clueless get promoted beyond their abilities. Hard work is rewarded with a pittance raise, usually less than 50 cents, during your yearly review. PetSmart does not give raises based on cost of living and will start you at minimum. If you work there several years, and minimum wage gets raised in your state, congrats, you make minimum wage again. New hires will then make more than you before long. Animal care is secondary to money. Sell sell sell."
PetSmart,1dh33mv7ib8a8800,1.0,"Management fires you if you question their animal care. I own many animals and am studying to be a vet, once I started working here I noticed that the reptile tanks were always dirty, the birds hardly ever had food and the small mamals had injuries. I tried cleaning the tanks but I was told not to worry about something that isnt my job and to just stay at the register. By the end of the month I was fired for ""refusing"" to clean the store. A few months later the manager was fired too."
PetSmart,1dh2q7lk45j63800,2.0,"Working at PetSmart was awful and they made you feel awful. You were encouraged to work off the clock to show your support.  In the grooming salon, you were instructed to work in the front of the store even you commissioned out (this means that you passed what your base pay for 40hrs for the week would be- free work for them.) You are not supposed to work in the front if you commissioned out, but were threatened to be fired if you didn't. The salon is in the back of the store, which means when you take lunch you have a very limited time to do so as you were also timed with the pets that you're grooming. You had to go to the front of the store to clock out but were often asked to help people in the store while off the clock. In which you were never compensated back. Several of the groomers had worked multiple times a week off the clock. When HR was called due to harassment, HR called the store manager and repeated the entire conversation with others in the room and all personal information given. Which drove for more harassment. My advice is to stay away from PetSmart or always get a paper trail. Take pictures of your time clock and record conversations."
PetSmart,1dh2hqqv7h41q801,3.0,"When I first got this job, I absolutely loved it. My managers were phenomenal and there was a lot of promise of myself moving up in the company. However, we had new management come in, which completely changed the moral of all the workers in the store. I have almost walked out of the job on multiple occasions due to demeaning behavior by the highest paid managers in the store and I plan to put in my 2 weeks the moment I have another position lined up. Its amazing how much of a difference good and bad managers make in a small store such as petsmart."
PetSmart,1dh20jtee52v0802,1.0,Honestly there was one manager that tried to make everyone's lives miserable but that was nothing compared to watching animals being neglected (and managers refusing to do much about it until the animal died). They're heartless and cruel. Regret every applying.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1dh20d9lsh3tb800,3.0,At my location we went through 12 store managers they always have their own agenda. The company continued to change their mission statement and the new owners are all for profit
PetSmart,1dh1vibqob89j800,4.0,"I helped clean and care for the cats. I volunteered for the cat shelter for the summer and found it to be very relaxed, yet challenging. I learned how to manage my time and how to properly care for the cats."
PetSmart,1dh0jr4l0h3hq800,4.0,"Timed orders, physically demanding, very fast pace, and sometimes critical environment. Be sure to take notes on any and all rules/proceedures because there is no handbook later on. If you have any questions, ask an LP associate or member of DC services because some managers aren't as well informed and can frequently miscommunicate with associates & management on other shifts."
PetSmart,1dh0dbooib863800,3.0,"Hours are sparse and inconsistent, you will get an closing one day and an opening the next. The people who work there are nice but the work environment can be retaliatory."
PetSmart,1dh093le15n9r800,3.0,Busy day in and day out. Expected to always attend to customers and ask more than once if they found what they need or need assistance. Always asked to up-sell.
PetSmart,1dh01pded5j63800,3.0,No raises. Cannot talk about your wage or you'll be fired. Management is relaxed and recently I had trouble with some manager. Everybody that works there are super nice and understandable.
PetSmart,1dgvv3a8o5j63800,2.0,HR is not very helpful even when you have reoccurring issues. Definitely not a life long career. Otherwise it wasn't too bad. They definitely expect way too much out of you.
PetSmart,1dgvkh2brbrdq800,5.0,"I personally never applied to the store I work for. I was a volunteer for the cat adoptions, and was asked to apply with how often I was there for the cats. I have been there for a quite a while and I really have no complaints. We don't pretend we know stuff. Even in the training videos, it says ""its okay to say you don't know."" don't lie to the pet parents. If you don't know, say so, you can always ask a manager or another associate. It did take some time to get used to saying ""Pet Parents"" and ""Can I ASSIST you"" but I like my job. When you own a lot of random pets like I do, it comes in handy to work at a pet store."
PetSmart,1dgt6mit952tu800,3.0,"I was a part-time pet care associate. I was usually scheduled for two days a week. Which ended up being 10-13 hours a week. Pay was weekly. My store did not have A/C at all, and the store leader did nothing about it. It was over a hundred degrees outside. Pet care always ended up with so many customers. And there was only one pet care associate per shift. It was overwhelming."
PetSmart,1dgsoaq4u5n90800,4.0,"Coworkers were usually very friendly and helpful to everyone.  They were understanding about urgent things coming up and being unable to come into work.  If someone was struggling with a particular pet or customer, other coworkers would step in to help."
PetSmart,1dgr4blgch44v800,5.0,PetSmart is a really exciting place to work. You never know what animal is going to walk through the door. I worked at the cash register and would help with stocking/changing stickers.
PetSmart,1dgr025m6h44v800,3.0,"Generally I've had a good time working for PetSmart, but I've worked at two very poor salons and stores where the management couldn't care less about their employees. If the groomers had an issue with something going on in the salon that needed to be fixed, the managers would simply say ""there's the door"". Not to mention the amount of added work that corporate keeps adding to a groomers already stressful and busy day, the managers will come in and tell us there is a call parked on a line but won't stop to simply answer the phone call when they're not busy on the floor. The managers are trained to be able to help the salon when we're busy to help keep generating more business but they simply don't do that. Definitely think twice before working for PetSmart, especially on the floor, and ask around the employees of their experience of working at that current store and tell them to be real with you. It's not the worth the stress or mental anguish."
PetSmart,1dgqq56febrdg801,5.0,"It's a fulfilling job to work with the animals and help people understand the care of them more, but the customer service aspect is what kills it. Still a good experience overall though"
PetSmart,1dgqmg9eeh44v800,1.0,"Management is useless and the salon is run by a bunch of  children. Most groomers mishandle and mistreat the dogs. It is very crowded which doesnt help prevent conflicts between the dogs. I saw many dogs mishandled and sometimes teased/baited because it's ""funny"", along with many accidents resulting in the need for vet care. Negligence!!!"
PetSmart,1dgq0kl3u52tu800,3.0,"I loved working as a groomer until the management changed. Favoritism seems to be a big part of the store. If you are well liked you can get away with anything. Going above and beyond gets you nowhere.  Grooming coupons are taken out of your pay. The salon environment is extremely stressful to not only the groomers but the animals as well. If you can ignore all the negatives about the job,  pay is decent and benifits are good."
PetSmart,1dgogb1hch3l0800,5.0,"I used to work here taking care of the animal habitats, I would always come back home extremely tired from all the hard work I had to do because it's a very physical demanding job but I never complained once of being stressed out or being treated poorly by customers. It's a very fun job to have, in all honesty I wish I could of stayed but getting $ .05 and only working less than 20 hrs a weeks wasn't enough for me."
PetSmart,1dgnpm1emh3p4800,5.0,I would work there again if I had the opportunity. I worked at the same store for almost 11 years. Of course like any job it has it’s ups and downs but overall the job was good and benefits were great!
PetSmart,1dgneubqhh44v800,3.0,"Not really sure what else to say here, I loved this job but the management was an issue along with those I worked with. I was let go 2 days after I was injured and my bills weren't covered and actually still aren't 3 years later. Depending on your store and location I would look into the store in depth before working there."
PetSmart,1dgkucchdh44v800,4.0,"Opportunity to advance is excellent, good work environment depending on management.  As a company, senior store management is great, I just happen to have one that js the exception to the rule. PetSmart is very associate oriented, working to ensure that all associates are taken care of and the work environment is enjoyable and rewarding. I would highly recommend them and certainly say as a career opportunity, definitely a great place to work!!!"
PetSmart,1dgjp3vfph3p4800,4.0,You needed to have a passion for grooming and patience to boot for this job. I didn't get paid enough for the volume of work they expected of me and I've heard they made it worse since then.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1dgivfgnhh41g800,4.0,Petsmart is pretty good. Only downfall was lack of communication with the salon manager. Other than this it's a decent pace to start if you're looking on working with animals as a future career path.
PetSmart,1dghj5b2e5j5a800,3.0,"Grooming at PetSmart is just numbers. Almost everyday there I couldn’t even take my 30 minute lunch due to poor management and over booking dogs. There are days I would come home and couldn’t even walk from the car to the front door with out feeling like my feet were numb. Not to mention they allow two 15 min breaks but you couldn’t even take those either. There was never any room for moving up unless you became salon manager and even then your groomers would make more than you. After 4 years, my body and mind says I’m done."
PetSmart,1dghdtnda5j5a800,4.0,"I love my coworkers and I do love Petsmart, they offer flexible hours and have transferred my job when I even moved states! I'm a bather and the hardest part of the job is the stress. Dealing with sometimes horrible owners who just want free things or scared dogs that really test your patience. It can be hard to balance with life mostly because I always come out of work exhausted and wet/dirty. The tipping at my store is great so I do get paid very well and it's a rewarding job at the end of the day to work with animals we all have a STRONG compassion for them to work this job!"
PetSmart,1dgh7geot52tu800,3.0,"I left petsmart because of the career I am studying opened a door for me. Also, the particular petsmart I left got to the point they'd sell an animal to anyone to make money regardless how it was treated, and to keep customer complaints as low as possible."
PetSmart,1dgh7gelkb899805,4.0,I worked in the PetsHotel for 2 summers. I've worked with animals in the past so I knew going in that it would be a hard job. It is best to know going in that this job is exhausting both physically and mentally because people love to drop off their problem dogs to have us deal with instead.
PetSmart,1dgh56ir7b88n800,4.0,"Retail is retail. Some managers are strict, some are more lax. Some coworkers are back-stabbing jerks, others pretty chill and open with how they feel."
PetSmart,1dgh2ltse24fe000,5.0,Petsmart was overall an amazing experience! Staff was friendly and management was encouraging and supportive. Career advancement available and they take good care of the animals!
PetSmart,1dgg9bcga24fu000,4.0,"I enjoyed my job quite a bit, but I am trying to start a business in dog care and didn't want to violate a non compete, so I left to start my own company, and am looking for a part time job to help me supplement my income while starting up."
PetSmart,1dgg46p4324fe000,2.0,"I worked at PetSmart for about five months. I was a Pet Care Associate, also trained as a cashier, so I spent the majority of my time working with animals or customers looking for items related to their small animals, reptiles, and birds. As someone who has extensive knowledge on small animals such as rabbits, guinea pigs, and of birds, I was really disappointed by the lack of knowledge the rest of my coworkers had regarding them. Birds don't and can't live off just seeds, and they need relatively big cages, not those tiny cages PetSmart sells. They also need outside time from their cages. Same with rabbits and guinea pigs. Many of our customers were uninformed about reptiles and their lighting requirements, and my coworkers did OK explaining, but didn't cover all bases. Coworkers were mostly nice though. Mostly our customers were awful about our fish. You can't put a plecostomus in a 5 gallon tank, nor can you just release them into the lake near your house once they get too big for you. They'll die, or mess up the ecosystem as they are an invasive species to my state. PetSmart has a policy where you can say no to a sale of an animal, but management wouldn't let you do that for fish. Now, moving away from the ignorance of coworkers and customers in regards to animals, I'd like to talk about the ignorance to mental illness and health that management has. I'm someone struggling with my health, and always have. I was put on lithium in June, and I had become progressively more sick. By the end of my taking the medication, I was throwing up daily and I was shaking violently shortly"
PetSmart,1dgft2rheh40j800,3.0,"At the time I was at Petsmart I honestly didn’t like it . The pay was poor, and the management wasn’t up to par . We always had very little time to finish a nice amount of stuff ."
PetSmart,1dgfjsgfdh40j800,5.0,"It was my first job while I was in high school. I learned how to clean their cages, feed them, give them water, and sometimes let the cats out so they can get their exercise."
PetSmart,1dgea7q53h40j800,1.0,"Cliche's, informal hierachy, and managers that no little to nothing at all about running a brick-and-morter, absolute failure of a business unit. Horrible!!!!"
PetSmart,1dgdufn6u24fu000,5.0,"The company itself is pretty good to work for. Basic customer service, retail. Making sure the shelves are full and customers are assisted are the biggest goals of early morning stock team."
PetSmart,1dgdrb4h05ncu800,1.0,"Manager can't keep people because the working conditions are poor. Constant turnover.  No incentive to do any better.  You're slapped into a job with very little training.  Specific positions are required to do corporate training - employees are told to stop doing the training in order to help in other areas (eg stocking shelves, ringing at register).  Poor pay, manager trying to make numbers to benefit his/herself.  Assistant store manager very bad at job - numerous times found locked in office sleeping at desk (the main office had a glass pane in the door).   Asst. manager showed favoritism, picked on employees that he/she thought they could bully, would be missing (would go outside of building) wouldn't answer pages or calls.  Numerous complaints to corporate HR from a wide range of employees resulted in no improvement.  Store manager and Asst. Store manager would make promises to employees that would never materialize.  Told you are hired to do a specific job and once you are hired you are doing something else.  The only thing that made this job enjoyable are a few decent employees."
PetSmart,1dgdma4t224gu000,4.0,"The animals will be loud the customers will give attitude, but over all the people that work there are so nice and it's a warm environment. you learn how the bath dogs, cut their nail, ways to hold them, and how to book appointments with the pet parent"
PetSmart,1dgdgo0mp24fu000,5.0,I did orderfill mod ect for years. Very nice comp they take care of there employees and give them things and goals to not only better the warehouse but as a person also
PetSmart,1dgdal4u3b84r800,4.0,I loved working at petssmart but sadly no advancements and also I couldn't afford to stay because I couldn't live off only part time salary.
PetSmart,1dgbs07thbrcm800,1.0,This place is ran like a Chinese sweat shop you take back to back calls all day the call flow is unrealistic for pet parents that have already been with us they don’t care about there employees at all they expect you to take calls all day and not get overwhelmed or burnt out and when you do it’s a sign of weakness they ask for feed back but don’t actually use it to better the center the hr is a snake the hiring manager is crazy and when you ask questions she don’t like she’ll take you in her office and intimidate you and tell you if you don’t do it her way you’ll loose your job over all this is the worst place to work
PetSmart,1dgbe85qnb84k800,1.0,This is a terrible place to work with the worst upper management  imaginable! The Corporate office is an absolute disaster they never back their managers and only take the side of the lying little kids who don’t want to work and play the stab you in the back corporate CARE line game. I was treated with total disrespect from the District manager and complete Narcissistic Store Leaders.
PetSmart,1dgb2v4t324et000,4.0,"A typical day would start at 9:30 when I come in and the closing manager would let me know how many dogs and cats there were and what wasn't done yet. And that was where I had to start off. I would clean empty kennels, do the laundry, clean buckets and refill them for the morning shift. At about 2 am I would start getting the food ready for all the dogs and cats that were there and at 4 am I would feed all the animals then at 4:30 I would start walking the dogs one by one till I finished walking all of the dogs or until the morning crew came in if I couldn't finish walking all the dogs. This job taught me to manage my time very well and taught me to get a lot done in a matter of a few hours."

PetSmart,1dgad88eb24gr000,1.0,was uninviting and a bad place for different ideas the culture was still and a place for people to just stay and rot. was the worst place I have ever worked
PetSmart,1dg8q169o5ncl800,5.0,Great company to work for. Lots of room and opportunity for advancement. Very organised and well managed. Very progressive and promote mostly from within.
PetSmart,1dg8l0uflb88j800,4.0,It's a fun place to work but can be slow and stressful at times. Get a long with your salon crew and you will be able to get through some sticky situations that may pop in.
PetSmart,1dg8d1sjd24gd000,2.0,"Just when it comes to your one-year evaluation, raise, and benefit qualifications, they tell you that because they required you to start part-time for 6 months, you had to be put in as seasonal. Time spent working as seasonal does not count towards your company time to qualify for a raise or benefits. Also, tuition reimbursement is only for advancing up the PetSmart ladder, which from what I have seen, does nothing because they prefer to higher from outside the company rather than within."
PetSmart,1dg8ao1r6b88j800,3.0,I think that Petsmart was great experience. During my time at Petsmart I learned a great deal of time management and how to work well under stressful conditions.
PetSmart,1dg80n8fp24gd000,5.0,I was pregnant and high risk so needed something for the time being. They worked with my schedule well and when I was sick they understood and help me get through it!

PetSmart,1dg7a85lc52sp800,3.0,"There were some decent human beings at my store, co-workers and managers alike."
PetSmart,1dg73r3vvb88j800,3.0,"Because it’s a big corporation there are book and manuals all over to tell you what to do, how to do it and on what days. It’s a very structured work place, but every day will be different. You have to find a way to help and greet customers whenever you see them and get all of the daily tasks done. I was first trained how to work the register for about two hours , then had to man the register by my self for the remaining two hours of my shift. The next shift I came in for I met the other pet care staff working that day before they left and was briefly given an overview of how the shift would go and then was expected to close for the night untrained in petcare. Luckily I had the manuals to tell me what to do in some aituations but others were harder and fell outside of what the manual said to do. When I came in for my next shift I was told all I had done wrong by the pet care manager which sucked but I explained I had no real training and she understood."
PetSmart,1dg6dsn28brcm800,5.0,"I would always come in on time and go right to work at the cash register. I would clean my area, and make it look good for customers coming in the door. I greeted customers as they would come in the door."

PetSmart,1dg635g7d24gd000,3.0,"I loved this job at first, but as I continued to work there, Corporate added more and more rules to follow that made the atmosphere less fun and taking care of the animals more difficult."
PetSmart,1dg5t90mbb80v800,1.0,"Crazy call flow, supervisors are always pulled to do other things all the time, hardly there to helping their teams,  Leads are Left to help everyone and over worked, and not paid for all they do, Managers are a joke and the blonde is a snake, the older lady can be very rude, very Unrealistic goals to meet, best employee all quit due to being stressed out or got fired and the ones still there don’t wanna be there,, QA is a mess,"
PetSmart,1dg5q2emsb88j800,3.0,The best part of this job is your coworkers and the animals!! It’s pretty much your average retail job with more responsibilities and very face paced.
PetSmart,1dg5l2ocnb88j800,4.0,"I worked for this company for 4 years. Within my time at Petsmart I learned to be a dog groomer at there academy. I highly recommend working for this company if you're interested in working with animals and would like to work in a ever growing clientele based job. It is fast paced, and they offer opportunities to advance in the company."
PetSmart,1dg5hi2vn24ef002,5.0,"As far as retail goes it’s probably the best out there. If you’re willing to make the sacrifices, work hard, and are willing to move around/relocate you can make it far within the company."

PetSmart,1dfurt1r61d0l000,2.0,"I started as a bather in the grooming salon, after the basic computer tests you'll start right away with hands on training which quickly becomes very stressful, as nail trims and dog baths are in high demand.. you will however get good weekly hours depending on the season and the store ofc. The salon environment will differ from store to store, so I can only speak on my own experiences.. but the salon has always somewhat been hostile, and a very cliquey work environment. The salon I worked in was very small, and crowded, so it was easy for people to get frustrated and start unprofessional drama in the work place. I would recommend if you're interested in the job to stay focused on the care of the animal no matter how stressful the work environment gets, they are what matters most. This is not the job for the lazy or the weak, it will try your patience and make you want to cry at times, but always remember to only sign up to work with animals if you're fully prepared to take on all the stress and fast decision making that comes with it."
PetSmart,1dfupa31024g4000,5.0,"Have worked there 7 years. Love the job. Great management team.  Would like to see better pay,  feel like they do need a better training  program as far as new trainers"
PetSmart,1dfuctv441d0e000,3.0,"It was a great starter job when I worked there. Toward the end, the store I was at started to fall apart in terms of management. They wanted you to know more roles then what your job title was for the same amount of pay. I only made minimum wage. Raises were not even a dollar."
PetSmart,1dfucbftq24gk000,1.0,My experience was not a god one working for petsmart. The managers are very terrible to their employees and do not help what so every at the store i worked at. loved the animals and the customers but the managers drive everyone who cares away. would not recommend working here unless its an absolute must.
PetSmart,1dftt1rrj24ek000,3.0,The environment is pretty relaxed but they don't give you many hours and the benefits are below average compared to the costs. employees get 15% off and free nail grinding in the salon.
PetSmart,1dftockfl24g4000,4.0,The job was okay. I really liked the people I worked with but it's retail so anyone who can avoid it is going to. They pay was minimum wage but that's to be expected for an entry level retail position.
PetSmart,1dftme5tq24gk000,2.0,Have to send half our dogs home because now if there is even a slight chance a dog may get nicked due to matting or behavior the groomers are vilified. Lunches are treated like chores to get out of the way if it is at all inconvenient for management. Company offers discounts that hit groomers commision.
PetSmart,1dfsi4ie624fk000,4.0,"I enjoy my co-workers and managers, the pay and hours are not too great though."
PetSmart,1dfsgnos11fdi000,3.0,As a bather at Petsmart I hated it. Salon manager was not fit for a leadership position and told me that her and some  of the other groomers would be mean to new employees on purpose so that they would quit. I know that the grooming environment can be stressful but a few people in there were hostile and inappropriate.
PetSmart,1dfsbro4j24g1000,4.0,"In the pet care department every day is different. You can expect a pattern when it comes to what you clean, because that doesn't change. Company is super focused on customer engagement so if that isn't for you, don't apply.  That being said, working with the animals and learning about them was fun. people come in for ridiculous things though about items we don't carry in the store (That is something corporate decides so the best you can do is tell them to leave a review, like every customer service job ever)."
PetSmart,1dfs884pk1d01000,3.0,"There is a lack of home and work balance and the store management at the time was terrible. The corp, doesn't seem to care about their employees only the Money they make off of them. Its great if you have enough passion to put-up with that"
PetSmart,1dfrt75k21d01000,5.0,Working at petsmart was fun. Got to be around dogs. Co-workers were also great people. Best part is when you got to see a dog get adopted and find a new home.

The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1dfq4e7p80kbh000,4.0,The team at my store is mostly good with a few exceptions. Some clearly don't care about the animals in our care and are only there for the paycheck. Corporate has made some very bad decisions and budget cuts that make work a lot more stressful. The animals are often not cared for correctly and employees aren't trained on the proper information to care for the animals we sell. Customers are given false information because we are told to guess what we don't know. It is up to the employees to do research.
PetSmart,1dfpu1knv24f1000,3.0,"Managers are more focused on selling products to customers and bombarding them with questions as soon as they get past the door. Many times if an animal is very sick and needs special attention management says no and pulls you to do other tasks without a second consideration for the pets life.  Cashiers are tasked with the job of 3 people, pet care can hardly ever fully get their daily tasks done due to management pulling them away to do other peoples jobs. Salon is over booked constantly and stressful to begin with without being rushed to get 5-6 dogs done in an 8 hour shift when each dog is booked a 2-3 hour slot."
PetSmart,1dfp4m1s81fdi000,5.0,Staff was very friendly! Truly a family! I loved my managers. They were super friendly and understanding. They truly cared about my wellbeing and getting to work! My car broke down and my managers left work to come get me! I am grateful for my 0150 Family!
PetSmart,1dfoevj0g1fdi000,2.0,"The biggest problem working here is the coworkers, like all petshops it attracts eccentric people, so your experience will vary depending on how much of that you can handle"
PetSmart,1dfo2aiqv24eh000,4.0,"This job is very stressful, but in this company under the right leadership it is very easy to grow and move up to new positions. I have been with PM for 7 years and moved up 3 positions. I have to be very flexible with hours I work, but its worth it."

PetSmart,1dfm9r85b0mch000,1.0,"Worked here for 3 years. Sold alot of product for the company (selling big tanks). Was promised I would get a raise every 6 mo and got two .10 raises in 3 years. Management is horrible. Will treat employees unfairly/ discriminate against workers. If u have an issue, good luck. Employees do not respect each other."
PetSmart,1dfm0jgqk24g1000,5.0,Before hiring a salon manager make sure they’re qualified and trained in that environment. For them to arbitrarily change work hours on part time employees availability without asking is ridiculous which drove me to leave
PetSmart,1dfkq3o8924e1000,3.0,"I do not prefer to be negative but ,It was a great learning experience for me in the animal world.A few nice co workers .I liked the idea of getting a pay check every week."
PetSmart,1dfknjdec0mt1000,3.0,I was right out of college and looking for a job when one of my friends told me to apply there. At the time management was poor but I do know that as of today it has improved greatly.
PetSmart,1dfjl9usg1d01000,3.0,"Petsmart is a wonderful company to begin a career with. They sent me to their own grooming school where I was trained with a variety of different breeds and gained a very strong comprehension of the career as well as supplied me with all the tools I needed to begin my career. I also gained a number of other skills from this job including the ability to ""up sale"" add on packages, operate an online booking system, learn to manage my time well so I could get pets in and out in an timely manner, as well as a great deal of patients in handling difficult pets and clients. It is a very fast paced work environment with a great deal of advancement opportunity. However the pay is very low compared to what you can make as a groomer, but it's a great place to begin to get a very strong knowledge of the career."
PetSmart,1dfhs69vo24fh001,4.0,"My Manager was terrible.  She didn’t try to get along with me and hurt my feelings.  I could have been a much better Manager than she was.  If she left me alone, i did my best work.  I knew what needed to be done but I don’t think she did."
PetSmart,1dfhhkrte24gh000,4.0,Working in the grooming section is hard work but rewarding. You learn how to change your schedule throughout the day. Due to online booking your day changes on a consistent basis.
PetSmart,1dfha00e91d01000,3.0,My supervisor micro managed me to death..Hated it...My commission also went down after becoming a privately owned co.. Then they were making changes to their work environment also. LIKE A BOILER ROOM TYPE ATMOSPHERE
PetSmart,1dfh73a9j1d11000,5.0,I was in Charge of answering phones answering questions of clients checking in and out dogs doing a full body review making sure that they were not matted and explaining on what kind of haircut the dog should take also bathing nail grinding teeth cleaning ear cleaning
PetSmart,1dfg32g4k24eh000,3.0,"The store I worked at had managers who sat around a lot and did meaningless tasks to keep from the real work. I was there for almost 3 years and never was evaluated or signed a raise. I received minimum each year. 18-20 cents. I was P/T and only hope of more was to go into mngt. All managers were real young and had no drive to improve store. DM came in rarely and never spoke to anyone but manager in office. Store manager was off every Saturday and the store was always understaffed on Saturday. Customers  looking for help but never enough there. I was an AM stocker. I came in at 5AM and out by 10. I never missed a day in a  store where people including managers called out frequently. I asked for money equaling other companies and was told, ""Your overpaid now"". I was the only employee in the store that had never called out. When I asked about doing something to improve sales, managers usually just walked away. I believe they equated more sales with more work."
PetSmart,1dffcsear1d0h000,5.0,"I would always come in and every employee and employer would greet me happily. They would always say ""Thank you!"" whenever you did anything. Everyone was always very helpful and was there if you needed anything. We all shared the same love for animals so we would discuss a lot about it"
PetSmart,1dffbar6024fh000,2.0,"Typical corporate job, overworked and underpaid staff that are given none of the resources necessary to carry out their very high expectations. Customer base is more important than the sanity and safety of staff and animals in the store."

PetSmart,1dfd7cjueh3m6800,5.0,"Working at PetSmart is not a job, it’s a community of those who work together for the love of pets. As an Early Morning Stocker, you will ensure the store is set up for a successful day. By keeping the shelves stocked with the best solutions and ensuring that it is merchandised correctly, you’ll help pet parents find the very best solutions for their pets every time they shop!"
PetSmart,1dfcmg7slbrdr801,4.0,"I loved the work, but being understaffed and constantly feeling the need to rush to meet quotas was incredibly stressful. Management also didn’t communicate within itself, so I would get in trouble for doing something one manager told me to do and of course they wouldn’t own up to it to save their own skin. I liked my general co-workers and the job however, so another location could be completely different."

PetSmart,1dfbo0ggth461800,2.0,All they care about is selling. My last straw was when they sold a bearded dragon to someone who obviously wasn’t fit. She didn’t know about it or have any of the supplies and wasn’t going to buy any. She was going to go home and order (which would take at least 2-3 days if not more). My manager sold it to her anyways. She brought it back dead 2 hours later after leaving it in her car because she “thought it would like the heat” and my manager then gave her a full refund
PetSmart,1dfac8s6hh423800,2.0,I loved my job and the people I worked with. The hardest part of any given day was dealing with ignorant customers that thought they could do my job better than me.
PetSmart,1df9pb8tu5nfj800,3.0,"Petsmart is great if you like animals and caring for them. hours are always available and flexible. retail is always tough so this isn't any better than working in a clothing store, customers are just as stressful to deal with."

PetSmart,1df95p17oh461800,4.0,"As someone who cares about animals, I feel like taking on a job at PetSmart is a big chance to learn more about pets, how to properly take care of them, and educate others on how to do so. My managers were always respectful, It requires a stomach, diligence, and patience - but it pays off."
PetSmart,1df93uep55nfj800,4.0,Some of my lower scores were because of difficult customers. It didn’t have anything to do with the people working there. It is also a corporation so it is always difficult to be a regular employee merely because your opinions are not heard higher up.

PetSmart,1df90912eh3qe800,4.0,"Funnest job I have yet to do, I get to take care of the animals and overall this job is a great start to any specialization in the animal field. It also teaches you social skills and more about animals"
PetSmart,1df7dmug6b85h800,2.0,Unfortunately I just had to deal with poor management. Other than that the only real issue here is rude customers and dealing with dogs passing away..
PetSmart,1df7cqi3v52v6800,1.0,"my managers sucked! Only ever one cashier in the evening, I had requested one day off and it was denied. It was my cousins graduation and I called off with 7 hours in advance and the manager gave me a hard time! Not my fault you only ever have 3 employees in the whole store at a time! And then my STORE managers husband would come in EVERYDAY and walk the store and give me nasty looks, then the manager would lock his dog in the office all day and only take it out 3 times a day. Then, I was only scheduled ONE DAY the whole month. Totally awful."

Part time associates get no paid vacation or time off. Management was always crying about lack of loyalty, but never did anything to gain any loyalty. They want to employ all part time associates so they don’t have to pay Benefits. Not a good place to work for any length of time."
PetSmart,1df6hrph8h3tl802,2.0,"I worked for petsmart years ago. Management was horrible. If you were not a part of mgmt cliques, then expect to be pulled of register to go clean feces in an aisle. Management became very verbally abusive mentally. If they did not like how something was cleaned, if I was in the bathroom, one manager in training, who was former managers best friend as well. Would Knock on the bathroom door and let me know to clean things through the door, Then when I started having attitudes with them, not tolerating the disrespect, they acted as if I was the problem from the start. I would then be told I would be able to train as a dog trainer, but then after months of waiting and asking come to find out it was the ""dangle the carrot over the horse's head"" treatment. And they gave the position to someone who knew nothing of dogs or dog care, that person was working with the small animals section. Do not waste your money on petsmart training."

PetSmart,1df5jdst65j5m800,2.0,"In the beginning, working at petsmart was great, but it soon changed. I applied to be a PetCare associate and a week or 2 later i was hired after going to THREE different interviews. When i got hired, i was told i would be trained to be in Petcare (keep in mind a petcare associate and a cashier are two different things). During the first 2 weeks, i was mainly on the computer watching petcare videos, then they had me on the register and said it was part of ""training"". It's been 4 months and i've still been on the register as a cashier. The management never continued to train me for the position i was hired for. I was even interviewed by the person incharge of petcare. During the three interviews it was made clear that i was hired to work with the animals and be on the floor, instead i was stuck as a cashier and the management didn't bother to notice. They also cut my hours soo short at one point, to the point where i was struggling to keep up with bills. It also kinda sucked that there were no benefits in being bilangual. Overall working at petsmart is very hit or miss. The management is not the best and You can't live off this job because of little pay & lack of hours."
PetSmart,1df5dfpj4h3hs800,1.0,The store manager is something else.. I've been a pretty loyal employee for roughly two years he talks down to me and treats me awful  sometimes I dont even want to go to work when he is there. He has denied me a higher paying position twice. First time he gave it to a new girl knowing full well I was interested and didn't even consider interviewing me. The second chance rolls around this time I get interviewed but it didn't matter since he told the employee he was interviewing he got the job without even giving me a chance. I'm currently looking for a new job because I am way underappreciated at this one.
PetSmart,1df5aga4lh45q800,1.0,"I have never worked anywhere as hostile as a PetSmart. In grooming you had close to no time for breaks and if you didn't take one you manager would write one in for you. If there was a problem you could never speak with managers in fear of being pulled from your work environment to be talked to ""privately"" by two to three managers at a time. The only way you can get through is by calling help lines, and even then, corporate received these calls and does nothing to care for or help its employees. After these events most all who have tried are bullied into quitting or just get their hours cut until they have none. PetSmart will almost never tell you directly you're getting fired or being let go. It's happened to a lot of co-workers I used to have."
PetSmart,1df54te3ih3q9800,4.0,Very fun workplace. You learn something new everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing all the fur babies and interacting with the loving pet parents!
PetSmart,1df4q0fqdh3m0800,5.0,Sometimes I get mad at my managers or coworkers but in the end it is a great company to work for. Management is friendly and pay is good. Working in the salon is stressful but you have the opportunity to earn tips for the dogs that you groom or bathe.
PetSmart,1df4iu6d3h3m0800,2.0,The manager would cut my hours every time I needed to take a day off. I would go from 30 to 15 hours a week for no reason every other week. Never had a stable work flow.

PetSmart,1df23sjmnh45q800,3.0,"My boss in particular was very flexible and worked with me to find a good schedule. I enjoyed working with all of the groomers in the salon, but tensions did get high sometimes. The hardest part is to stop what you doing while grooming a dog when checking the clients in and out, also having to answer the phone. It can be stressful when it’s busy on weekends and holidays. I enjoyed making clients and their dogs happy! It is a great place to work if you like to work with animals."

PetSmart,1descm50jh45q800,2.0,Well I worked for PetSmart in Hagerstown Md for almost10 years. I never had a break because no one would give me one. When I would get there early in the morning management would be out back smoking so no one would hear me ring the buzzer which made me late clocking in. I had so many chores to do early in the morning. I even asked if second shift could help out with the cleaning of the small animal cages bird cages and reptiles and I was told they had other things to do so I was stuck with it all. Management did not like me and I was treated like I always did some thing wrong. I hated my job because of the way they would treat me so I left after almost 10 years. Would I recommend people I know to work there probably not.

PetSmart,1deq5a2g0h41p800,3.0,"As a groomer, you mainly work on commission. However, the rules and regulations are extremely restriciting and unrealistic just to cover the company within the media. Groomers are under appreciated and usually work more than what they are scheduled (taking an actual break is rare). The company pushes for numbers as if you're a machine and does not care about your humanity. Only giving three stars for safety, being able to put up a good front, and the money is decent."

PetSmart,1depgp2bt5j5h801,1.0,when i first started to work for pet smart it was a great place to work.  they cared about their employees and animals in their care.  after they sold it was only about money.  we were told if the vet bill exceeded the animals value (most were only ($9.99-$15.99) we had to have them euthanized.  they kept cutting hours and putting more and more work on the managers.  i would not recommend working for this company as it stands today.

PetSmart,1denj2o12h44u800,1.0,"Store manager routinely does things to demotivate staff.  Treats them like children, although children might fair better.  Talks down to staff, rants and raves, acts like every time something breaks down money is coming out of manager's pocket to fix.  Ran out of printer paper twice just in the last month in the entire store.  Really?  Maybe manager buys paper at Staples 1-2 reams at a time so manager can claim mileage on car??? Not sure what motivates this type of thought process.  Very bad.  Calls out bad behavior of individual employees in front of other employees.  Very unprofessional from a management stand point."
PetSmart,1dengj0k9b83o800,3.0,"I worked as a bather in the salon for about 9 months. It is extremely stressful as you're expected to do walk-ins even if you're behind with your appointments. Some days you'll be overbooked and have 6 people wanting nail grinds, and others you'll have 1 appointment and no walk-ins. The holidays were especially stressful, I was overbooked for 3 months straight. The tips were great during the holidays, but I got next to nothing otherwise. If you don't plan on being a groomer, I wouldn't even bother working here as a bather. I quit because my hours were cut so bad that I couldn't pay my bills, while the girl who was bad at her job but planned on being a groomer was nearly full-time. My manager also slowly was starting to have the girl who has been there the longest work in the store unwillingly instead because she didn't want to be a groomer either. The new computer system does not limit the amount of dogs you can get booked like the old one did, so you can be stuck with 4 great pyrenees and a gsd in a 4 hour shift if it so desires. It's always very gossipy. You will get bit, peed on, clean up diarrhea vomit and blood, get sprayed with a*al gland fluid (really Indeed, this is inappropriate language?)...."

Then I would get them out in a timely manner but the management didn’t want to send me to academy. I was making the store more money than the other bathers I had potential in being a groomer.
PetSmart,1dekhm51qh3st800,2.0,"I would not recommend working here, very rude customers all the time, poor management, they dont take care of the employees, push so much work on you that isnt your job, all for minimum wage. They will still have you work even when the working conditions are against the law. Definitely a slave corporation."
PetSmart,1dekgg1beh3l5800,4.0,"Good culture, fun place to work. Knowledge about bet products and pets is a plus. Left for better pay. Smaller stores require multiple roles be filled by same person. Pretty busy at times."
PetSmart,1dekcna7bb8bt800,1.0,"I did not enjoy working here. The management only cares about money rather than the well being of the animals. They don't take the time to train and educate their employees, instead they just want you to push sales. They don't care about animals."
PetSmart,1dejb4ope1d0o000,4.0,"Most benefits as a groomer here are great I recommend giving it a go, even if you have zero grooming experience they WILL train you after a certain amount of time has passed. I personally left because of a store leader being an overall awful person and not because of the company itself."
PetSmart,1dej15nmvbrcp800,1.0,"Was let go after my availability changed. I was working two jobs, and told them my availability would be different, they begged me to stay when I put in my two weeks notice, then fired me when they felt like it."
PetSmart,1deik8t9rh414800,2.0,"It was fine until new management came in. They put feces in a trash can and leave it there, they refused to give me a sick day, and leave me with more dogs than one person should deal with. DO NOT WORK THE NIGHT SHIFTS."
PetSmart,1deic8uhibrcp800,2.0,"Often asked me to do things that werent part of my possition, nor what I was physically supposed to be doing. I.E. organizing the backstock of dog and or cat food during my shift dispite me having back problems (not supposed to lift more than arround 40lbs occasionally at most) as well as another employee with even worse back issues. I was only in pet care."
PetSmart,1deghva6n5j4t800,5.0,it's a great place to work and where you can be around animals fair management as well and a great co-worker where you can see each other as family and friends.
PetSmart,1deggu8p6h3l5800,4.0,Outsmart was one of the best jobs I had. Pay was low but you do have some raise opportunities. Its a fun environment to work at since you work with and around interesting people with similar interests
PetSmart,1defv3tngh3h3800,5.0,"Working at Petsmart was absolutely the best. Management was supportive, teamwork was fun. The job itself was productive, and our events were always packed and filled with joy."
PetSmart,1defpmb9h1d0o000,3.0,"The general vibe out on the floor of the store is really nice. Everyone knows everybody else, we joke with each other, and we stand by one another. They are well-trained, and they're chill with each other. In the back of house, it's a completely different story."
PetSmart,1defc5lfph3h3800,2.0,Not a big fan after management change. I loved working there until I stopped getting breaks and started getting told I would be there one in trouble for it even though it's the scheduling causing it
PetSmart,1def80kvd1d0o000,5.0,"Everything about the job is great ! Great management , co workers, it’s a great & welcoming environment. Everyone is so helpful and treats you like family."
PetSmart,1dedu3aqm1d0o000,1.0,"Petsmart would be a better place to work at if they didn't sell animals at all. They treat their animals worse than the employees. Small overcrowded cages in the back and every morning I would take out dead hamster because they would kill each other due to small cages. Management only really cares about numbers, not much job opportunities"
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1dedp80pmh3st800,5.0,"An typical day we would be clocking in, going to do the job, chat with co workers. Management was very helpful and understanding, a laid back enivorment. When at times we were short staffed co workers would always be a helping hand.The hardest part of the job was dealing with the animals. West La petsmart was a family, we could always depend on each other."
PetSmart,1dedo8raih3st800,4.0,I loved working at Petsmart. The first Salon I worked at was drama but once I switched stores it was a great time. The pets were great and the coworkers were awesome. Store managers can be kinda rude but the Salon managers are usually great.
PetSmart,1ded8f94bh3p9802,1.0,The company is behind and backs up computer forms with multiple paper forms. Most of the time is spent trying to fill out the paperwork when it’s right in the computer.  None of the systems talk to each other so you have to go to several different places to fill out one form.
PetSmart,1decept1v5n9t801,5.0,"A person must love animals to work here. There is an issue with communication between stores. Pay is not great, but decent. At times associates are asked to do more than is worth their pay."
PetSmart,1debnalqeh44u800,3.0,".Management not bad but could be better. Faster respond time to workers and customers. More staff for shifts so things flow more smoothly. Often times its just one cashier and one petcare, which can hold up people and often causes lines especially when closing."
PetSmart,1debg844rh3p9800,3.0,"PetSmart is a great place to work on the surface.  Great people throughout the retail store ranks.  Working with animals in a specialty retail environment is a plus.  Unfortunately, the business, and District Leaders have taken a stance on achieving metrics through negative reinforcement, outlier management, and multiple levels of unnecessary “action plans” (ie; writing people up).  The focus on customer service levels is what will help keep retailers relevant but not through “behavior manipulation”.  If PetSmart focused on what made them great, then they can be great again.  Spend more time and money on training the store teams to be the knowledgeable industry leaders that your customers expect them to be.  Help make the services teams job less stressful by removing the noise from their day to day work life and they can be productive and profitable as well."
PetSmart,1deb1lfgrh3p9800,3.0,Petsmart is a good job for anyone starting out and looking for work experience. The Company structure makes it difficult to advance quickly and even if you do advance the pay does not make the amount of work needed worth it.
PetSmart,1dears1cq5nek800,1.0,Do not recommend working here at all.  The pay is not good and they refuse to give you more hours. The managers will overwork you and never show that they appreciate you.
PetSmart,1dean7r4u1d0o000,3.0,They have 3 shifts with a minimum of 10hrs or work the weekends for 12hrs a day with 4 days off start time for 1st is 5:00am-4:00pm mon-fri 2nd start time is 4:30pm-3am mon-Fri also the weekends start 5:30am-530pm Fri-sun.
PetSmart,1deagsjl05nek800,3.0,"PetSmart, as anyone who has worked there knows, is a mixed experience. On one hand, anyone who loves animals like myself will enjoy working with the animals, customers and products in the store. I worked in nearly every position within the retail store and I enjoyed almost every one of them, especially working in pet care with the more exotic animals. Pay isn't terrible but isn't great; however I was able to frequently obtain overtime to make up for this. Most of my co-workers were great and I still have friends from there to this day."
PetSmart,1deagjra0h3st800,3.0,Depending on the store manager could be great can be bad.  You need to always be on the sales floor and available to customers.  Holidays are time and a half.
PetSmart,1de93g5s8b83o800,4.0,"The paid is pretty good, the employee's are great but management can differentiate between the different stores but some can be super harsh and not nice to the point of having issues with. Normally good customers but had a few who wanted to steal and or use fake money successfully. Overall it was a good time though meeting all the fun loving animals that walk in every day, a lot more nicer than some customers."
PetSmart,1de905losh3l5800,2.0,"A great place to work if you're interested in caring for a variety of animals. Coworkers and customers all care about animals. Outside of store management, it was obvious the corporation of petsmart couldn't care less about the employees or animals or even the customers. The district manager is insanely nitpicky about the smallest details and then will overlooking major issues in other petsmarts. Overall the corporation is awful at being fair and holding equal standards amongst other petsmarts. They are willing to let buildings fall apart and dont care about the health of the new animals we received."
PetSmart,1de8l82ml52u8800,1.0,Good work environment but no opportunity for growth or shift changes. I enjoyed my time at the company but management is no help when you have health and or family changes in your life outside of work
PetSmart,1de8ktopth414800,5.0,"I am hurt...it feels as if now I am the culprit and no longer the victim. Man, do I feel sad tonight. She supposedly cried because of something she stirred, but imagine how much my family and I feel. Cries can’t explain our hurt. No matter how it was explained to me, I know info that I told another one....was used not intentionally against me, but it is...I feel so stupid, but I can only swallow it because I myself engaged in gossip...it just didn’t feel so good when a Manager spoke my heart infused info"
PetSmart,1de865rtbb83o800,4.0,"Petsmart was very accommodating in many senses. A typical day would vary depending on if I worked the register or in the grooming salon. The register handled greeting customers, answering phones, answering customers questions along with directing them to anything they may need help finding. Cleaning the register area and keeping aisles in order would be done once I arrived to work and maintained throughout the shift. In the grooming salon I would make appointments, handle walk-ins, bathe any animals I had for the day, along with helping my coworkers with any animals they may need help with. The register is secluded from much coworker interaction whereas the grooming salon is much different in that aspect. The hardest thing to handle would be an upset customer since they can be difficult to please once they're upset with an item or service. On the flip side, the customers can also be the best part of the day, especially when you build rapport with them and you both end up making each other's day better."
PetSmart,1de7so5lnh3st800,5.0,"Working there is easy but there is a lot to do. in petcare you take care of every animal on the floor, sick ones, new ones, also customer service, meaning having to get crickets and fish, and showing animals."
PetSmart,1de7rcqgmh3p9800,5.0,I had a good experience at PetSmart.  The staff was helpful and friendly.  We worked well together and the management supported us with any guidance necessary.
PetSmart,1de6mk00fh414800,4.0,"Petsmart was a fun place to work, with some really great people. Corporate really takes care if it’s employees, and makes sure everyone is treated with respect:"
PetSmart,1de5scipgb83o800,5.0,Love work there. Managers and coworkers were great. Sad to go but i was pregnant at the time so had to go. They had told me I could go back but right know with my  availability it wouldn’t work for me.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1de5b4qj91d0o002,5.0,True leadership role where you are able to hold your team accountable. 65+ employees and a team of 14 managers. The GM for this type of role is acting more as an HR representative.
PetSmart,1de38u3d2b83o800,1.0,Petsmart did not give groomers any say in how they were scheduled dogs and would often allow severe overbooking which would cause a lack of quality in our grooms. full availability was required and time off requests were often denied.  They also would take promotional pricing out of the groomers pay
PetSmart,1de2e11slh3kl800,5.0,Working at PetSmart is fun.  There is always something to do so the days go by super fast.  It is a fun environment especially with all of the animals that come shopping with the pet parents.
PetSmart,1de1c7fksh3oq800,1.0,"Managers will allow customers to yell, cuss, belittle you in front of other people whether or not you did something wrong, Then proceed to blame you. Most of them do not care for the lives of the animals only about sales and conversion. Managers will yell at you themselves, have no regard for your health or families if you try to call out. Will refuse you official two week notice and then proceed to fire you."
PetSmart,1de159i3nh3kl800,2.0,"If you want to gain experience in animal care for minimum wage and minimal hours, PetSmart is the place to work. The dogs are great, the customers are wonderful, the company itself... needs improvement. They provide wonderful training videos, updated weekly. However, if you wish to receive a living wage, you may want to look elsewhere. Its a great environment for entry level experience in animal care. Though PetSmart lacks the ability to fairly compensate it's employees."
PetSmart,1de10der2b83o800,3.0,Petsmart is a good company to work for. However it doesn’t make time for people that have families. Especially when it’s your personal life and your step kids that you only get to see twice a month.
PetSmart,1ddvnbtvl52t7800,4.0,I don't hold a management role but am given the responsibility of updating and educating my colleagues on policy changes. Any threat of corporate and the managers are giving you lists of things to complete that would take atleast 4 people to finish in the 4 hour time period given.
PetSmart,1ddvld8g2b83o800,4.0,Petsmart is a lot of fun and a lot of work. Yes you get to play with dogs and cats but you also need to do your work. You gain a lot of working experience here. There’s room to move up. The managers and supervisors are great. The customers well your daily customers are the best. They always bring us treats. During the holidays it’s the worst but it’s manageable. Flexible schedule. The only time it sucks is when you get customers who think they can boss you around and try to be little you.
PetSmart,1ddv84ogah3kl800,3.0,"Discount is standard 15% except on their rare 30% days, which helps if you have pets. Worked in the grooming salon and most of the people were pleasant and seemed to care about clients and their pets, but the few who didn't got away with a lot before Petsmart finally terminated them. Many groomers treat bathers badly, even though most of us start out in that position before becoming groomers--bossing them around, not wanting to give them space to work, unwilling to help them when they need it, acring better/more important."
PetSmart,1ddu9b6qi5n91800,5.0,I always loved working at Petsmart it was always fun and I excelled in my department. Petsmart is one of the best animal retail companies in my opininon.
PetSmart,1ddtvr9g2h44g800,5.0,Working at Petsmart is awesome. We are like a family there. It’s amazing to be able to worm with a group of fast paced and talented people while at the same time feeling at home.
PetSmart,1ddtmd6na5nde800,3.0,"Working with animals and customers who love animals is fun, but PetSmart has few opportunities for advancement and you're expected to work too hard for what you're paid."
PetSmart,1ddtlkncoh3oq800,4.0,Can be hard if your not competitive theres a lot of matches to see who can get the most of everything and than the manager say you won they dont give you the prize
PetSmart,1ddror2hqh44g800,5.0,"There were Tons of opportunities to lean and grow. Close to home, easy commute.  I worked as s cashier, aquatics dept, grooming and on the sales floor."
PetSmart,1ddqvl9llh40k802,1.0,"Petsmart is a company that only cares about the money it earns and not the people who work for them. They will run you into the ground with work and keep adding to your original roll that you sign on for without asking. HR complaints aren’t taken seriously. They fight workers comp claims that take place and have video proof of. Overall a terrible company to work for, don’t do this to yourself no matter how bad you need a job."
PetSmart,1ddqp9l3bb88o800,3.0,For the most part I enjoyed PetSmart.  I enjoyed the opportunity to work with pets and learn more about them. Typical days could be slow or fast paced.  Like most jobs they each have their ups and downs but nothing drastic.
PetSmart,1ddplndqnb85e800,1.0,"I was dismissed from my job for being on my cell phone. Everyone was on their cell phones. I have Asperger’s syndrome and struggle with social cues, and did not receive clear direction from my supervisor. It was the best job in the world until the new supervisor arrived. I haven’t been able to secure a job since I left."
PetSmart,1ddpgq7abb89a800,1.0,"This used to be a good place to work at. However, current management has personal intentions in mind rather than the overall business. There is favoritism among leadership and if you are not in the good graces you have to work even harder to just maintain a neutral status. The goals set can be very difficult to meet. Even if goals are met you are told that you can do better."
PetSmart,1ddpfnm8424gh000,1.0,"poor animal Care policy enforcement. Animals/fish constantly dying due to habitat issues left unresolved. Poor building upkeep.. i.e: blood on floors, uncleaned urine/feces. No supervision for employees by upper-management. Just not a pleasant place to work. Gossip encouraged/repeated by upper-management, favoritism,"
PetSmart,1ddp2g60724fg000,3.0,I loved the job when I first started. Weekends and nights are always the busiest. Love seeing all the animals who come in and out. Loved petting them and giving them treats. Registers are easy to use.

PetSmart,1ddmnrosc5ncv800,3.0,This place is always booming with customers. Even slow days feel jam packed. Just come to work and don't get involved in the drama and you'll do well.
PetSmart,1ddm9l0do24ej000,3.0,"I  started off in the grooming salon, random 4 hour shifts here and there because they weren't busy. Worked my butt off for minimum wage but at least there are puppies"
PetSmart,1ddm9h3b05j7p802,4.0,When I worked there I had a positive experience with my coworkers and  the job it's self I loved my customers but the management definitely needs improvement.
PetSmart,1ddlvkvk05n8h800,4.0,Pretty standard job there are chances to move up in the company if you're willing to relocate. corporate can be a little demanding at times and change some of the things for the worse but overall a fine job
PetSmart,1ddlse8mk24e0000,5.0,I learned a lot about pets and common problems they have. Managers are not strict. The worst part about the job is that it can be boring and the air is very dry and dusty. I love greeting all the dogs that come in and taking to people about there pets.
PetSmart,1ddjeli0j5j7p800,3.0,"Customer driven focus company, short work days. Great for starting a career. Open management environment, cares about their workers. Every month you learn something new about the company culture through mandatory videos."
PetSmart,1ddj03otn24f4000,5.0,i love watching dogs a lot so its fun to work there and its a great place to work at all the animals there there sooo cute and cuddly they are fluffy and non fluffy too omg animals i love them they have pretty eyes and are big medium and small
PetSmart,1ddiupkh224e0000,4.0,"Loved the job and the people and pets , it was a fun and friendly place to work. I would not have left but had very bad management . All the people worked as a team ."
PetSmart,1ddib73q6b835800,5.0,"Working with PetSmart has been a wonderful experience which is why I have been there for the past 6 years, but like everyone else in life I’m striving for something better. Petsmart has always been good to me and I know this company is a place I can always rely on for a job. I’m seeking a full time job."
PetSmart,1ddhoijmth3v8800,3.0,They take half of your commission and off discount that comes out of your half of your commission. I felt like I was getting robbed.they did have good benefits and offered groomers discounts
PetSmart,1ddhnpbrsh473800,1.0,"It’s fun to work there, but if you aren’t into the drama and gossip they will make you apart of it. Managers hang with associates when they aren’t supposed to. Favoritism and retaliation happens way too often. Thank you but no thank you."
PetSmart,1ddhmh41rb83u800,2.0,Used to be about the pets the company is now directed into making the metrics. Work life balance as a manager is nill. I was talked about negatively while I was morning.the loss of my husband by my superior.
PetSmart,1ddg5glkn5j6t800,1.0,I enjoyed petsmart to an extent. But once the most recent assistant manager took over it just went down hill. Hours were cut because you werent her favorite. Or if they had no one scheduled for someones lunch time they would schedule someone who lived 30 minutes away to come in for an hour of work
PetSmart,1ddf5b74th3v8800,3.0,It can be a great job for high school students and for anyone that is in college but management isn’t so great. They really need work because some of their attitudes are making the place a bad place to work. No room for advancement. I can say a lot more but I’ll keep it to myself.
PetSmart,1dde46ougbrf9800,2.0,"Petsmart was a good opportunity while putting myself through school, but has become increasingly poorly managed. Management doesn't care about you and workers aren't properly paid for what's asked of them. The only reason I stayed for so long was because of the dogs."
PetSmart,1dddvpqjhb8ba800,5.0,"Petsmart was my favorite job, my co workers were very helpful and positive to work with. It was overall a great experience. I would recommend working there to anyone."
PetSmart,1ddcq5oa6h3n6800,1.0,I liked working here at first. I’ve been with the company for over a year now and here is what I’ve noticed over time:
PetSmart,1ddcdudrs5nfd800,3.0,Low pay for the responsibilities and hours of work. With little to no opportunities for promotion. It was hard to make ends meat with what they paid..
PetSmart,1ddbipnqtb854800,4.0,Overall I enjoyed my experience working with petsmart. I was fresh out of high school and was looking for a job where I could work with animals while I was going to school. This job is perfect for people who are animal lovers and have great customer service skills.
PetSmart,1ddb80eel5nfd800,3.0,The main reason why I left was due to the poor management skills at PetSmart. Not to say the managers were bad people or treated me unfairly its just that they were always late to do things/forgot.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1dda0fv0d5nb6800,4.0,I love my job it goes from quick pace to slow pace but during quick pace other employees are always willing to help out. It’s a very relaxed job and customers are amazing
PetSmart,1dd9rlklqh3j5800,5.0,Overall a great and friendly place to work.  You can bring your pets with you to work.  The culture in the corporate headquarters and field operations is great.
PetSmart,1dd9r055kh473800,1.0,petsmart was okay to work for but the managers made it terrible. they didn't back you up with customers where in wrong. and never wanted to help when we needed it.
PetSmart,1dd9puc8mb83u800,3.0,They expected you do groom 7 to 8 dogs a day average in and 8 hour work day 4 dogs in the morning with an hour lunch in between and 3 or 4 dogs in the afternoon. Averaging about an hour for each bath dry and cut per dog impossible. Estimated pick up time was 2 to 3 hours of a dog but when you have 4 dogs to do in those 3 hours it’s impossible. I often would not eat lunch and would just clock out and wash dogs on my lunch hour
PetSmart,1dd925p225j6t800,1.0,This was a nice place to work it's just it's kind of like a Shooting Gallery and having an employee to tell you one thing and then GM tell you another that is not okay. there needs to be more Consistency.
PetSmart,1dd8ii45fh3n6800,2.0,I WOULD NOT recommend working here. Especially in the grooming salon. If you are starting as a bather and have hope in becoming a groomer let me start by saying they don't pay you very well nor give you many hours. They do not train very well or at all. The salon manager was a joke. She was suppose to be training new employees and helping current ones and she was not doing so. Non of the employees take their job seriously. They violate company policy often by texting/ being on their cell phones even while grooming peoples pets. There is no team work. Instead of being supportive and helping one another they have attitudes towards one another. The bathers and new employees in the salon get treated the worst. The way they treat you is disrespectful and act like they're better than you. It makes for a VERY hostile work environment. The store management isn't helpful and instead plays favorites. Its all one big joke. So if you're looking to become a groomer / bather. Don't go to PetSmart. At least not that location.
PetSmart,1dd7dpkgvb83u800,4.0,"Petsmart is an amazing experience. Fast paced, pay is good, paid time off and flexible with your schedule. They take great care of their employees and customers"
PetSmart,1dd76cvamh3j5800,3.0,"The flies and other critters in the store are enough to make you think twice. Do not expect validation for hard work. Do not expect compensation for being the hardest working. Any way Petsmart can avoid giving you money; example, not offering full time, cutting hours during slow seasons, cutting pay increase at time of pay review, managements inability to acknowledge your hard work to people in authority. They use bug zappers and fly strips instead of implementing healthy cleaning routines. And when someone tries to go above expectations with cleaning, coworkers take advantage and leave a lot for you to clean. Not a team environment at all, with no support system from upper management. I was super disappointed after working there for more than half the year."
PetSmart,1dd761m5qh3rb800,4.0,The head manager was a very nice and understanding man and flexible to work with and for! It was all about the animals and helping someone find a pet.
PetSmart,1dd6mfrelh3n6800,3.0,company used to have a good management set up but it has been restructured and they dont offer enough help to management or current employees in the workplace
PetSmart,1dd6eau9qb854800,5.0,I loved working at petsmart. I started as a cashier and left a pet care associate. It’s a fun place to work if you like animals and like helping people find solutions to their pet care needs!
PetSmart,1dd66j7tuh438800,2.0,Managers weren't the best. After working there for three years I received an 11 cent raise (woohoo!). So sad. I also was the leader in salon sales for my district. Glad I got out of there.
PetSmart,1dd6654q3h3v8800,2.0,"Typical day was coming in at 5 or 6 AM, open the store and do computer work, make the daily schedule, open drawers, then shoot consumables holes and part of hardgoods depending on the day. No help typically, so very stressful to get all of this done on time. Then typically short staffed all morning, so it was mostly getting pulled away to help customers, while attempting to get Planograms set, pricing done, and a million other additional tasks payroll didn’t account for. Never enough stocking hours, and it was made clear that stocking was a priority, but then nothing else would get done and customer service would suffer. I’ve seen this position destroy 2 others, and now it has destroyed me. My team was awesome for the most part, some of my best friends, but the position is extremely stressful and not worth the pay. Health insurance is expensive and not even worth it. No one would help with my department because they were all in the same boat, with too much to do. Company needs to figure itself out, and I’m tired of waiting. Too many dumb misteps and focus on apps and computer programs that barely work. Nobody here is not stressed out on the daily. Good job for part time college kids, and that’s about it."
PetSmart,1dd5bupb55nb6800,3.0,"I have learned a lot about the PetSmart company. I have learned different job function while with the company. While, its great that I know these job functions it also has drawbacks. The culture at petsmart is very customer oriented."
PetSmart,1dd53bg93h46q800,2.0,"They want you to spend the rest of your life as a groomer, if you go through there grooming academy they own you for 3 years now. When you want to leave they act like you are betraying them and everything they've done for you. Job security is nice but only because they don't want to train a replacement. The pay is good but the drama hardly makes it worth is. They are pretty quick to blame the groomer for anything that goes wrong with the hair cut. For example if you can't trim the nail because they dog is biting and stressing out they will blame you for checking it in in the first place."
PetSmart,1dd4qski3h3mg800,5.0,I  had a great time and really saw life from a different view working with great people day in and day out. They are still my friends to this day that I have come to rely on to this day.
PetSmart,1dd4mqoid5nao800,5.0,Enjoyable work if you have a passion for animals and enjoy working around people. Very satisfying to know you can educate someone to the better care of their pet.
PetSmart,1dd4fs07dh3uh800,4.0,"Cared for all animals in the store, stocked shelves, cleaned after animals, provided customer service, work the cashier, scrub tanks, take pets to vet."

PetSmart,1dd3s8hmdh3mg800,5.0,Some days at work it can be stressful if it's busy and we weren't given the hours for an extra hand but overall I enjoy working at PetSmart. I enjoy the team environment where we all actually work as a team.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1dd3bvfubh3ql800,4.0,"PetSmart was a good place to work except for my manager at the time. It was a lot of work, but rewarding seeing the happy dogs and other animals that came in."
PetSmart,1dd2g1vs6brdk800,3.0,"Working here was nice, I enjoyed the customers and my previous coworkers. I went to school as a veterinary assistant and I was working here for more experience working with pets. This was my first ""real"" job so I don't quite remember all of the benefits. I was part time while going to college."
PetSmart,1dd1uv2kkh3ql800,4.0,"The PetSmart that I work at is a fun place to work. The people that work there are friendly and helpful. Very flexible with scheduling, although sometimes scheduling gets mixed up but is fixed once it is brought up."
PetSmart,1dd1pgkafb825802,4.0,"All my coworkers were incredibly nice and welcoming, and the pets are the best part of the entire job. I generally stayed busy, with plenty customers and appointments. The most difficult part of the job would be the bathers taking all walk in services and their own scheduled appointments, making time management essential. Poor management is the only reason I would advise caution when applying."
PetSmart,1dd1mnh50h3ih800,5.0,"PetSmart has the best options to work with animals and people alike. The company is very kind about working with you if you have a family emergency, illness, or personal situation. The way they apply their policy on the care of pets and pet parents are amazing. I would recommend working for this company."
PetSmart,1dd1m3ihcb878804,2.0,"I wanted to work here because I love animals and thought this would be a great place to work to be around them. I learned quickly that the company cares more about profit than the pets. Although I know they do need to care about money to be a successful company, I feel as if that was put above the safety of the pets on numerous occasions. The grooming salon was a big example of this. The pet would be there for over 6 hours normally for a groom that would take only a fraction of that time. They are put in a kennel with no bathroom breaks. The goal of the salon is clearly to just get as many dogs in there as possible, even though it causes intense stress to so many of them. I used to take my dog to get groomed there, but after working here I would never recommend it to anybody."
PetSmart,1dcuksebqh41t800,2.0,you only work with 2 other people in the store so every shift you only have 3 one manager and 2 employees. Part time workers only get less than 20 hours and have to beg to get more hours in a day you only work 4-5 hours.
PetSmart,1dcukn1ith3ts800,3.0,"PetSmart was okay to work for. I was hired to be a care associate, but was told I had to train on the register for a week before they would move me over. I worked there for 6 months and never once got moved off the cash register. Salary is minimum and not a livable wage."
PetSmart,1dcuj3opn5na4800,2.0,"Your hours always change, they want you to sell sell sell and if you don’t meet what they expect they say they will write you up. Well you can’t make someone buy something. When your a groomer if it’s the winter you don’t make any money. But near holidays and summer you can make a lot if you put your all into it. Bathrooms are always nasty, there is never the same people there for long."
PetSmart,1dcu86vuih3lt800,4.0,This was a great first job for me! I loved seeing all the animals and the customers were great as well! I very much enjoyed my time working for this company! Very relaxing job!
PetSmart,1dcstlu32h45p800,2.0,"The longer you work for PetSmart the more you see wrong with the company. Store level and corporate care more about money, than the pets. The pet care animals are not taking care of properly. PetSmart Care Guides offer awful advice, and PetSmart gives awful training for this department especially. Everything I was taught was incorrect, and had to learn proper care on my own outside of work."
PetSmart,1dcsrhnju52u3800,1.0,Hostile work environment. Rude and unfair management. Select staff are mean to the animals. Dirty and crowded work environment. It’s a dog eat dog place and I do not recommend working there.
PetSmart,1dcskd0c1b87r800,3.0,"No matter how many complaints and concerns you put in to management, the problems will not get fixed and your hours will probably get cut for speaking up for yourself. The employees are extremely friendly and helpful but there is no managing in the manager department."
PetSmart,1dcsg1st1b87r800,4.0,Working at Petsmart was a very fun and satisfying job. You get to be around a lot of different animals which makes the job much more fun. The management and coworkers are very upbeat and nice to be around.

PetSmart,1dcs82i3oh45p800,4.0,The management staff doesn't really help the other workers. They sit in the office most of the day and eat.............................................
PetSmart,1dcqel03l5na4800,3.0,Petsmart has a good balance for the first time employee. The part time hours allow you to still have a social life or attend school. The advancement may take a while to obtain and the work load on certain job areas can be very stressful. The management through corporate made getting the tasks assigned to specific shifts difficult to complete and put undue pressure on other employees/management. Management staff are stressed and can be abrasive when dealing with employees or customers.
PetSmart,1dcqbi78t5na4800,1.0,"The location I worked in was horrible. It's very understaffed, as a cashier I would be on the register by myself with lines that went to the back of the store. The Assistant manager was incompetent; he would schedule me for closings""literally"" every week until I left. Furthermore, he would forget to assign a opening cashier because he didn't know how to allot hours properly. Since we were understaffed customers were very irate and rude. This is because of the long lines and excessive waiting. Also, we left extremely late because the manager would schedule 3 people to close out a store that's about 15,000 square feet,( in other words a very big store with very little manpower.)"
PetSmart,1dcq8q058h45p800,3.0,"Management sucks, they don’t give you many hours or they give you a ton. It’s really busy and stressful sometimes. They don’t communicate very well at all and customers can really suck sometimes. But that’s the usual. It’s an okay part time job. I wouldn’t recommend being a groomer because you have to stay there for 2 years after you’re trained or else they’ll make you pay for the training."
PetSmart,1dcpl9tfuh45p800,4.0,"It was just a weekend job for me so the people liked me but not as much as the ones that worked all the time. So wasn't sad to quit. work was fine but boring, only fun when people let you touch their dogs."

PetSmart,1dcnqn7oqb833800,3.0,"When i started i was told i would be given a schedule. About a month in they said i wouldn't have a set schedule. Couple weeks later, we set up a meeting and they pulled me out of the salon saying it wasn't entertaining and threw me onto the store floor. I don't work 20-25 hours a week and they never give me straight answers."
PetSmart,1dcng7s0sh3q4800,3.0,"I like grooming because I get a lot of satisfaction out of helping the dogs stay healthy and watching them grow. I have customers that come to see me on a regular basis with their pups because they trust me. Whether they are tough to deal with or perfect angels, I love all my clients. The most enjoyable part of my job is to bring dogs out of the kennels to walk with their heads held high to the parents and see the owners strong loving reaction to their freshly pampered pups. However, some dogs come in who are obviously neglected. They are matted, covered in urine in a crate, and some owners even hit them in the lobby. It is hard to explain to the pet parents that what they are doing is harmful and having them walk out or ignore me only to continue neglecting their dogs. The environment is hard to deal with as most employees would rather be anywhere else. The employees always joke about quitting or going on lunch and never coming back. Most days go smoothly though, usually I have lots to do or keep myself busy by cleaning, maintaining equipment, and/or helping out in other departments."
PetSmart,1dcmvpbqah3lt800,1.0,The company is money hungry and treats its employees like slaved.  Management is terrible and nothing is ever done about it.  They don’t pay enough and drastically cut your pay if you don’t sell enough in commission that week.
PetSmart,1dcmu30v75nea800,4.0,"Way too much work, favoritisms among staff. Personally I like the company but my current coworkers aren’t team players. Of course I’m sure not every store is like that. Way too much focus in customer service not completing tasks. Unrealistic goals."
PetSmart,1dcmt30925nea802,3.0,company is great to work for gives you alot of working its fasted paced and also lifting alot of heavy food and dog food. you get PTO and all of the other benefits
PetSmart,1dcmn41q45nea800,4.0,"Small staff, very little close management, a little lonely at times due to the independent nature of the job. It is enjoyable to work with the animals, but again, you are working completely alone most of the time, so it gets quiet and boring particularly during afternoons."
PetSmart,1dcmlr00b5na4800,4.0,"Pay could be better, hours were kept 30 minutes under 40 so you didn’t get benefits but worked full time hours, store manager at the time was so bad/condescending most of the staff quit within a month of him starting."
PetSmart,1dcmje9ukh3lt800,3.0,"Petsmart was an okay place to work at if you want to do a lot of work and never get the opportunity to move up.they will always pick an outside candidate, so they don’t have to fill in for your job. They give you a lot of responsibility with little pay. And will alter your hours so you don’t get overtime."
PetSmart,1dcmeeab9h45p800,2.0,"Its not environment well received, quirky people who may seem nice, after a while quite burn out people leave ,"
PetSmart,1dcllumulbrem800,4.0,It's a great place to work. You get to learn great customer service skills while working in a stressful and loud environment. It gives many opportunities to learn about different types of pet care
PetSmart,1dckvbvqp5n9v800,1.0,"I have been a employee for the past year and 3/4 months. The store overall is fantastic. When I started last year, the management was absolutely perfect. I started February 2018. Since February 2018, many changes came around. Management changed. The whole store went down hill. By that, I mean, I can name up to 15+ employees that has left since February 2018 that have been there for either 6 months, 2 years, or up to 6 years because of the new management. The management is very unprofessional. Again, the store overall is fantastic, but management is awful; and unprofessional. And their customer service is awful.  This would NOT be a place I recommend to work. Also this place can no longer hold a staff. We lost 5 people in the salon back to back and could not hold a salon manager. We’ve went through 2 salon managers the past 4 months and we’ve went through 15+ people in retail the last year over the new management, if that tells you anything. This review is mainly for anyone looking for a job here. Just a warning. I’m not the person to leave a job and I wanted to make a career out of Petsmart. But along with 15+ employees that left this job because of management; I was one of them."
PetSmart,1dckmnte05ne6800,4.0,fast pace  long hours  decent training  but could be improved   good job if you work hard  pay raises could be better   based on  over all work and attendance

PetSmart,1dcjbls6652u0800,4.0,"I find PetSmart to be a relaxing place to work and if you enjoy working with animals and helping customers with their issues concerning their pets and meeting those pets, you'll like this job."
PetSmart,1dcioq9bvh3q1800,3.0,"PetSmart can be a fun place to work at depending on your position and your management team. When I worked as a PetCare Associate, part time, my biggest complaint was that the training was virtually nonexistent. The manager told me that I would have 2 weeks of training, which from my previous employment, that meant 10 days or 14 days, PetSmart meant your first 2 weeks regardless of days and hours worked. Despite the early hours, when I was part time, and later full time, stock my manager was amazing and the best manager I ever had. I worked hard, but it felt relaxed, though the pay was terrible and I was a bit sore that the new hires were getting hired in at more than what I was making even after a year! When I got promoted to the Merchandise and Inventory Leader I was excited, but didn't realize that I could be as stressed as I was. I started with no stock team and went through one team before getting a solid team I felt confident in. Just so those reading know, a Merchandise and Inventory Lead at PetSmart means that you are a Receiving Manager, Stocking Manager, Inventory Controller/Manager, Merchandise/Presentation Manager, and an Assistant Store Manager all in one so you're responsible for almost the whole store and depending on your manager depends on the help you will get. My manager, I felt, was not too great and the District Manager/Lead was not much help in promoting teamwork. My manager would often ask me what I needed to help get things done better and more efficiently and often my answer was that I needed more help whether that was more team members or help from others"
PetSmart,1dcig9am452u0800,1.0,"Management sucks, pay sucks. You are expected to do more things than any 1 person can actually do and dont get paid enough to do it. The company doesnt care about the employee or the customers or the pets...they only care about money and sales."
PetSmart,1dci64ik7b87o801,2.0,Very competitive when it comes to getting into management from a normal employee. It's very fun working with the animals and seeing all sorts of different animals coming in to work!
PetSmart,1dchp7eu35n9v800,1.0,I was employed as a bather- the grunt job of the salon- answered calls- gave dogs baths- cleaned kennels- did nail files- basically did all the work the groomers did not want to do - for $8 and hour while they made 50% commission on everything-was promised a chance to go to grooming school after a few months as a bather- NOT happening- worked all weekends- never missed any time- ultimately to be lied to - every time a position would open for groomer- someone else was hired from the outside-

PetSmart,1dchcn230h3q1800,1.0,"I love dogs!  So working in the hotel here was great for that reason. Sadly, that’s the only positive about this location. There’s zero opportunity for a raise, or advancement ever. As they routinely will bring in a stranger for a new job instead of advancing a qualified employee that’s worked internally for years. There are rules here like all jobs, and they are more than loosely followed. I wouldn’t trust my own pet at this hotel and that’s pretty scary considering I worked here. If your dog has high energy that dog will be considered a nuisance and stay in a cage all day instead of playing in day camp. Employees abuse water bottles because they are lazy and play on their phones instead of interacting with the pups. Dog fights happen way too often because actual aggressive dogs are never punished or banned like they should be. Management has noooo idea how to do anything competent besides make the schedule.. and they even routinely mess that up somehow. The employees that work hard get taken advantage of and are asked to “do more,” while the lazy kids just get ignored and get away with being lazy. Management often hires their outside of work friends and then they all stand in the lobby most of their shift talking about their weekend while others are sweating in the back getting things done. Sorry... there’s just nothing great I can say about this Petsmart and especially the hotel in the store."
PetSmart,1dch98q0kb87o800,4.0,Very inconsistent hours. Great place other than that. Easy work and nice people. They try as hard as they can to make it a team effort and not just collect your paycheck and go. They pressure you way too much about sales and different discounts to the point where you're worried if they are going to give you less hours if you are low on sales or something.
PetSmart,1dch4hkkjh3lq800,5.0,I would recommend anyone looking to work with animals and very nice people to work at Pet Smart either full time or part time.
PetSmart,1dcfrm1qoh3hm800,2.0,"Very hard to earn pay raises, a lot of work as a petcare associate for little pay. Management was very rude and unorganized. Have to have some customer service  and retail experience but they do not require any prior animal medicine experience."
PetSmart,1dcfd3hg75n9q800,3.0,My situation at Petsmart was not typical. They are clearly trying to weed out and get rid of full time workers. I only had full time because of my former manager. The current one would not have given it to me. Customer care is all the company cares about and it is very stressful to find the time to accomplish other work tasks and have the managers be happy with your balance between customer assistance and work efficiency.
PetSmart,1dcf6f4nmbref801,1.0,"Petsmart grooming is easily the worst work experience any groomer can go through. Sure, get your base training there and then leave. You are selling yourself short in the grooming industry if you continue to work for this company. They hire ill-equipt management and corporate doesn't care about your job or well-being at all. You will hit a wall with your skill level and will not advance personally or within the company. There are other places you can work that offer full benefits. Consider a vet. I work for a vet now making $1100-1500/week and have full health, dental, vision, and PTO, and weekends off. I only talk to clients briefly in the morning to discuss haircut and that's it. Front desk does all check in and check out and appointments/phone calls. Petsmart's service side is going under anyway. Leave and stop allowing this company to exploit your skilled labor."
PetSmart,1dcf5ekihb86k800,5.0,"I stared as a cashier when I first got hired, friendly staff and environment, pet parents where always nice and eager to have a better understanding of their pets, later I promoted to pet care associate and worked with taking care as well as selling animals for a forever hone"

The pay was low and the hours sucked but I knew that going into the role of a stocker at a pet store. The thing I was unprepared for was how cavalier the managers would be about employee safety. The final straw was when management insisted we unload a truck during a black out with handheld lanterns, I couldn't work in a place that disregarded employee safety to that extent, operating a pallet jack one handed is unsafe and operating a forklift in low visibility could get someone killed."

Was expected to clean all the cages, care for sick animals, stock items, customer service, cashier work, care for all of the animals, for only 12.50 an hour. I requested for my position to be changed due to misunderstanding and it was denied. I left because of the horrible pay and enormous responsibility. I would have stayed if it was 15 an hour for all of those responsibilities. I also had to recommend food i knew was not good. Hours were good  especially if you are a student (although early, mostly 7-1 or 7-3) or closing shifts, but pay sucks. If you work as a cashier, then work for petsmart, dont do petcare unless you want enormous  responsibility  for horrible pay. Cashiers are paid to practically do nothing."

PetSmart,1dc36eeem24fe000,4.0,"I think it's a great place to work if you're young and you genuinely love pets. But you have to know how to handle the animals too. Don't just go in there thinking it's a walk in the park and you can pet dogs all day. It's actual work and needs serious effort. Remember you're caring for other people's pets here. There's many things that can go wrong, not necessarily your fault - but you better be prepared and know how to handle it. Panicking isn't gonna help anything. Things ran pretty smoothly at my location and management was okay too, but I'm sure it varies. Everyone's different. I will say the hiring process took unusually long (about 3 weeks). They're slow to hire even when they're short staffed."

I have great managers, but they often get into certain moods where they complain about everything. I have a manager now that is always texting and doesn't seem to like it there. I don't mind, but the manager will be there for hours before me on there phone, but as soon as I arrive, I have to do 5 things. I understand that it is my job to be ordered around, but I think it seems unfair to do absolutely nothing in my department until I get there. If the managers were a little more nice and actually liked their jobs, it'd be way better. My last manager was always doing things and thinking of ways to better our department and help the animals. I do however love my co-workers. They are nice and bring in food at random for everyone."

PetSmart,1dbvk5el724ge000,5.0,"Great place to work and learn about animals and retail experience. Quick paced and career advancement is a goal for the company, they like to promote within. Must be willing to learn quickly and on your toes."
PetSmart,1dbtho4mk24fp000,3.0,"• Provide in store customer service, responsible for the health and safety of the pets. Preformed"
PetSmart,1dbt7j32o24g9000,3.0,I enjoyed my job and the team I worked with. the benefits and hours could have been better. I took pride in being apart of the PetSmart team. The only negative thing I can think of is there wasn't an opportunity to work full-time at the location I was employed.
PetSmart,1dbsn6fq70mcn000,4.0,"Although some people may say it’s an awful place to work, I think that the atmosphere is a great place especially if you are an animal lover like me. I think that we could have been paid a little bit more, but we never really had to go on strike or anything, so overall, I thought pet smart was good."
PetSmart,1dbr52tpa24eo000,1.0,"New management and current management are terrible. They Make you feel like you’re unable to do your job. They will pick you out personally. Hypocritical, unreasonable, and disrespectful and I will never return."
PetSmart,1dbqvebq90mcn000,1.0,"the newest store manager harassed me terribly after i left the job while i was pregnant, i almost needed a restraining order. he would be sure to tell everyone in the store to be awful to me because of made up things he told them."
PetSmart,1dbqpmrp2b88l800,3.0,The overall job is great with the basic expectations however there is a knee jerk reaction to chase whatever hot button a senior leader deems as the next must comply item.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1dbpbm1tn24eo000,3.0,"Only managers and groomers are full-time. Employees are typically treated fairly. Managers are put under lots of stress by district managers and higher-ups, which stresses employees. You have to work OVER 9 hours to get an hour lunch break, or else only 30 minutes (so no one gets an hour break). Corporate does not support their store managers decisions regarding customers, even when store managers are putting corporate's policies into effect."
PetSmart,1dborvij9brcm800,1.0,Terrible management. The pay is bad and the employees are unfriendly. No one shows you what to do. You are always having to ask what to do next. And managers just don't care if you learn any new skills.
PetSmart,1dbokguon24g9000,4.0,"This job is fun and rewarding, it just didn't pay as much as it should have for the amount of work that you are required to do as a dog bather. Otherwise, I really enjoyed working at Petsmart. The dogs are amazing!"
PetSmart,1dbob5aqr24g9000,5.0,"If you like, loud, wet and noisy then this is the place to work for you!"
PetSmart,1dbo813ol24gs000,2.0,Petsmart always starts with the lowest pay possible and raises and such are so small it barley makes a difference. They are very cheep and offer too few opportunities to move up in the company.
PetSmart,1dblu3v7324f9000,1.0,"Management seemed like they didn't know how to run the company nor did they listen to their employees. Instead of helping you better yourself and your associates, they would rather show you the door. Would not recommend working in this establishment to my worst enemy. Unfortunately, I could not leave willingly due to expenses."
PetSmart,1dblrvgoj24g9000,3.0,I worked in the grooming salon and it is great becuase you get to work with dogs but the owners are a bit nutty. This salon is aslo very busy and quite demanding of their expectations of you.
PetSmart,1dblhtm7f24f9000,4.0,I personally didn’t like working for petsmart because management treated staff very unfairly. They cause a lot of the work drama that goes around. It can be a very uncomfortable environment.
PetSmart,1dbisujva24eo000,5.0,Excellent place to work.  I love everyone I work with.  The hours are very flexible and they will work with you on your schedule.  The pay is very appropriate for the job done.
PetSmart,1dbiigj3324gs000,1.0,This company puts on a lot of good charity and friendly attitude but when it comes down to it they are all about the money in the end.
PetSmart,1dbibi45824e9000,3.0,"I love this job and enjoy working with pets. The thing that blows is management, they have no compassion for the salon members, hire new people and give them all the hours. Where the people in the salon are forced to look for new jobs and scared away by our managers, at least at my location"
PetSmart,1dbi78t2p24f9000,1.0,"If you like your manager just sitting around smoking 2 packs of cigarettes per shift, and not backing you. The. Petsmart is the perfect job for you!!!"
PetSmart,1dbgtbgb324fp000,3.0,~Over worked and not enough help
PetSmart,1dbgj583b24eo000,3.0,"I learned a lot about animals, from how to take care of them to basic biology. I learned how to sell products and ensure customers of the facts they require. The employees were friendly and well mannered, and respectful."
PetSmart,1dbgfjf650mt7000,4.0,"I found the job to be enjoyable as an animal lover. The constant training and knowledge learned are enjoyable and useful in making sure that the animals cared for are in the best of hands. I found the manager and assistant managers to be very kind, interacting, engaging, and understanding. Co-workers are invested in all the animals with some specializing in certain animals. If you're willing to try, you can make friends with your co-workers easily. The job is often simple and you can never get tired caring for all the animals. The hardest part of the job is caring for the sick, the injured, or the returned animals in the isolation room. You will feel sad when you keep caretaking for an animal that just can't get healthy but you love that you can provide the loving and caring they appreciate. At times the job can get boring, slow, and repetitive but when rush hour hits, you'll be busy constantly. The best advice I can offer is taking the learnings to heart and try to advance your position. Advancing your position creates a more enjoyable and fulfilling experience overall that you won't forget."
PetSmart,1dbgbglq824eo000,5.0,"Employee benefits are above average, Great culture that tries to source foods from responsible companies. Supportive management, The only downside is the typical retail one - the store is only completely closed on Christmas Day and Thanksgiving Day."
PetSmart,1dbg8uo6624eo000,3.0,I give working here a 5 out of 10. There's alot of miscommunication. Low pay. The overall atmosphere asides is great. Working in a pet store if you love animals especially is a great time.
PetSmart,1dbg8roa524e9000,5.0,Must love animals to work for this company they are very goal driven. They are a customer satisfaction Environment. Go over and beyond with each customer and make sure you stick to policy and procedures and do everything safely and you will love it
PetSmart,1dbg0rv6m0kbo000,5.0,"My time at Petsmart was great, I loved the job and I loved my coworkers, I mostly quit because it was too far of a drive for how I was paid and I couldn't keep up with it. I loved working in Petcare, working with all the customers to help them choose the right pet for them, and also caring for all the animals. For the most part the atmosphere was pretty relaxed, even though the area itself made it kind of a quick paced job. My favorite part was definitely caring for the animals, and helping them find their forever homes. The hardest part of the job, was making sure they were going to good homes, and making sure the people were well educated to care for the animal. It was all still very enjoyable though."
PetSmart,1dbfuiena0kbo000,5.0,"Petsmart is an excellent place to work, specially if you are an animal lover.  The management team as well as the employees are amazing.  I absolutely recommend Petsmart."

PetSmart,1dbfpmvhr24e9000,2.0,"grooming is great pay and benefits offered to full time employees. Friendly work environment. The company likes to add pointless procedures and the occasional useless after hours ""paid"" meetings."
PetSmart,1dberaub75j5f800,5.0,I learned how to engage with customers and connect with their personal lives.
PetSmart,1dbejok4152tk800,1.0,Management is awful. No one follows rules. Promises were made to make me a groomer and it never happened. People were rude and unprofessional. Manager was rude and unprofessional. They do not care about the pets just the money. ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS MONEY. They paid me way less than what I am making now and I am doing the same exact thing
PetSmart,1dbe99j881d0300g,5.0,"it was a great first job, the clients were amazing and always brought us gifts and food during the summer time, which would be more traffic heavy. It's a home away from home."
PetSmart,1dbe0d27b24fj000,4.0,During the week it wouldn't be too busy but the weekends were very busy and stressful.
PetSmart,1dbc87gt124gi000,4.0,"I absolutely loved my job. Handing animals and teaching people about the care for them was a fantastic experience. Unfortunately I got driven off by poor management. Some of the lower end managers were great at what they did, but the store lead often wasn't there when we needed them. There were times when we had issues that required their attention but didn't answer any calls or texts. The store lead out sometimes have frustrated outbursts as well, scaring some employees. Overall, I enjoyed the job itself, but decided the environment of the store I specifically worked out was not the best."
PetSmart,1dbc1j1mu24fj000,4.0,"If you're applying to work in the grooming salon because you hate people and only want to work with dogs, then you're an actual fool. Please keep in mind that your entire day will be spent with your co-workers and in veiw of customers. the salon (including the back room where the kennels and baths are) is actually pretty small, and the one and ONLY window just lets you see the inside of the rest of the store. Customers will stare at you and children will tap on the glass like you're a god-forsaken fish. You will not see the light of day."
PetSmart,1dbbnadlb5j5f800,2.0,Worked hard and was promoted for effort.  Once was paid salary was required to work 60 hours a week or more since salary people don't cost more to overwork like their hourly people.  Overworked and underpaid.  Very corporate lifestyle.
PetSmart,1dbbeck8j24e3000,4.0,I worked at petsmart all through High school it was my real first job. I made so many life long friends who now 15 years later I still stay in contact with. I went back to work for Petsmart as part time seasonal help and was asked to stay on part time after the holidays I stayed for another year until I was offered full time employment elsewhere. Its an easy job for the most part if you love being around animals. Also if you have pets like myself the employee discount comes in handy.
PetSmart,1dbb00o3p24g2000,4.0,The company does well striving to follow its mission statement and what the company stands for. Customer focus is key and the priority that drives the business. Now with Chewy it is the largest pet supply retailer.
PetSmart,1dbavescr24fj000,4.0,"Petsmart will give you many tools to allow you to grow both within the company and outside of the company. They ensure that every individual is treated well, and that the pets are the main focus of daily operation."
PetSmart,1dbaj5pjj24gi000,4.0,I didn’t know if I would like retail or not having always had a desk job but I love customer service. I love coming in to work and seeing people bringing their dogs in or if they don’t have their dog with them I’ll always ask the customer what kind of dog they have if they’re buying dog food. We get into long conversations sometimes. Most customers are very pleasant. I like all of my coworkers and the management. The only things I don’t like are the low pay and sometimes only getting four hours a week.
PetSmart,1dba3djb61d03000,1.0,Bad management. Say they help with tuition but only a degree they appove of. No help taking care of groomers tools. All comes out of groomers pocket which costs a lot as is and with the cost of living its too much.
PetSmart,1db9qeka924f3000,4.0,"I absolutely loved working here, but my hours weren't as flexible as I would've liked. When I worked here, I was a senior in high school. My manager would always call me during school and ask if I could come in earlier. They were very much aware that I was in high school. My hours were also cut to working 1 day a week after I returned from time off with a very serious illness. I loved the animals and made friends with my coworkers, but the management could use some work."
PetSmart,1db90k6e624gi000,5.0,"I enjoyed my time at PetSmart as I love animals. The work is high paced and you do deal with some, let us say politely, interesting customers. You can tell who really wants to work there and who doesn't."
PetSmart,1db71k6d224f3001,1.0,Store manager talks more than she listens.
PetSmart,1db6s3tif5na3802,4.0,Petsmart is a great place to work entry level for animals lovers. Schedule is semi- flexible and management is knowledgeable. I worked at the PetHotel/ Doggie Day Camp Its more work then it appears. Team members are responsible for the health and well being of all pets in our care.
PetSmart,1db4g8m4924g2000,4.0,Volunteer work here. Cleaned cages and played with cats. Report any medical conditions the cats have. Food and water for the cats. General management of the place.
PetSmart,1db4cali424eh000,5.0,"Working at Petsmart has helped me learn a lot about pets and know how to take care of them. Also, you learn how to have good customer service. Just being able to play with different type of animals everyday is fun."
PetSmart,1db3ta4k91d0j000,3.0,Each store is very different however if you are hard working you can go far fast. Management is always growing their team to prepare them for the next step in their carriers.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1db3l8ihv24eh003,3.0,"Management wouldnt listen to what was going on behind closed doors. i was once threatened by an associate for following the proper feeding guides for the animals because i did not feed the fancy food that she had brought in to provide for said animals. I was uncomfortable and when brought to the manager i was told ""Well thats how she is"". so i went up one more level cause it was super unprofessional and she was dealt with. I left soon after as another associate tried to make it look like i had stolen a snake and tried to frame me for it, even though the night the snake went missing i was not working, he was."
PetSmart,1db1r7b7r1d03000,5.0,"Petsmart was a very fun job. I was able to be promoted multiple times and enjoyed each part of my job. It paid decently at the time, however I felt the work schedule was not fair. I would close at 9PM and have to be back at 4AM for the freight shift. I did enjoy the allowed overtime and being able to work in all areas of the store."
PetSmart,1db14p1k024gi000,3.0,"The store I worked at was in a great place full of great people so there was always business, and everything was new (the store was less than a year old) so everything was beautiful and shiny and worked great, which I can't say for every grooming salon I've worked at. The customers were nice to us but the staff wasn't always nice to each other...there was always some sort of drama going on, on any given day someone was upset with someone else. But everything remained mostly civil, it wasn't a bad work environment and the dogs in this area are very well-behaved, which makes it easier to groom them. We also had a Banfield Animal Hospital two doors down and a Doggie Day Camp/Hotel right next to us, so dogs could be groomed at leisure during their stay or get nice and tired by playing right before they get groomed to help them stay calm."
PetSmart,1davgskr2h3lm800,3.0,The place is a mess. Managers will sit around until necessary and will blame everyone else for problems in the store. Managers almost never go by policy and give the customers what they want. The pay is extremely low for Pet Care.
PetSmart,1dausu0ush41t800,4.0,"I wasn't actually employed by PetSmart, I actually volunteered, however, I would still recommend them if you like pets. I personally have a few pets, and have had a few in the past and I love animals so helping out with the cats made me happy and I enjoyed it."
PetSmart,1daumlce2h3hr802,5.0,"Pros: Great management, hard working co-workers, wonderful customers and their animals"
PetSmart,1dauk4gg0b8a2800,1.0,"I worked stock in the morning, a very hard job. you had a very limited to complete your work, sometimes you had to come in at 3AM. Working as a teem was the only good part of the job."
PetSmart,1dattv92jh3to800,4.0,Pay sucks till you get into management. If your not willing to give your life to this company dont expect to move up. No full time roles open unless your a manager.
PetSmart,1datt5v04h3pn800,3.0,It's a relaxed job does not pay well but it's more for kids or adults with no responsibilities or worries but coworkers are great and fun to be with as long as the job is done and in a fast pace your fine.
PetSmart,1dasdhrj1b8a2800,3.0,"I worked in the Salon. The culture was about animals, but there was a not-so-subtle undercurrent to push them through fast to get as many clients as possible. And perhaps I didn't have the proper mentality for the job, but my priority was first to build a relationship of trust with the animal before handling them or forcing them into the often unfamiliar position of grooming and bathing. This was never fast enough for management, yet I somehow was assigned the ""problem"" dogs. If I could manage an extra five minutes with them, I usually got them to allow me to clip nails or kennel them whereas others feared getting bitten. I understand that they make more money pushing through more customers and they always stressed safety of the animal and employee, but the main priority of sales seemed to work against what was stated."
PetSmart,1das400ish3pn800,3.0,"Nearly 3 years, and i was passionate and amazing at my job. I loved it. It only took the new store ""leader"" a few months and several several attempts to get me cut off."
PetSmart,1darrigbph3lm803,5.0,This place rocked!! Had the best time working there and I absolutely loved it and every customer that I came in contact with my clients were furry with wet noses!!
PetSmart,1darq2mh7b82c801,3.0,great fun place to work but no room to grow within the company. perfect for a part time job for a student that just needs extra money to get by for school.
PetSmart,1darjs4i8h3lm800,4.0,A typical work day depended on the day of the week. In pet care each day you had a different task that needed to be completed to make sure the animals are safe and taken care off.
PetSmart,1daq3db0ebre0800,4.0,it has great flexibility but not a lot of breathing room plus the management was horrible. I felt like I was working more than what i was getting paid for and it was really disorganized.
PetSmart,1dapnn5cuh45h800,2.0,"Morning shifts, had to feed and walk boarded dogs upon arrival and then doggy day camp where you make sure dogs safely interact and clean up when they go to the bathroom and keep a log of it. Night shifts, had to take dogs out of camp, feed them dinner, and then clean the entire facility. Management is friendly, but not trustworthy. No time to sit, constantly on your feet. The dogs are always great to interact with."
PetSmart,1daphmk5gh3tj800,4.0,I liked working to deal with dogs of all breeds and ages. The management on the other hand was horrible. The salon manager at Midland Texas is a horrible one. Welcomes drama and behaves very inappropriately with the employees there.
PetSmart,1dapgvr00b89s800,4.0,"Coworkers are nice, most customers are too. Managers help where they can but for Pet care your kinda on your own sometimes they ask to much of you and give little time to do it. The discounts are nice; wish we would get paid much more for all the things we do. Overall a pretty good place to work."
PetSmart,1dap3r7vsh45h800,4.0,"This was my first job and other than the fact that the store manager intimidated me I liked it. Of course I made a lot of mistakes since this was my first job but for the most part management was patient and understanding. The hours weren't good but I was just part time and hoped to become full time at some point. I would have stayed with this company but I was moving to Wisconsin with my family. I was told by my Texas manager that a transfer had been set up, but when I got to Wisconsin I was told by that store manager that there was no transfer and he had no openings for me."
PetSmart,1dap27va5h3lh800,1.0,Left job due to family emergency out of state.  I had to pack up and leave in one weekend.  I was never mailed my last check after repeated requests for them to do so.  I flew down to pick it up and by that time it had expired.  I was unable to cash it and they have refused to provide a new one.  I would never recommend anyone work at this establishment!  They steal from employees!!

PetSmart,1dap24m9dh3hm800,3.0,Managers are understand of how grooming can be overwhelming. Paid time off and benefits. After going to grooming academy you have to sign a contact so a secured job.
PetSmart,1daot7s5ph3pi805,3.0,"I worked in an entry level position in the grooming salon.  It is a lot of hard work, but there is opportunity to become a groomer in a very short amount of time, if you would like."
PetSmart,1daorrff35n9n800,5.0,"You get to work with animals all day, the people here are always upbeat and ready to work. We have times where we have to be serious but we also have many more times where we can joke around and have a blast."
PetSmart,1danoqsq1bre0802,2.0,I worked for Petsmart as a groomer for a little over a year with mixed opinions by the end of my time there (also based on this particular salon).
PetSmart,1danl9be85n9n800,3.0,"PetSmart has allowed me to grow in the grooming industry by offering on-the-job training with grooming academy. However, I feel as if the company is asking too much of the salon associates making it hard for employees to be fully committed to the pets in their care. Having full-time benefits is a perk along with the ability to rise more in the company."
PetSmart,1dan647h2b89s801,1.0,Very low pay for hourly associates.  The low pay for associates resulted in a lot of turnover.  Salaried managers work 60-70 hour weeks.  “Pet care” is a joke.  AVOID THIS COMPANY!  I accepted this job because I loved animals and enjoyed being a manager in retail.  I left for reasons too numerous to list.
PetSmart,1damscsqth3hm800,3.0,A typical day at work at my location depends really on the attitude of the manager on duty that day and how much direction they want to relay. The benefits aren't really better or worse than any other retail job. If you like pets that's a positive of working here.
PetSmart,1damkcp7l5j54800,4.0,"Pretty good place to work. Fair hours, reasonable pay, nothing out of the ordinary for a first part-time job. Only word of caution would be that if you sign up for any position outside of grooming/management, you will be doing any and every job needed to be done in your shift. You may sign up as a pet care associate, but you will spend plenty of time stocking and cashiering as well as being an associate."
PetSmart,1dalf77csbre0800,5.0,PetSmart is a great job to have whether it’s part time or full time! You get to help care for the animals in store and the ones Pet Parents own by knowing information to help all Pet Parents!
PetSmart,1dakvlah55ndm800,4.0,"a very hard company to grow in and with, always hires outside of the comany and I found the lack of communication frustrating. but, an excellent starter job, good pay, respectful of time off requests and overall a fun and fullfilling job."
PetSmart,1daku5gu7bre0800,3.0,"PetSmart will work around your school schedule so long as you can still make it to your positions starting time.  For my position, all early morning stock team leads had to show up at 4 am generally speaking.  You'd then stage the truck by putting the items from the truck close the their respective departments and begin working them.  Once the truck was finished, you'd generally be opening cashier until you were relieved.  The issue with this company is that the many tiers of middle management you have to deal with for a simple stocking/cashier job. If you made one mistake (or had to watch a training video) you'd hear from multiple managers throughout the day reminding you of such.  Generally speaking, the harder you work the less you get paid here.   Finishing your work early yields nothing in the way of financial or any promotional incentive.  They push customer service and selling puppy kits or other deals more so than anything else.  Great short term job but don't get comfortable; its not good for you health."
PetSmart,1daka4mc0h3hm800,5.0,"If you love pets and are just getting into the work force, this is the ideal place to work. You will get loads of experience in customer service and retail, and you will get to meet people's pets and make new friends!"
PetSmart,1dajoi7keb862800,2.0,I would not recommend working at petsmart on Pinole. There was never any workers. Management never did there job and it was way to stressful for such a low hourly pay rate
PetSmart,1daif0jhsb825801,2.0,"Im an Early Morning Stocker and have worked at PetSmart for 2 Years. My start time would usually be at 4am and my teammates would be set at 5am and 6am respectively. Usually you'll be working with 2 people. The manager who comes in to check inventory and your Teammate. The manager needs to open the store so they come in at the same time as you. If you go In at the same time as your manager you'll first have to clock in than check if any price tags for the morning need to go out. you will than proceed to sweep the store, restrooms, than mop the important parts of the store while fixing anything that looks out of place or disorganized. You might have to replace the soap, toilet seat covers and toilet paper if the bathrooms don't have any. Than if everything goes smoothly and if the truck is on time your manager will offload the truck and get the pallets ready for you to pick up and take them on the sales floor to work.  Load days are Tues, Thurs, and sun. Thursdays are the biggest load so most likely you'll have an extra person coming in to help at 6AM. Now that the loads being moved out It should be 5am and your teammate just clocked in and is helping you stock. You work from 5am to 6am doing load than take your break. since the stores censors turn on around 7am you'll want to be inside the store before depending on what time your break is. 6am, 7am, 8am. around 7am your last hour you will be putting out inventory. It sounds easy and its supposed to be, but managers want you to do everything at half time or less and everything has to be perfect."
PetSmart,1daibapcpb862800,5.0,"I have loved working at petsmart, they have taught me many things and have given me many skills to take with me wherever i go. Great place with great people."
PetSmart,1dahj9lsth41o800,4.0,"I would spend the better part of the day taking care of the hygienic qualities of the hotel-regulations are very strict and require a great attention to detail. There were days were I could spend up to five hours in ""camp"" with the dogs, which required constant vigilance.The most difficult part of the job was the stress of an animal coming into critical condition of a fight. The coworkers were a privileged to work with and the management with beyond caring and supportive."
PetSmart,1dah4f43hh3tj800,5.0,"Great place to work, management is wonderful as well. I learned alot there from working as a team to working in a salon environment. I would recommend any one to work there"
PetSmart,1daerfsjp52t3800,3.0,I loved working with the dogs and the people but sadly you're underpaid if you work there and the raises are a joke. you break your back for the company and you end up not getting a 7 cent raise because you called out once the whole year.

PetSmart,1dacl5fj65nd5800,5.0,"I have nothing but good things to say about Petsmart. It's a great place of employment. Don't just think it's about playing with animals all day, you get paid to work, not play."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1da9tin1gh3t4800,3.0,I had a bad experience with a bad manager. Management should be interpersonal and be able to relate to employees. Not tell them how bad they’re doing every day.
PetSmart,1da9f99gfh3t4800,1.0,They do not care about their employees.To them their employes are just a number. No matter how long u have worked their they will fire u as quickly and for the stupidest reasons and they would to an employye who hasnt reached their 90 days.
PetSmart,1da9egq31h3p4800,5.0,"Great work environment, however it can be stressful due to there being so many people without adequate spacing in the salon.  Management really cares about their employees and customers!"
PetSmart,1da7mf019h3t4800,3.0,I'm not sure about other petsmarts but my particular store jad very poor management and communication. The open door policy was a joke the manager are not accommodating or caring of their employees. The only way to get treated remotely fairly or to be able to move up is to stay out of the way even if it means breaking rules and being out of regulation.
PetSmart,1da2bs26m5j4j800,5.0,A wonderful place to start your career with pets. Options for advancement and flexible shifts. Allow you to work in multiple positions until you find the department which fits you best.
PetSmart,1d9vua8fhb85g800,2.0,Working there was okay at the start but when new managers came in they started to play favorites with the staff. It got so bad that some of the employees would spend hours of the day on their phones not working while others had to pick up the extra work.Never had a job where management promoted the worst employees before.
PetSmart,1d9tdj939b89b800,2.0,"What kind of diet do they have to be such heartless people? Also, every time, the quality is so messed up. There is really nothing to offer here. Why the heck would anyone think this is a good idea to work here?"
PetSmart,1d9t697hvh453800,5.0,"Buen clima laboral, buena empresa, buenas prestaciones, buenas instalaciones, pet friendly por supuesto."
PetSmart,1d9strhtfh3p4802,3.0,"I worked at the PetHotel part for 3 years. When I first started I was promoted to Senior in 6 months. The difference between my starting position as a Pet Care Specialist (daycamp Associate) and Senior Pet Care Specialist is a set of keys to access the medicine cabinet, numbers to log onto the register,  and dealing with customers more. I needed another job to help with bills and unfortunately, you can't be a Senior AND have another job because it messes up your availability. So I stepped down to be a daycamp associate again. Anyway, unless you want to work in the store, there really is no room for advancement. But it was nice seeing all the pets."
PetSmart,1d9rhmoa35nd5800,2.0,"Great place to work with animals. Work environment is usually laid back, and other staff is friendly and easy to work with depending on who you're working with. Always something to do."
PetSmart,1d9rcajtph453800,1.0,managers are scum  who do not care about the animals. half the associates all have intimacy   in the back and the dog trainer is a pedo LOL wouldn’t suggest working here unless you like rude managers and a hostile environment
PetSmart,1d9qd1f4jh3l3800,1.0,I worked for this company for 10 years. The first seven were great. Once it went private the leadership and culture deteriorated to the point where it became a horrible place to work and I dreaded every day.
PetSmart,1d9q25kk5h3l3800,2.0,"Maybe it's just the location (Logan, UT), but nothing gets cleaned properly, animals get sick all the time from poor care, and it's always the associates' fault (according to the managers anyway).  In the end, I hated the job and just couldn't handle the sick and dying animals anymore."
PetSmart,1d9o1dmeo5n95804,3.0,They Cant keep.managers . you have to beg for time off. If you get pregnant you are treated unfairly the only way to get proper hoirs is to train in several positions and you almost never get a raise. Except that required by law
PetSmart,1d9nhu7vrh41a800,2.0,I worked for this company for over 10 years in upper store management and was recently dismissed for a hear say investigation that had no hard evidential proof of me having any wrong doing. Very disappointing way to end a long career.
PetSmart,1d9labtknh3l3800,1.0,The previous store I worked in was ok there was structure and a solid crew of people working there . I was asked if I was interested in a position in another so I took thinking it would be an opportunity for advancement boy was I wrong . The manager was clueless . I started with Petsmart in 2007 and never thought it could get as bad as this store was one feared with mice and rats . Most of all idiotic management !
PetSmart,1d9ktujaah3p4800,1.0,"I was told I would become a fulltimer after a month or two and was still receiving around 15 hours a week, while favored employees received more. It's full of cliques."
PetSmart,1d9knbbqfh3h8800,3.0,management was terrible the bonuses were great but the supervisors never did things they were supposed to do and if they did it was way late for the most part of the job you never saw them anyway
PetSmart,1d9ir6mnbbrdf800,2.0,"The job itself is a good job. It’s fun and rewarding. It can be stressful at times. The management and lack of training makes he job tedious. As an employee of nearly three years, I have to do much more than I’m paid for."
PetSmart,1d9ii16bmh3h8801,4.0,We are trained to accomplish a certain amount of things done within our shift and during that time we are to also help customers. We are to know very much detail regarding our products in order to help the customer in the best way possible.

PetSmart,1d9a98unsb81j800,2.0,-This would be a great job if it wasn't for the poor management.
PetSmart,1d97v6stib81e800,5.0,"Getting to work at petsmart is fulfilling because you are able to help pet parents make educated decisions on supplies and care for their pets, you also get to meet some strange people and some really cool pets."
PetSmart,1d96vcmqo5n8m800,1.0,Don't ever work here. They do not give workers enough hours. Management is mean and nasty. The is a lot of favoritism. Worst job ever! Never work here.
PetSmart,1d96lpfmkh40q800,4.0,"I started this job in college and it was a perfect job until I ended up having to move. It was very flexable with my school hours, but they would also make sure I had enough hours of work that I asked for."
PetSmart,1d96kanieb85a800,3.0,"Great place to interact with pets. Working well with others, builds strong relationship with employees and customers. Great opportunity to learn and grow."

PetSmart,1d95qopg80kbn000,1.0,If you are a dog groomer and are looking for somewhere to work then please don’t work here. I love my job but this place is insane. The managers only care about the money and never about their groomers.
PetSmart,1d95e5f11h3sk800,5.0,"Extremely busy and at times very stressful. Enjoyed unloading trucks and maintaining the mix center. It was quite involved, unloading freight, documentation of the loads for discrepancies, taking photos of damaged loads, filing reports to corporate regarding problem loads. Data entry of invoices, inventory of product in mix center lanes (cross dock staging) twice daily, maintaining a clean work area and getting product to the stores in a timely manner and correctly."
PetSmart,1d956lrj0h40q800,4.0,"I do enjoy working at Petsmart. It's a good company to work for, everyone is very friendly and I enjoy the work I do. They are just not offering full time employment and I need full time employment."
PetSmart,1d944k0hr1bad000,3.0,"Pet Smart is a great place to work at, you just have to have a lot of patience, especially with the pet parents. Customer Service is extremely important to your manager(s). Working here can be overwhelming especially when you may be the only one on the register and there's a whole line backing up. Otherwise, it's fun."
PetSmart,1d940pavth3kk800,3.0,"I worked there for a good few months before I got told I needed surgery. I told my manager this and went off to get my surgery. I wasn't given time off, I didn't receive workers comp. They terminated me for not being able to work after surgery."
PetSmart,1d93sd69dh3gm800,3.0,Little to no support from management staff. Management has difficulty keeping employees information confidential with other employees and management staff. Huge turnover rate with employees and managers. More like a high school than a retail corporation
PetSmart,1d93irj2hb896800,1.0,Not the best how ever the grass isnt always greener on the other side. Managers are bad and expect to much. You can make good friendships though if thats what youre looking for
PetSmart,1d93g55nrh3gm800,5.0,"if you love animals this is the place to work. As a sales job, you will need to have some level of competition, but all my coworkers were always fun to be around. The hours were very flexible with my school schedule, which was probably the hardest part of the day, and I could get more hours by doing stocking in the early hours which was very beneficial. Plus you get to see puppies every day!!"
PetSmart,1d937sg3lbrda800,5.0,Petsmart is a company that changes direction  often. They keep you on your toes. But I believe that is simply one of the expectations in retail? Retail is a tough business and developing applications while trying to run the business is tough.
PetSmart,1d937drfv0kbn000,4.0,I love this job but was not given enough hours. I need more hours and they were not able to give the hours. they had lots of employees so hours were limited.
PetSmart,1d92rk4p4h3ok800,2.0,"I’m sure the company as a whole is better than the store I worked at, though the constant questions revolving around the grooming salons safety was stressful. A close friend of mine is still a groomer there and I recommend her, but not the store. The manager I had was awful. Verbally abusive and offensive to team members and customers at times. She was the worst problem there."
PetSmart,1d92kk411h3gm800,4.0,As a store leader I gave it my all because I was supported by district leader and did not want to let him down.   Built a solid team.   As I find with all retail I find drama.   Enjoyed working with adoption groups and pet parents pets.
PetSmart,1d91dt9qeb890800,4.0,Petsmart gave me the opportunity to expand my career by not only managing people but now pets.  It was a great job and there are times I regret leaving due to relocation.

PetSmart,1d90t9ljih40h800,4.0,"In a typical day at petsmart I come into work ready to work and have a great day. The relationship that I have with my coworkers is amazing and working with the pets is really rewarding most days. All of my managers are amazing, from the store manager to the the salon manager. After the end of the day I have the possibility of going home or netting a few extra hours on the floor because I have been cross-trained to run the cash register and help out on the floor. The times that I find the most difficult is when the salon is really busy and everyone is very busy but we get though it and manage to complete everything. Working at petsmart is a great experience and I am happy to be an associate."
PetSmart,1d90n36lf0kbh000,1.0,"The main problem with petsmart is that the live animals they get come from irresponsible breeders, these pets are obviously kept in ill conditions since we get shipments of sick animals all of the time. Corporate is aware and yet does not change the suppliers. All they care about is sales. They do not care about managers or the concerns , if any problems occur they can just find a reason to fire or move the person to another store location."
PetSmart,1d90e409l1aha000,5.0,"Managenent works with you on scheduling.  Spending time in daycamp with up to 17 dogs at once can be very rewarding.  It is also sometimes trying since a particular dog or two may not be playing appropriately.  The team at the desk is there to support you, help you, and take a dog out for timeout as needed.  They also provide wifi speakers so you can play your own music which is really nice."
PetSmart,1d8vqa9131ahp000,5.0,Great place to work. Good pay. Full time benifits are good. Skme days are high pace others arent. Managment is always there to help along with other team members. The team work is out standing. I have had the opportunity to learn a lot frkm the store an to being able to mo vcd e around the store is great for me. My regurlars are amazing. I know them by name an they know me by name. Over all this is my favoreite job an i plan on being with them for a while
PetSmart,1d8v52fia24gv000,3.0,"There was way too much work given then there was time to complete it. If you weren’t literally running, you weren't fast enough. Each of our pallets were supposed to take about an hour to work. How do you get 12 pallets done in an 8 hour shift, don’t ask me. The corporate it’s self gives management tasks to do but there isn’t enough time to do it. On top of it the plan-o-grams were always wrong every time. I loved the animals but, they just was just way too stressful."
PetSmart,1d8v3t3g624fu000,3.0,"I would  like to work there full time with more pay and insurance. If there were more opportunities for advancement, I would like to pursue a management career, as I do enjoy working with the animals."
PetSmart,1d8v3252ab812800,4.0,"Put both the customer or pet parents as well as the pets in jeopardy and lack of regard for the employees as well. I believe this was due to poor management, such as crowding the facility over the legal capacity making it an unsafe environment."
PetSmart,1d8um11a21ago000,1.0,I loved it but they said I wasn't fast enough. I worked in the groomer section. My boss wasn't very nice at all too me. I was really trying my best. Did real good bathing them and drying them..
PetSmart,1d8ujsune24ff000,2.0,"I won’t even say it’s management it’s the company all together. If you go to other Petsmart’s it’s like that too. Now don’t get me wrong i love animals i love being around them the problem is the pay and the other employees. The managers don’t want to fire the ones who never show or do what they want yet the ones who do go out of their way to stay later, work harder, and work someone else’s shift on their off day gets no recognition. They don’t want to give FT hours nor pay you more. It’s like you’re forced to quit or find another job. I’ve talked to ones above me about training to be a stylist but i don’t even think i want to work for the company any more. It’s sad because i love and adore animals"
PetSmart,1d8uii9g524gv000,1.0,I've worked at 2 stores and got the same treatment at both. I met my current boyfriend at the last store I was at and I ended up pregnant and all of a sudden they started getting abusive and degraded us. They threatened us the whole time and when I told the manager I wanted to quit she told me I wasnt allowed. I walked out. They never helped me with anything. I'm not trying a 3rd petsmart.
PetSmart,1d8u958t4b812800,2.0,"They only care about numbers. Doesn't matter if you have 120+ dogs in the hotel, they still wont let you hire more employees. With the turnover rate of employment really high, them hiring young ""first job"" individuals who call out, they still expect you to take care of all the animals with the advertised care. Every holiday i worked (employed for 4 years), it was me and 1-2 other employees trying care for 120+ dogs, PLUS maximum amount of doggy day care dogs/customers and management saying not to turn away even if we run out of room. so not only are we over crowding, but every dog isn't getting the proper care and attention that the customer paid for. I only stayed as long as I did because of school, and because I tried to create change for the hotel and kept hoping upper management would help and change themselves but corporate wont let it."
PetSmart,1d8tvb43024ff000,4.0,This job is perfect for a student working part time as the hours are really flexible and your managers are understanding of a healthy school/work life. Also extremely low stress and easy. Honestly retail is a hard job to work but working with the pets and their owners is a major perk to this job. Literally the easiest retail job you can work. Only down side is rude customers. Which is in every job you'll ever work.
PetSmart,1d8tvafp224gv000,3.0,"Becoming a trainer requires additional study and time, as well as patience with animals and people. For those interested in pursuing a career as a trainer, this may be a good place to start."
PetSmart,1d8t5qj2d0kbh000,3.0,"This job is nothing more or less than the bane of retail. You deal with the same retail villains from years past. They Who Arrive Before Opening and Those That Come 5 Minutes To Go. The management doesn't know how to talk to people, often addressing you as if you are not a free person. And the work will be more demanding than the compensation is worth. But it's a job. So if you need it take it."
PetSmart,1d8si2h1824ef000,4.0,Required management to work 50 hours and gave a lot of responsibility to each manager but not a lot of staffing or support. Fast paced environment and high demands to produce and get stuff done.
PetSmart,1d8s1l6d0h40h800,4.0,"groom up to 6 dogs a day. i bathe then give them there hair cut, as well as answer the phone, making appointments, and checking in/out the dogs. sometime it can be stressful but its manageable"
PetSmart,1d8rq83vl0kbh000,1.0,"I worked in the salon as a dog bather and was on my way to be sent to schooling to become a groomer. The salon manager was never in the salon. I was trained by other groomers and not managers. I would constantly get over booked and would have to rush through customers pets and not do the best I could. Petsmart never turned away pets even after they showed signs of aggression or even after bitting a groomer. I had a pitt bull lunge at me when trying to put it in the cage. Had both a full grown husky and german Sheppard lunge at me and almost bit me while washing and drying. Their biggest mistake is the glass windows up front. Pet parents sit up there waving at their pets making it impossible to complete the groom. My last dog was a chihuahua. It was perfectly calm in the back with its bath and dry but as soon as we came up front to do its nails it flilped out after seeing its mom. It bit me 3 times before another girl came to hold it for me. Even with her holding it it still managed to bite me, but this time wouldn't let go of my hand. So I swatted at it to get it off my hand. Even though the pet parent apologized for its pets behavior I was still fired. Was a blessing in disguise. Too stressful for the pay."
PetSmart,1d8rjmpag24gv000,5.0,i worked early morning stock usually from 12 to 8 and i liked getting home in morning. but if i ever was tired then i would sleep a good part of my day away. overall fun easy job just as long as you can lift around 25 lbs
PetSmart,1d8rh7jpnb890800,3.0,"Fun place to work.  I really enjoyed working in this store learning all that I did. My only complaint is the Management is very poor. If you are not in the cool kids circle you won’t be promoted. I spent 5 years there doing my very best keeping all customers happy, and doing the managers job. Yet I couldn’t get promoted to a simple managers position. Instead they gave it to the new people who were younger and had no experience at all."
PetSmart,1d8r8flc224ef000,1.0,I was a manager on duties and was held at gun point in the store. I was asked to step down because they thought I would not be able to handle the store after. I walked away after the insult. I was also asked to come back to work right away and nit take any days off. I was also blamed for the robbery. A court date fixed that.

PetSmart,1d8r7uagabrd2800,3.0,"LOVED going to work for the animals I bonded with, unfortunately it was hard to make the store better for them. Cleanliness and safety tends to get put on the back burner due to fast work pace and lack of staff on any given shift."

PetSmart,1d8qa54gebrd2800,5.0,Must be competitive. Fast-paced environment. Customer service is the heart of the company. The customers satisfaction is what makes the company thrive.
PetSmart,1d8pp2sbvb890800,3.0,Everything was unfair. They allowed bullying. They wouldn't help. The older employees were rude and did not follow rules and regulations. Management favored workers who were there longer.
PetSmart,1d8pi97imb853800,5.0,PetSmart is a fun environment to work in because you get to interact with many animals daily. The culture and vibe at PetSmart is also a huge roll in the fun factors of working here.
PetSmart,1d8p024hn24ef000,4.0,"Loved working at petsmart great environment. Fast paced easy to learn, very hands on with the animals. Loved working with peoples pets. Cons though we cater to customers to much they expect to just get what they want and we let them, it's a bit infuriating to deal with so many entitled people. Other than that love it."
PetSmart,1d8o19fem24ef000,4.0,I didn’t like the park of cleaning up all the animals cages alone when there other people capable of helping or doing it when it wasn’t my role at the workplace. I would have to guess on things because I wouldn’t have a lot of help there.
PetSmart,1d8n8j22lb890800,1.0,Poor management . They do not care for their employees. Training in the pet hotel is done by other employees. Harassment by senior leaders in a negative way. Never positive.   Have worked in several places as a kennel attendant and have never been in a poorly run place as this. Many injurys to employees with no regard to them. They always promote do the right thing ! What a crock! Had four injuries and never was asked once how I was doing. To many dogs in a small area and dog fights constantly. That's what happens when you put to many dogs in a small area for lengths of time. Also dogs that should not be put on cement floors and have to be there all day.  Employees also and can't sit down but we have a choice we can leave.
PetSmart,1d8mnrf7bb812800,3.0,"Most days were fine, and plenty of furry customers to spoil. But other times there was a lack of communication and support. It is also hard to accept the idea of disposable pets. That it is better to have an animal sold to a bad situation, than to not sell it. Also they had a employee of the month board, but often didn't bother to use it. Same with their birthday board. It was often times not updated or they just failed to include everyone."
PetSmart,1d8m4sgt824fu000,3.0,Typical retail. Had fun with customers and their pets. Had many nice co workers. Learned a lot about many different pet products and food. Wished they were better with the promise of full time and advancements.
PetSmart,1d8lvfb91b853800,2.0,"Great place to work and love it, they have a lot of employees and don't give anyone very many hours.  The most hours I have had is 28, and some weeks I get 8 hours.  This is why I am looking for a different job."
PetSmart,1d8lp2lrm5nci800,4.0,My first job right out of high school. Was an awesome place to work. You learn so much and you have the right people to help you. A little overpriced but great products for your pet.
PetSmart,1d8khpafob88u800,1.0,There were daily conference calls with the market. If the store didn't make training sales the manager who might not have worked the day before was called out and basically embarrassed in front of the other management over the phone. The workplace culture was not as it seemed and not friendly! If they wanted to address an issue with managers they should learn to provide information or concerns on an individual basis. Not by embarrassing employees over phone. Not an inclusive environment!
PetSmart,1d8hsmv5n24gt000,4.0,"awesome co workers, decent hours. flexible hours, working with dogs is a plus! Have to love animals and not be allergic. Builds your character. Fast paced environment"

I haven't learned anything new at Petsmart in regards to my role that wasn't carried over from my previous employments. The hardest part of the job is lifting fish tanks that weigh over two hundred pounds. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with dogs and cats as well as other various animals.
PetSmart,1d8ei751qbrco800,3.0,I would like to see more professionalism in the grooming salons. All salons are different but most are too lax and social over the complete focus on the pet in their care.
PetSmart,1d8ef94f9b80m800,3.0,"Even though my job was to keep the cat adoption area clean, I'd have customers come through the doors multiple times an hour asking if I could leave the cats out and let them play with them.

PetSmart,1d82r8esk24f5000,2.0,"I use to actually like working here. I was treated fairly and not just a number. Now, corporate expects way to much out of us groomers. Take 5 plus dogs, pushing sales, managers ""shrinking"" appointments taking you to a whole level of stress as you're trying to get done 8 dogs on a shift. Just so they can get their bonus pay check at the end of the year. They force you to use benefits sick pay and vacation at the beginning of the year and they refuse to fix broken items because its ""not in their budget"" okay multi million dollar company... We work holidays for pennies because we are commission base and only get one sale on holidays. Corporate also takes off Christmas eve while we have to work. Shows we are ""the little people"". Prepare to work Fri-Sun, and working 6 day streaks opening and closing shifts.HOWEVER. They do have your back if something were to happen, if a customer doesnt like a groom, they wont yell at you but critique kindly to see if you had a bad day, so that nice!"
PetSmart,1d81teeo91ahc000,2.0,I adore pets and am always eager to educate pet parents to better care for their animals. Petsmart was more focused on pushing product out the door than educating customers. Cashiers are largely ignored and management would rather give you a nasty comment when you asked for help or backup.
PetSmart,1d81leuib0mt6000,4.0,"Overall I enjoyed my 10 years with PetSmart. My last three years there are when everything slowly declined. I am a strong believer in enjoying your work. Unfortunately, my Store Manager for the last three years was a cheater, manipulator and user. Despite my best attempts to get transferred peacefully, I was trapped. Prior to that my managers were great. However, all managers that I worked for were typically stressed and usually felt intimidated by upper management (District Managers). But I'm sure that's just about everywhere. The benefits were decent and vacation time grew with length of employment. Ever growing policy manual."
PetSmart,1d81h3s4j1ba9000,4.0,"Honestly it’s a good paying job if you know what your doing, it’s based off of 50% commission. No hourly unless you don’t make commission, but you would have to push sales yourself. I always made more then 700$ A week. So yes it’s a great job but it is quick, sometimes stressful and you have to be good with time management."
PetSmart,1d81bon7g24g5000,4.0,A typical day would be cleaning the cage the animals stayed in and watching them in the play room or cleaning the play room. I learned how great it is to have an animal and how to handle one. The hardest part was making sure the animals got along. The enjoyable was when the boxers would sit near me instead of playing with others. They were sweet.
PetSmart,1d810o3l552ta800,1.0,"I worked at PetSmart twice in my life, and both times it was the worst job I ever had. The management is always a terrible joke. Not only did one manager nit pick and complain about everything I did, and would tell me to do things I was already doing, but another one came at me for my private FB postings. PRIVATE. And didn't mention where I worked or any names. So why come at me about it? That's 2 bad managers. The third, is a little petulant child who yelled at me in front of customers because they didn't give me the proper training I needed and didn't know something. It was very real, and she was made to apologize, which she did with a sneer and walked out to smoke. They were understaffed but instead of hiring new people they had me working in 2 different departments simultaneously. I have an anxiety disorder and after a panic attack, they never checked on me, just sent my paychecks in the mail. The first time I worked there, I was being paid $1 less than my male coworkers and a female coworker put a death threat in my locker which management did nothing about. Can I mention anymore about how many bad managers they have??? There's a ""sick"" room in the back where neglected sick animals die. Wish I took pictures. Don't apply here, they also never worked with me and my hours as I have a lot of DR appts. Seemed like I could never tell them in time even if it was 2 weeks away. Just gave me attitude every time. The managers are like a clique of HS girls bullying others. Grow up. Not a nice place to work at all. And I did my BEST. I have a 2 year old to support, I tried my hardest"
PetSmart,1d807fhaab80i800,3.0,"It’s not a hard job to do and can be nice to work with a lot of animals. It’s fast-paced on busy days and can get stressful, but the slower, more relaxed days help balance. The people you work with can truly make it or break it. Those pretty much become your support system in the work field. The manager is what forces all of you to cooperate, since all they did was sit inside the office. The assistant manager was no help to that at all. They definitely play favorites and you can tell pretty easily. If you’re trained extremely slowly, then congrats you’re at the bottom of the pyramid. You want promises of promotion dangled over your head like a dog? Then it’s the job for you. The company itself barely cares too. It’s all about image."
PetSmart,1d8071b0lb80i804,3.0,The company expects too much from associates. They give very little hours per week to get task done but expect it to still be done. Most of the time there is 2 associates and 1 manager working.
PetSmart,1d801tuq21ba9000,1.0,"If you are looking for a place that has condescending managers who do not care about you or the animals they sell you have the right place. Management will write you up for calling out/going home sick because it affects your attendance. You tend to get days off that are requested, but other than that they don't care. They will sell anything to any customer if they really want it regardless of how they'll take care of it, even though per policy we are not supposed to. We are supposed to walk customers through everything they are supposed to need for an animal and make sure they actually get it and that they are getting these animals as pets not food or to set them free. However, if they want it we are required to sell it. For example, if a customer wants a mouse to feed to a snake we have to sell it even if they tell us what its for and do not want the frozen we offer. Management will ignore you and when you ask them questions they talk down to you and act as if you are too stupid to do the job you were hired to do. They will not give you a full time position unless you kiss their butts, so most full time positions are given to those who do not deserve it. They will make you stay over without asking because they expect it of you. They do not help even when you are swamped by yourself, but still expect everything to be done on time. When tasks are not completed in a timely fashion under these circumstances they verbally reprimand you.  I will say that I do LOVE my coworkers, they are great and make work somewhat bearable, but would not recommend working here."
PetSmart,1d7vnfupe24g5000,5.0,Love the animals and the quiet time in the morning stocking and then seen chill animals that made it have a lifting feeling in the environment  when you worked.
PetSmart,1d7shsi080mti000,4.0,"Petsmart was a great place to work.  always had something to do when I came in. There were never really any slow days. It was always go go go, which was nice. I learn many skills through there monthly training program. The pay was decent, and I learned a great deal about pets and products."
PetSmart,1d7s1av8i1d0d000,3.0,"I think Petsmart is a good foundation for people who want to groom. They'll pay you while they teach you, they set you up with tools and you get a ""Notes From The Grooming Table"" book. I just advise to get all the learning under your belt then travel elsewhere. Petsmart really sees it's groomers as robots. The salons are run to be competitive. And if any type of incident happens, they won't stop to think on how to improve things. They'll just put all the blame on you then ditch you in the end."
PetSmart,1d7qm131052t6800,1.0,Worked at the Bowling Green location and it was a joke to say the least. Nothing but college kids working and no structure. And the management was pathetic.
PetSmart,1d7qln9ge1d1c000,4.0,"Petsmart was a great place to work, there were multiple shifts and hours of availability. The pay was decent, and I learned  a greeat deal about pets and products."

PetSmart,1d7qjkjsj1bg9000,3.0,"The pay and benefits at petsmart were great, but the job was very demanding and high maintenance and very 'uptight.' Demands as a manager were highly stressful and it was hard to feel as if you were doing a job well done. It would have been better if more staff were working at a time and all of the duties didn't fall on one person."
PetSmart,1d7pvao9q1d0d000,4.0,"Working with animals is great, especially if you work in the PetCare department. But sometimes it feels like your pay should be more because we are the most knowledgeable of variety of animals and their care."
PetSmart,1d7pjv3030mt2000,4.0,"Depending on the location and management, Petsmart can be a great place to work. You get to meet a lot of friendly pet parents and take care of the pups that come into the salon. you must have a lot of patients and work well with all sorts of animals."
PetSmart,1d7p40gc51d0v000,1.0,"They insult you on a constant basis, and when you make it know or go to management, they wont care, instead they write you up. They turn a blind eye to all the negativity done there. DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ITS EMPLOYEES!!"
PetSmart,1d7ollp8o1aho000,3.0,"Basic warehouse job, lots of physical activity and lifting. Good discounts but management sucks and every day was the same. Couldn't stay there long.."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1d7o0068o1d0d000,1.0,"The management is nice, in the very beginning. After awhile they were rude and extremely unprofessional"
PetSmart,1d7n3fiqa1aho000,2.0,not enough help in store to do all thats required by any manager
PetSmart,1d7loh7ng5j55800,3.0,Good part time job while in school. They would cut hours quite often to where it basically was barely any money. Day camp breaks for associates became fewer and fewer. Discounts were good. The regular
PetSmart,1d7lksqrt1ah9000,1.0,"My experience was a joke. My “training” of which most was not completed, consisted of sitting in a room by myself watching outdated videos. My store manager never took the time to properly train me and a year in she fired me for lack of productivity."
PetSmart,1d7lcj94d0mt2000,4.0,"Most of management is very kind, as well as the co workers. Many employees work here for years without advancement in title or pay, unfortunately. It’s a nice job for someone that needs flexible hours."
PetSmart,1d7lbbsu252t6800,3.0,If you are a pet lover then PetSmart is the best place for you to work at . You get to meet many people and pet owner who love they're pets you will get learn what is the best pet food to feed your pet
PetSmart,1d7l5ml3m1d1c000,4.0,PetSmart was a very faced environment. We were offered the opportunity to study course material fitting for the job and given a small pay raise after completing a series of tests associated with the study material. I learned a great deal. Within the first month I was able to confidently help customers I many different departments.
PetSmart,1d7k50rq71bg9000,3.0,A competitive work environment that changed daily. The focus is on the customer and ensuring the best experience possible for each customer. Each day brought different priorities based on the needs of the business.
PetSmart,1d7k1b1o124e2000,4.0,"I worked here while I was in school, and the hours were fair to maneuver around. At my store, there was usually only an opening bather and a closer, rarely a mid-shift worker."
PetSmart,1d7jtv8cd5j55800,4.0,I love working with animal's so it made me happy to know I was doing something positive for them.
PetSmart,1d7issm3n24eb000,3.0,"Having worked for petsmart for 4 years I have had my ups and downs. Recently there has been nothing but downs. Management in some stores, is absolutely horrible. If you aren't on the store leaders good side she will do whatever she can to get you fired. From having other managers spy on your every move to spreading rumors about you. She will do what ever possible to make you unhappy until you either mess up and get fired or quit."
PetSmart,1d7ispr5v24fr000,1.0,Management only cares about sales and not the health of animals. They swept animal deaths under the rug and  the cages are not big enough for any of the animals!
PetSmart,1d7ipbi261ai5000,3.0,"Despite the support of coworkers, upper level management holds our department with little regard.  Combine this with increased burnout and increased demands on the limited time to complete tasks, Petsmart may not be a top company to work for."
PetSmart,1d7i8qf8a1bg1000,2.0,"The managers in the PetsHotel and store are inconsiderate, underpay their staff and both are easily irritable. The rest of the staff is great and friendly. Work pace is fast, you play with dogs and take care of cats."
PetSmart,1d7gj1rvs52t2800,5.0,"My managers were excellent with interpersonal interactions with both coworkers and customers, my hours were fair and flexible, and they worked with my other job as well as possible. I had no issues getting more hours or getting days off, and I was often picked for special projects that reflected my specialties and skills. I was treated as a peer instead of just an employee."
PetSmart,1d7gfii1p1ahj000,1.0,"I think the reason it was not enjoyable was possibly just the location I was located at. I applied for the grooming saloon. When they called me for the job they said because my friend was employed in their saloon they did not want us together, they proceeded to offer me a job in pet care and I said yes. When I arrived for the interview I was now told I was going to be a cashier. I accepted it thinking there would be an opportunity to advance somewhere. Many things were just not quite right, for example they needed me full time but refused to give me full time due to not wanting me to have benefits, I was worked 39.5 hours a week. Which in my area is .5 under full time. We are a corporate owned store. So as employees which is in a training video, we have the right to call corporate at anytime we deemed appropriate. In fact the training video encouraged us to do so if we had found something, that the mangers ignored. Well there were two times were two people wanted to contact corporate and told the managers. It was handled unprofessional and resulted in the mangers telling the employees they should not do that, even going so far to lecture one of them. For me personally I left due to the multiple other personal things happening in life at the moment that took away from me being able to work the hours I was given. However, I do know they recently employed a new manager in the grooming saloon who's managed to clear the house within only a few months if that. I think this pet smart location in particular is unprofessional, and inconsiderate to their employees. Also a note I want"
PetSmart,1d7g9pobj24gb000,4.0,"A typical day consists of helping customers, fixing parts of the store, doing daily tasks like taking care of animals and helping around the store. The managers do not work well with others. They are contently in bad moods from outside of work and take it out on the other employees. The managers also are not reasonable and complain when people deserves raises."
PetSmart,1d7fralei1ba1000,5.0,"It was enjoyable getting to learn new things nearly every time I was in there. Whether it be taking time to visit with pets and their owners, or learning new things about different products to help animals, it was a great place to work."
PetSmart,1d7fotr3d5j51800,4.0,"Stressful environment and PetSmart upper management demands too much from employees with only 50% commission. In my store we are like a family and help each other, but they are not all the same."
PetSmart,1d7fn4dtk1ba1000,3.0,"I was a bather at Petsmart for a few months. I enjoyed my job but I enjoy working under harsh or stressful conditions. I worked hard and pushed my limits. Sometimes the job was hard. Rushing to get dogs out quickly and still do a thorough job. Sometimes it was hard to get all the dogs ready on time plus handle walk in baths, walk in nail trims, and answer the phones. I was offered advancement relatively quickly due to good performance. I work well under pressure. I left to pursue a vet tech career instead as I felt it was more rewarding in addition to challenging."

PetSmart,1d7fc3hii1ai5000,1.0,"I worked in the grooming salon as a bather. the issue wasn't that it was fast paced because that didn't bother me. My salon manager never did their job and would constantly comment on everyone else when they weren't doing their jobs either. They would constantly swear at the dogs and comment on how much they hated them. Bathers were expected to have 8 dogs a day and answer the phone, do walk ins, and all the cleaning while the groomers just stood around and did nothing. Groomers weren't allowed to do walk ins even if the bathers were busy. All the groomers were stuck up and had preferences to what kind of dogs they were scheduled. Some times groomers would steal bathers tips even tho groomers made commission and bathers made next to nothing. The store ASM would come in the grooming salon to stand around and would get grossed out when a dog would even try to touch them. We had a new groomer that ended up hurting multiple dogs and still wasn't fired. when you complained to HR about a manager HR would go tell that manager who complain about them."
PetSmart,1d7dncooq1ahj000,4.0,"I liked coming to work and doing the job, we got a new manager and she didn't seem to care how hard you worked. She picked favorites and made it an impossible place to work."
PetSmart,1d7djd9t81ai5000,3.0,It was crazy to me that one person can work alone in the building while taking care of a lot of animals. Just didn't seem safe to me.  I think at least two people should always work the over night hours.
PetSmart,1d7de8jm824gr000,1.0,Petdumb DC is absolutely the worst place I've ever worked for. It's so bad I quit w/o any notice. Best decision I ever made in my life!!! I would rather pick up cans alongside the road than work here!!
PetSmart,1d7db2vo51ahj000,5.0,Its was the most fun job ive ever had. Working with animals is just amazing. You enjoy the relationship that people have with their animals and you become special part in their own way of life because you help take care of one of their loved ones.
PetSmart,1d7d55l5n1d02000,5.0,"I worked in the petcare department while also being a cashier when needed. As soon as you get your job down, it is so easy. Don't slack off if you are in petcare because you are working with animals not just products."
PetSmart,1d7a8vrkm1d18000,4.0,Worked at petsmart 3 years. Took 5 months off for medical leave. When I came back they treated me like a new employee and didn’t let me do my old job. When I left I was pet care certified and was always on the sales floor. I came back and could no longer help on sales floor. Was put on register. Didn’t feel I was helping pet parents to my full potential anymore..
PetSmart,1d78s3efl52t1800,2.0,"A typical work day is being in a camp with 14+ dogs at a time nd making sure they are properly and safely taken care of. I have learned better communication skills and time management, costumer service and learning to resolve problems with others. The management isn't all that great at times but I've learned to cope with it. The workplace culture is a fast and overwhelming place at times but is fun. The hardest part of the job is dealing with costumers at times in stressful situations. The most enjoyable part of the job, I get to play with dogs and show my love and care to them."
PetSmart,1d78nnv5j1bg6000,3.0,I love working with the animals every day but my hours slowly started dropping over time and now its like 15 hrs or less a week. Im not even paid that much either. Id stay if they actually cared more about paying well.
PetSmart,1d77joq625nd1800,4.0,They can't seem to keep anyone on. People are constantly not showing up for work with no call and don't get in trouble but people who do call and are actually sick get penalized for not being able to come in.
PetSmart,1d76enl1o1fdq000,1.0,They do not follow their mission. They make it a big deal to memorize it but its for reciting purposes only. They dont treat pets with the best care. If you knew what went on behind the doors you would not actually board your pets.They don't treat their employees with respect.They promote within even if that person isn't fit for the job. Management is either aloof or micro managing you.
PetSmart,1d766846i1d0a000,3.0,"Perfect for animal lovers.  The customers are great because they love pets of all variety, just like the staff.  The company is actively involved in the humane treatment of all animals.  Petsmart works with local communities/animal shelters to care for and place pets in forever homes.  Regular training in best practices for pet welfare."
PetSmart,1d760vks224fp000,5.0,"i come into work, i take care of my morning duties, sweeping around the register watering the cat grass, dusting the registers, down stocking the treat wall etc. I learned a lot about all different types of animals and breeds about their well being, types of food that would be good for them, bathe them, etc. We have daily meetings,  also for positive reinforcement we receive these care cards, that describe the great performance that we execute. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with shady customers, as well as scammers, which are customers trying to scam you out of money or their products. Finally the most enjoyable part of the job would have to being playing with and interacting with different types of animals all shapes and sizes."
PetSmart,1d75isdtt24e9000,1.0,They demanded alot out of one person it was draining. The ever changing policy made it a unhealthy environment for the pets. If you have a great passion for animals I do not recommend.
PetSmart,1d755uaqm1d0a000,4.0,Good work environment. No emergency work.
PetSmart,1d74h6hks1ah3000,1.0,"I loved working at PetSmart until I started getting talked about behind my back, being called useless, management doesn't care about the people they just pretend to care. And they only actually start to pretend to care when you tell them you are leaving because they don't want to ""train"" new people."
PetSmart,1d73espuq1bg6000,2.0,"I love animals, but this job was a bit messy at times. Also, the managers could be rude but you had to learn to laugh it off like you were unbothered. Scheduling is a mess and the pay wasn't the best. Overall 2/5."
PetSmart,1d72ru1g01d0p000,5.0,"The people are so kind and the managers are very nice. Easy to work with and get along with. Only problem is they are very unorganized and change too many things, makes it hard to keep up with."
PetSmart,1d72fkojr1agm000,4.0,You rely on others to be fair on the books with dogs. Salon manager did the best he could with what he had to do. A lot of times Petsmart pushed the sales over the needs of the pet. Groomers weren't paid for working on floor unless they didn't commision out for the week. Which was very hard to not be able to.
PetSmart,1d716mrid24em000,4.0,"A daily routine for me at PetSmart is making sure all customers are greeted, checked in, cleaned and clipped. I communicate with the customers about their expectations of the groom they are looking for. Recommending products to improve their pet's health. As manager I make sure that schedules are written, company goals are met by myself and my staff. As a company we strive to keep the pets our number one priority and to be transparent with the ""pet parents"". The most enjoyable part of work is the animals and seeing the sheer joy they give you. I would say the hardest part is making sure my staff understand that policy changes are meant to help protect the animal's safety and drive sales and not to make more work that is ""money driven"" but that all we do is meant to be accommodating to not only the pet parent but them as well."

PetSmart,1d6uf84681d0l000,4.0,"I worked for Petsmart for 4 years. For the first two years everything was great. It was my first job too. I loved the animals, liked learning about said animals, learned about customer service, very nice customers and management was nice and fair. I started to see the cracks when a certain manager was bullying employees by cutting the hours of the ones she did not like, getting them written up and intimidating them into helping her steal from the company by ringing her up for very discounted items. If anyone said something about it they were at risk of loosing their job. She was on a power trip and got away with it for years cause she was the store managers favorite. Me and this manger started not to see eye to eye and she started cutting my hours to get me to quit. Nope, I would not, then she started writing my up for tardies because she would change the schedule without notifying me when I already had it written out or printed out. We got a new store manager and I had to bring up the situation with him to explain what was going on. She ended up getting fired when she was caught stealing. For awhile things were good and I was doing well at the job. I left when I got a better paying job."
PetSmart,1d6u7uei31d05000,3.0,I did cashier for 3 years there and it was pretty laid back and was good schedule for a school schedule if you have one. Animals that came in were the best.
PetSmart,1d6t2h16t24em000,1.0,"The people here were fantastic - coworkers, managers, customers. However, the general manager (Dave) was just impossible to work with. He micromanages everything and doesn’t give you any opportunities to learn and grow. He would even come in off the clock to “shop” and would just micromanage, criticize, and nag for an hour. As for the other managers, they were generally very helpful and understanding if you needed to take a day off or switch. Just don’t take advantage of them."
PetSmart,1d6s68hpe5j4r800,2.0,"when I worked at PetSmart the place was infested with rats.

PetSmart,1d6rq0je11d0l000,4.0,If you love animals it is great to work at. Coworkers were some of the best people I know and I enjoyed working here for as long as I did. Not much pay and not much advancement however.
PetSmart,1d6rk0j1724g6000,3.0,I took a part time summer job at PetSmart and it was stressful. We were always just barely staffed to the point that there would be 3 of us in the building. The managers were mean and would intimate customers at times. They were very strict about the time off policy even though I would give my requests weeks in advance.
PetSmart,1d6ri34hs52su800,1.0,I worked at PetsHotel (PetSmart) for over a year and my experience is horrible. There is strong favoritism and a ton of work if you are just a regular associate. Seniors (supervisors) are super lazy they don't even wanna get their hands dirty. They also treat dogs and cats poorly like they don't clean their room when there is pet waste lying around for hours in the rooms.
PetSmart,1d6rhuri124fm000,5.0,"Petsmart is the place for you if you love working with animals. Personally I work in the PetsHotel as a PetCare Specialist and absolutely love getting to hang out , cuddle, & play with all different breeds of dogs & cats."
PetSmart,1d6r067ii52su800,4.0,"Petsmart is amazing! Great place to work, the salon is a blast. But, you have to wait to become a groomer. If youre willing to put the time in to work hard and learn quickly, you can probably go to academy in a year, maybe less if they have the space and youre good. Be patient. Its worth it."
PetSmart,1d6qv9gs01fdl000,5.0,Great job if you love animals. Definitely work there if passion is big for you. You're given the task to educate yourself and others to improve quality of life for the animals you are selling.

PetSmart,1d6p9v6gb24g3000,3.0,"Fast paced, hard work, stressful, a constant battle with the hours given and trying to stay in budget: but on the flip side, it can be very boring at times, slow, and hard to please customers"

PetSmart,1d6n7uvuj24g3000,1.0,Very abused animals. Low hours low pay just no I don’t recommend anyone work at Petsmart ever. The discount sucks you get %50 off of low quality food and %15 off of good products
PetSmart,1d6m5keea24f3000,2.0,"I was hired as a bathing trainee, still in training and i had made a couple mistakes because i was still learning. manager kicked me out of the salon and forced me to train as a cashier with little to no hours and no second chance in the salon. i learned from my mistakes and never repeated them yet they still kicked me out in the end because they care more about their reputation than their employees"
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1d6kffa9o52ss800,2.0,"I started off strong there. I enjoyed going to work. My team, managers, the environment. But over the last several years it has declined dramatically. The new customer discounts they rolled out where they take half the discount off the groomers pay is not ethical. Managers can package it anyway they like but it's not something I agreed to. And it adds up. Being told to work harder to make up for the loss of income isn't right. When the A/C broke last summer, it got well above 80F into the 90s and they made us work. They had us break policies left and right. And if we didn't, we were just being negative or complain too much. Salon understaffed? Grooming dogs and cats alone. Employee mishandling animals, on the cusp of abuse, they tell us they are handling it but it took months of reports of this person before they simply transferred her to another salon where she escalated to abuse and got fired. Want to leave? Don't tell them what salon you are going to. They will call the new job and threaten legal action if you bring any of your clients with you."
PetSmart,1d6k82nrb5ncs800,3.0,"PetSmart was a fun place to work, if you're an animal lover. Management was relaxed. People are nice. They rotated people to work the register, so one person wasn't stuck there all day. Pay was on the low side, just above minimum. No real benefits. Nice discounts."
PetSmart,1d6k5rn6l1d13000,4.0,Flexible hours.
PetSmart,1d6jdgto8ak8r800,5.0,"I enjoyed working for pet smart, I worked there part time after school and on weekends.  I joined the United States Air Force after I graduated high school in 2000."
PetSmart,1d6i8lht85j4q800,1.0,I worked at Petsmart Dc38 for 4 years. Always told I did a great job but overlooked for awards and advancement.  Management changes makes it impossible to be recognized because they don't know the good worker from the slackers. Raises 50 cent or less annually. Pay is very average unless you plan on working 70 hrs a week.
PetSmart,1d6hgh89q24ej000,5.0,"The management team is so great, I still go back with my dog and the managers know me by name. They are professional and helpful and the workplace is very fun to be in if you love animals."
PetSmart,1d6gqv3ugak4s800,5.0,I absolutely Love Petsmart!! I would go back in a heartbeat! The atmosphere at this location is the best and it is always moving and the customer service is amazing for such a small store! I was glad that I got to be a part of it from the beginning!
PetSmart,1d6gqio6pakcp800,4.0,"Extremely fun place to work especially with all the animals, but they don't give enough hours to support myself and there is no such thing as a full-time employee so benefits are off the table. any full time employees you see were grandfathered in once they went to only part time hours."
PetSmart,1d6fhim47ak8r800,1.0,"A typical day at work is hectic. There is no communication about what was done by the previous shift, there is only a checklist of tasks that is not approved by HR and most days you have to pick up the slack that others left you with, leaving you with less time to do your own job. The management is barely trained and expected to do everything correctly right off the bat, leaving a lot of miscommunication. There is so much drama it is unbelievable, you can't even trust managers to keep conversations confidential. If you file an HR report for some reason, 1. everybody will find out if you tell a single manager in confidence, and 2. HR won't take you seriously and do the bare minimum to help you. Lord help you if you are ever harassed by a manager because nothing will be done about it and the only escape from it is quitting. The hardest part of the job is remaining level-headed and professional while managers and other employees give you major attitude over nothing at all. On a positive note, you learn a lot from working there, you do research, you learn from other employees as well as customers and sometimes they know more than you do about certain subjects. You'll look forward to seeing your regular customers and chatting with them about the health of whatever animal(s) they own. Do your best to learn their names, that way they feel like its a more personal encounter when they come in, it makes them feel at home."
PetSmart,1d6f54qu2brcr800,4.0,"I worked nearly 5 years there and barely made it far. I ended up transferring to another store in another state ( due to personal reasons for leaving prior state ) and though I loved where I worked at my last store, it was nice pace, lots to do, etc. I was still not given E.O.t.M, no matter how hard I worked, whether I worked over thr 40 hours ( though I was only given between 20 and 30 hours, depending on the time of the year ) and even when trying to get to full-time, they always told me that it wasn't possible but yet my other co-worker, barely worked there a year, had made to full-time and only doing half of what I would do. It's a good starting job but it's not worth staying the many years that I've stayed because unless you prove yourself, despite how hard you have to do that, there's no growth, though I was promised that there was a way to grow within the company."
PetSmart,1d6ei59qjb894800,1.0,"It was awful. They seen to prefer management/employees that can not even manage themselves... And SL, ASL, and even basic key holders walk around with a bone to pick and definitely too much make-up. Just saying if you do the hard work there your face would wash off."
PetSmart,1d6e23fe7b855800,4.0,Great place to work although some inconsistency. Overall exiting workplace. I would definitely recommend petsmart to any pet lover. Some coaching for improvement opportunities.
PetSmart,1d6dtcadfaqgs800,5.0,"A typical day in my position at PetSmart would be coming in at 5a every morning and immediately respond to emails, work and file paperwork, and stocking the shelves. I learned many things from handling cash, working with customers and their needs, to learning all management duties. Its a very fast paced environment. A lot to get done in a short amount of time, which I very much enjoy. so I would have to say that its the hardest but yet the most fun part of the job."
PetSmart,1d6cktsk05j4k800,4.0,"Working with the animals is easily the best part of the job, Co-workers are easily the second best part, and the managers are not bad either. Overall, Great environment"
PetSmart,1d6cdqrii52sm800,5.0,"I worked at pet smarts for about 6 years and enjoyed every moment. It taught me a lot about people, pets and customer service. But what I learned most was respect and how to listen to customers."
PetSmart,1d6cbg7osb815800,5.0,"Petsmart is a very fun and easy going place to work.  There is also a huge reward in educate pet parents and to help them solve problems.  Of course, it is also amazing to get to pet and meet new dogs everyday."
PetSmart,1d6c9l17dbrcr800,4.0,"Company has job titles split into teams which makes everyone’s job as a whole work really well. Morning huddles to motivate you, but small chance to advance unless you want to volunteer and be cross trained as a cashier and not get a raise for it. Otherwise fun and fast paced job with lots of pets as customers."
PetSmart,1d6c6n6nvb855800,3.0,Have worked for better companies as far as management.is concerned.
PetSmart,1d6bvnro7as0p800,5.0,"I loved working here! If you're an animal lover, this place is for you. You get to work with animals all day, help customers, and learn a lot about animals and what it takes to keep them happy."
PetSmart,1d6b7dtfp5ncn800,3.0,You get burned out quickly because of sales plans and there is very little room for advancement. Great to be around the customers and there pet/s and they appreciate all your help and come back to see you regularly.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1d6a8ndgeb815800,4.0,"Really fun part time job if you love animals & don't mind cleaning up after them or the kennels. Small and large dogs. Hardest part of the job would be cleaning the kennels. Best part, playing with puppies all day!"
PetSmart,1d69oj4u7b813800,4.0,My experience at PetSmart was very fun I was a early morning stocker and cashier and they actually taught me a lot about how to handle money and how to operate a cashier and how to stock merchandise how to do a lot in the beginning of my work experience as a 17 year old kid I feel that was one good job I actually could of stayed at forever but nothing last forever but all in all thumbs up to PetSmart.
PetSmart,1d69efghob892800,5.0,Have to love all different kind of animals and help customers and restock and customer service and do your job right and help where ever is needed and enjoy your job
PetSmart,1d692agd35j4i800,1.0,The store manager is horrible lazy and never compliments you only if she likes you .She would find a way to get you fired .I was there for 13 years and when she came to be store manager everything went down hill. She went out of her way to get me fired.
PetSmart,1d68tepug52sk800,4.0,".Fun place to work, amazing co-workers and managers."
PetSmart,1d68pcq3ib853800,4.0,"While I worked here, I was able to establish good working relationships with all of my fellow staff members, whether they be managers or associates. This made working at this company great, as we were all on the same page and everybody had a shared sense of respect for one another."
PetSmart,1d66assfgb80r800,3.0,"Worked lots of varied hours during different days of the week depending on need. It was fun to see all the animals brought into the store. Really busy days though, and often short staffed. However, this was many, many years ago."
PetSmart,1d64psmgt24fv000,3.0,Management could have been better but overall a fun work environment for all.  I enjoyed being able to learn and grow with the company.   Petsmart location is under new management.
PetSmart,1d64bie8d52sh800,4.0,"They teach you everything you need to know about working in retail, as well as provide a lot of safety training, as you will be working with live animals."
PetSmart,1d647429mak4n800,4.0,"It's a retail job doing retail things. Not meant to support a family unless a manager or been there a long time, was an ok job and it wasn't bad, people were nice to work with and helped out."
PetSmart,1d63u0p91ak4n800,2.0,"Before being purchased, PetSmart had a great company culture with managers who were salaried, with good benefits and actually cared about the animals as well as the employees."
PetSmart,1d63523o4as0k800,4.0,"I loved stocking and helping customers find what they needed for there pets.  I  had many jobs such as barber, cashier and was asked to take a management position.  I loved my job at Petsmart just wish the pay was higher."
PetSmart,1d632q405akck800,4.0,"I really love working with my co-workers, but I was never given hours to work and they kept hiring people to come in when we didn't have hours to give. I am a Pet Care Associate but I was trained on the Register, however, I almost never get to work in pet care after 5 months when they hired 2 new workers. I even told my manager how unhappy this made me, I asked for just one shift in pet care a week but was just given a pat on the back and told to wait. I made some really great relationships but I thoroughly dislike my experience working here. Management is generally great otherwise, but one mistake (like forgetting to ask for register backup) and I would get chided. I learned a lot from working here like how to give medicine to an animal and the proper care of sick pets. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to interact with customers pets and having great conversations with those customers."
PetSmart,1d628abadb84r800,4.0,The company is great to work for if you have a love for animals. You get to work by them and have a rewarding job finding new animals to homes. It is a fast-paced work environment and can be stressful at times.
PetSmart,1d6152jkebrch800,4.0,"It is a enjoyable job, but it can be stressful depending on management. I was trained for over a month, and kept learning during the years I worked there. However, some of the newer associates are only trained for a few days before they are expected to do everything on their own with no problems."
PetSmart,1d60obund0mcv000,4.0,"You are expected to go a lot of work and take on grooming a lot of dogs, but they have awesome benefits/ Bathers are expected to do  dogs an hour groomers have a little more control but still dont have much support."
PetSmart,1d5vqq4cgaqgl800,3.0,Management didn't act like they wanted to help. They asked a lot of you. Didn't really go in depth with explaining. Expected you to know everything. Would not properly train you.
PetSmart,1d5vg4idhbrch800,2.0,Constant gossip and bad mouthing of coworkers. Mexican coworkers racist against me.  Catty and cruel environment. They have criminals working there. I was harassed and pushed to my limits. I was underappreciated and underpaid. Just a terrible environment all around. I really enjoyed working with the dogs. I was given way too many large dogs in a single shift and my back was in bad shape by the time I moved on.
PetSmart,1d5unng3iaqgl800,3.0,Pretty decent place to work. I loved my coworkers and managers. Only bad thing would be is that they give you wrong info about the pets and don't care. I ended up doing my own research to make sure I was telling Pet Parents the correct information. Just seems like the company just wants the money and doesn't care about the animals.
PetSmart,1d5uh0njhakck800,1.0,"you are expected to work non stop, phone ringing off the hook, stressed dogs, walk in services out way dogs with appointment.  Every time a walk in service comes in a dog with appointment gets put away,  sometimes 5-10.  Each time stresses dog and groomer out.  No respect is given to employees."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1d5ue55vo5nci800,3.0,The pay does nothing to compensate for the amount of stress leveled on the employees. That coupled with inconsistent hours made me want to leave this position.
PetSmart,1d5tabssdas0k800,4.0,"First duty when coming in was to sanitize all the dogs crates, set all machines on standby. As the dogs came in on there scheduled appointment i would bathe them do glands if requested. I then dry the dogs do there nails and any privates. I assisted other groomers as needed in the bathing or drying area. I would also take care of walk in nails. At the end of the shift the entire salon needs to be cleaned and all filters are to be cleared. Duties also included answering the phone and making appointments. The best part of the job was indeed the animals and all there magnificent personalities. the hardest was the stress that came with the double bookings. All in all it was a company that could help provide growth for animal lovers."
PetSmart,1d5t4s3j75n8j800,3.0,"The way you see this job is based on what position you have. As a cashier, you are either overrun with customers (many of whom are rude and demanding) or you have nothing to do and the hours stretch out in boredom. As a pet care associate, there is almost always something to do, but sometimes there is so much to do its stressful and overwhelming.  The pros of pet care are that you might deal more with animals (who are mostly very sweet) than with angry cat ladies. If you're looking for something part-time, its a great job with nice co-workers and relatively cool managers. The inconsistent hours and low pay are sort of a bust, though."
PetSmart,1d5shtuloakgk800,1.0,this job is very taxing and you're treated horribly for little pay and expected to bend over backwards for management. was understaffed for the whole 3 years I was an employee and there is absolutely no benefit for busting your hind end for management/coworkers as there is no incentives. the only reason I stayed for so long was my manager's flexibility with my schedule through college. about to graduate and I can't wait to get the heck out of this place.
PetSmart,1d5s62qttak8m800,1.0,I wouldn't recommend working at this company unless you are a student just trying to get through school. They will not treat you properly nor reward you for hard work. Constantly under pressure from management to perform without any type of motivation.
PetSmart,1d5rvl60jaqgl800,5.0,"I loved going to work and seeing all the different babies that were with us that day. It was always a good time with the dogs in camp, it could get stressful sometimes but you just need to take a step back and breath. My manager was amazing aswell as my other coworkers, the manager over the store was very rude though."
PetSmart,1d5qkdirqh3kh800,5.0,"I love working at PetSmart. My management is amazing, but you aren’t always so lucky. I’ve been with the company for almost 3 years and I can truly say that my store is like a family. Great hours, great discount, decent benefits, and many advancement opportunities."
PetSmart,1d5q5hd770kbv000,1.0,So Much shady stuff happens at Petsmart. They have no actual nutritional knowledge about pet food because nothing sold at Petsmart is premium dog food.
PetSmart,1d5q3qgejas0j800,2.0,"I've been working for Pet Smart for almost ten years. They over work their employees. The overnights are treated badly and the pay is awful for what you have to do in this job. They accept just about any dog whether you can get a lead on them or not and whether they are aggressive or not. Even when the policy is if you can't get a lead on the dog you can't accept it. They accept them anyways and it takes MONTHS before they finally tell the pet parent we can't have the dog there anymore. Overnights have to walk up to 70 dogs BY themselves when they're busy, which is tiring. They give you a hard time when you call in even if you NEVER call in and it's something important like your car won't start or something. The only good thing about this job are the animals. That's the ONLY reason I have been with this company for so long and also I didn't really have another choice. If it wasn't for the dogs I'd probably be gone a long time ago. The benefits are really good if you're full time I'll give them that. All in all I wouldn't work for Pet Smart. Their pay is bad and so is their management. Promote just about anyone and they're lazy."
PetSmart,1d5piu8qfak8l800,2.0,Its good for a first job. I learned a lot of good life lessons and it helped me a lot with my social skill. After that though its time to get out and get a real Job.
PetSmart,1d5pcvfngakgj800,3.0,"Customers at PetSmart were always nice, except a few, which is normal with any job. Fast paced environment, management was nice, yet sometimes, they did not see the underlining problems."
PetSmart,1d5pc0drj5nch800,5.0,love to learn about taking good care of your pets and get learn how to groom that's a plus great people to work with and fun environment. GREAT PLACE.
PetSmart,1d5nlmd580mcu000,4.0,"Petsmart days were always pretty active, even during the slow days we still had a steady flow of customers coming in for pet supplies. The managers were very interactive and helped with day to day in-store duties, they were always quick to jump on a register if we were getting swarmed with customers and would promptly attend to customers if an associate was too busy to get to them."
PetSmart,1d5nemmu4b84n800,1.0,Not a good place to work.  Always looked down upon by management if you are unable to reach their unreasonable goals.  Never praised for accomplishing goals.
PetSmart,1d5ndppttb88o800,3.0,"Not too stressful since there are always multiple employees around to help, flexible time schedules, good hours. They do not put enough emphasis on their living animals  but it could be worse."
PetSmart,1d5nbo8poaqgk800,4.0,The general manager at the time was just okay. I heard there is a new sheriff in town that is 10 times better. I would have enjoyed the job more if other employees would have been more helpful. Lots of drama
PetSmart,1d5l0jmn1ak8h800,1.0,The hardest part of my job was to see people abusing dogs in the two locations I work at. Manager not doing their job in taking care of costumers. Hiring couple to work in the same environment causing problems at work.
PetSmart,1d5kuprmj0mtv000,3.0,"This location specifically does not have a good store manager.  Company sets high metrics that are very difficult to meet and prevent you from the quarterly bonuses offered. Customers can be the hardest part of the job; but the animals are definitely the best.  They do not give you all the tools needed to complete projects on time.  I would feel as if I was being set up to fail.  However, each store is different."
PetSmart,1d5k7h4700mct000,4.0,great place to learn new real life applications of being a pet parent and educating customers to learn more about a new pet they may not have known they would enjoy.
PetSmart,1d5j3fnm70mtv000,4.0,Great interaction with customers in-store and over the phone

PetSmart,1d5hi08d30mct000,4.0,"I worked at Petsmart for about seven months. It was a fun company to work for and I was offered a lot of job variety (cashier, stocking shelves, pet care associate, dog bather, etc.). However, I was only ever scheduled 20 hr. per week or less. I honestly loved the job and would have stayed on longer, if only they had given me more hours a week."
PetSmart,1d5fu0frl0mte000,1.0,"If you kiss up in this company, you'll go far. If you don't, forget it. You have to be a favorite to get any kind of good wage."
PetSmart,1d5f99d8n1ahu000,4.0,"I loved working there. It was one of the few jobs I have had that I actually like. Managers were great, the pay was decent. You were able to get paid every week."
PetSmart,1d5f760mmaqgg800,1.0,Typical day at work was- showing up an hour early to set up and make calls before training classes started.
PetSmart,1d5e19m8t1d1d000,3.0,I enjoy working here I just don’t appreciate the fact that I only work 5 hours a day for four days a week. I’m a college student who has things to pay for I’ve been asking multiple time for more hours and they denied it and instead hired more people which led to me getting less hours.
PetSmart,1d5dcav4kak4h800,4.0,"I began my employment part time with Petsmart in 1996,  as a pet bather and was soon offered the opportunity to train through a two year contract with Petsmart, to become a Professional Pet Groomer and through this opportunity , I carried on with my Grooming Career throughout 2015"
PetSmart,1d5ctdpof0mtv001,4.0,"Petsmart is a nice place to work for. I am glad that have been working there for almost 2 years now. The people I work with are absolutely amazing. Ever since I started at petsmart, my knowledge of animals has expanded a lot."
PetSmart,1d5b3j2ni1ahu000,4.0,I was looking for a part time job that I know I would enjoy. Petsmart with the perfect fit for me. I love working with people and I love animals especially dogs.
PetSmart,1d59u5h291ahu002,4.0,The job is very productive and constant pace. Everything has to be stocked and ready for customers before the store is open. The pay is low but everyone is confident and respectful in getting the job done.
PetSmart,1d59qes6iaqgg800,4.0,"The store has a great environment, staff, and customers. Willing to cross train if you ask and always willing to show you new things at the store I worked. However, the hours are terrible. You work about 20 hours a week."
PetSmart,1d5986gkp1d0e000,3.0,It's alot of hard work and not enough pay. When I was there the magement was rude and unhelpful except for one person. It is not all puppy kisses and giggles. It's tears and blood and alot of helping other people.
PetSmart,1d58fmiqg0kbq000,4.0,I love working here. I always look forward to going to work! The people are friendly and I am always lucky enough to learn new tasks. I would always recommend working at PetSmart!
PetSmart,1d585fbc41ahc000,4.0,"It's great, especially if you like animals and learning about how to take care of them. They don't pay the best, but it's comparable to your average retail job in that respect. My team in pet care is great and super cooperative. The workplace culture in that regard is absolutely the best I've ever personally experienced at a job like this. mgmt is what you'd expect. Not too bad if you do your job but sort of tricky to communicate with."
PetSmart,1d57jr7tv0kbq000,4.0,"Depending on your position, your day will be very different. Working in pet care is very routine-based, you work a lot with customers, and with all the animals in the store (small animals, reptiles, birds, fish, and insects). I love my job and getting to work with/learn about animals. It also seems to attract a good group of people (co-workers) because we all love animals. I've learned a lot, more than any other retail job. The cons are low pay, issues with training/advancement, and doing A LOT of hard work for such low hourly pay. Overall, I would recommend working at PetSmart if you're an animal lover and willing to work with all types of animals/pets."
PetSmart,1d56a2vg91d19000,4.0,"I LOVED working at this petsmart in the pets hotel. I got to play with dogs all day and as a dog lover, it was a dream come true! It also taught me a lot about animal safety as well as helped me to conquer my fears of some breeds of dogs."
PetSmart,1d55ukg4p1ahp000,1.0,"I was hired on with the promise of being full time. That was almost a year ago, but instead they transferred someone behind my back at the last second before they made me full time, which still am not full time. No benefits even though they have me work crazy hours, some weeks I'm lucky to get over 30 hours, but usually always under 30. Even if you show how badly you want to advance, managers dont care unless its convenient for them (for example if someone quits). I am cross trained with everything in the store except management, so they except me to work even harder for less pay. Definitely not a job for the long run unless you can get into management, but even then... the AOL or lead associate complains all the time about how much pressure gets put on all the managers from the store manager."
PetSmart,1d55cvmdh1bab000,5.0,You will meet a lot of people. See a lot of animals. They have different areas to work at. Management was really complicated. Co-workers were awesome to work with.
PetSmart,1d55bi9k71d0a000,1.0,groomers abused dogs and management did nothing about it. people came in high and HR didnt care. i wouldnt recommend working for this company. they dont care about the employees or the animals in their care.
PetSmart,1d55a0qc81agr000,4.0,This was a good place to work that offered opportunities for advancement in most areas. Obedience training was always my favorite part of that job. You got regular pay raises based off of your performance but I never had a vacation. They had decent health coverage.
PetSmart,1d54r72ik0mcp000,5.0,"When I worked here i was a bit younger, but i made great friends, also management was pretty great as well, really loved this job, pay wasnt great but retail usually isnt, I really loved this once i started in the salon"

PetSmart,1d54nah750mta000,5.0,"There are plenty of opportunities to advance, there are fun on-campus events, there is an onsite gym, daycare and cafe for lunch.  And you can bring your pet to work!!"
PetSmart,1d54lkkgd1bab000,3.0,"1 manager, 1 cashier.....never staffed sufficiently."
PetSmart,1d5315n2j1agi000,2.0,"If you’re just looking to supplement your existing job or work while going to school this job is ok. But it in no way pays living wages. I’ve been here for two years and only make $10.30/hr. Even if I was working full time I wouldn’t be able to pay bills or rent. People come and go quickly here, never staying for long because the company is terrible to its employees. They care more about whether you wear your name tag and if you follow the script given to “assist” people then if you’re happy to be there. We are advised not to say no to people who want an animal despite them not knowing anything about the animal, not caring about our suggestions for keeping the animal, and not having the proper enclosure for the animal. Don’t work here! This place shouldn’t be selling animals!"
PetSmart,1d522ob211ai3000,4.0,"Working for Pet Smart taught me so much regarding animals! Grooming was a great job for me! It involved working in a shop with other groomers, cleaning kennels daily, answering phones, making appointments, calling to remind clients of their appointments, checking dogs in and out of salon, cleaning salon on a daily basis, grooming at least 6/7 dogs a day. If we had no clients for an hour or so we would help out on the floor, stocking shelves or helping customers on the floor! I had to leave due to a major health problem back then!"
PetSmart,1d50suurv1ai3000,2.0,"Not too bad a place if you want to start learning how to work with animals, but that's about it. Many locations are nasty, have poor managers, or just not enough hours. I left my store due to a rat infestation they failed to contain along with a large amount of people leaving due to poor management."
PetSmart,1d50lp2l30kbi000,5.0,"My experience with PetSmart has and is still a great one. The hours are pretty flexible and the managers are all very kind, understanding, and helpful. Whether it's a first, second, or third job, I do recommend the experience of working at the Willow Grove PetSmart."
PetSmart,1d50eu3t60mt2000,5.0,"I really just wanted the job while in college for the summer. They were very flexible with my internship schedule and the environment is fun and happy. There is no way that seeing pets everyday can make you unhappy, and the people that work with me were very positive and you can tell they are happy doing what they do."
PetSmart,1d4vvd8c01ahi000,4.0,management could be done better on store managers part but sales and pet care manager where great and more then asked or excepted. pet care services where good as most employees knew a decent amount about the animals.
PetSmart,1d4vtdi791bg2000,1.0,SUCKED . Management was rude !!!
PetSmart,1d4viejts1agi000,3.0,This was a seasonal position.  So I do not have alot to say about the company. the tenure was not long enough to truly give insight into the company so I will not be able to comment.
PetSmart,1d4uja52q1d12000,3.0,"Petsmart was a bit slow paced, I worked there mainly because I loooove animals. Seeing animals every day and caring for them was what kept me going. I absolutely loved working around them, but the management wasn't always good, they barely taught me anything.. I had to learn everything myself."
PetSmart,1d4ue91es1d12000,4.0,I found working at PetSmart to be a good experience it has helped me grow as a person and as a employee I learned a lot about animals and working with people and customer sevice.
PetSmart,1d4u39gbh0mt2000,2.0,The associates here are amazing and very helpful and kind. It is a very laid back and comfortable work environment but management is poor. Nothing gets done and they care little about the animals. It’s very rewarding to be around the animals but sad at the same time because managers don’t care when something is wrong with them and there needs to be a change.
PetSmart,1d4t370t21bg2000,2.0,This company has little room for advancement and growth. Pays well and a good learning experience. I worked for 9 years and was an assistant store leader the entire time.  I maxed out in my pay band and they found someone to do my job for less money so I was let go after 9 years of employment. It was very disappointing and upsetting to see the poor management skills of upper management handle the situation the way they did.
PetSmart,1d4rqbbtj1ah2000,5.0,Laid back environment. Easy going staff and coworkers who become much more. The company takes really good care of you by the means of if you call out you don’t get in trouble and if you a long as get your work done you’ll be fine. Thirty minute lunches.
PetSmart,1d4r3n2gk1ahi000,4.0,My time at Petsmart was bi-polar to put it nicely.
PetSmart,1d4qt9amp0mti000,3.0,"Could be great; poor management, training, and stress make it a poor choice with high turnover. For starting out it is a good place to get experience. Not a great long term job for me."
PetSmart,1d4qh2p3u1ba2001,2.0,"Petsmart went to trash ,  used to be a great company to work for. Then they started to make you a salesman and push a million things down each customers throat. And if you don’t meet their quota then your store is punished. Got to be a bit redundant."
PetSmart,1d4qdm5s20mti000,4.0,"If you are not one of the manager's favorite you don't get the hours. It is a fun place to work at as you get to interact with the cats and dogs and their ""mommys and daddys"""

PetSmart,1d4c32895ak93800,4.0,People here are easy to get along with. This company is a great place for a starter job. Also if you love animals it’s a good place to be and meet fellow animal lovers.
PetSmart,1d4banotbakd0800,5.0,I like working with animals this was my first place I worked at that gave me a opportunity to move up. I started off as a bather then they sent to me school to become a dog groomer. good experience
PetSmart,1d4b99b33b80q800,4.0,"Co-workers were awesome, the animals are amazing. Atmosphere is fast-paced and taught me how to multi-task and to get tasks done in timely manner. Would recommend this job to any cat/dog lover."
PetSmart,1d49d7s1qakh0801,1.0,"The work was absolutely wonderful, and I was given much access to the animals and their care. I made some good work frends, and became a confidant to one in particular. We were promoted together, and worked closely to fix some problems left by our predecessors. But one day they told me that they and an associate were involved in extra-relationship activities, in the store and on the clock. The friend was a fairly threatening presence, and I was too afraid to say anything for a few months. In this time, the friend told me more and more of what they did with this other person, and even unabashedly leaving for lunch together only for the one still working to come back with hickies. They started slacking around at work, sitting together or with their ""favorites"" for long periods on the clock, and then complaining about the store starting to look dirty and unkempt. One comment finally pushed me over the edge of discomfort and I decided to tell my store leader. It was relayed to me that SL had confronted the friend, who denied everything, and then started to passive-aggressively punish myself and others i was close with at work. I spoke with my SL again, and was told that they couldn't start any investigation without photo/text proof, and if I felt the ""friend"" was being too passive aggressive, I could fill my resignation right then. I was and still am appalled at this entire situation because my friends are still involved. The stores are corrupt, and corporate is too focused on numbers to care much about the ground employees."
PetSmart,1d49bd8dmakh0801,3.0,"It was a good job to begin my skills and learning dog care/grooming but I didn't receive much support from management and no benefits like vacation offered, they try to keep your hours under full time. The vibe in my particular location was not good and when brought to management attention that I was being targeted nothing was done about it."
PetSmart,1d492isduak93800,4.0,It was fun working with the animals and it was nice to see a lot of customers during adoption events. You get to learn about the animals and care for them.
PetSmart,1d47l8o43b88o800,2.0,"I’ve worked with pretty good managers, and terrible managers there. The biggest problem is they are an incredibly cheap company and leave no room for advancement,  because they would rather save money and just give the person in that position twice as much work load and just  give them a slight bump in pay. Very slight. They ask way too much for what they pay, and do not help you in any way from the top. If you’re lucky, your direct manager may help with some stuff, but then you realize they give them an unrealistic amount of work load also, so you can’t blame your team. To sum it up in a short way, let’s just say they’re a multi billion dollar corporation, and I have been trying for 4 years for it to not be super warm in my department... it’s not a place you want to be overly warm in, creating unnecessary stress. But the temperature is controlled from a different state, and it has yet to be handled after multiple phone calls and back and forth. That should give you a small hint as to what goes on... except it’s with everything, and bigger things also."
PetSmart,1d46l8ddtak52800,4.0,"It's really a fun place to work if you like dogs.  Getting to love on all sorts of dogs and play with them individually.  Checking in at morning time before day camp is consistant, you have to put name bands on them, pet them, check for any bumps bruises or hot spots.  Take them to their room and ensure they have water. You have to check them into the computer and make sure any special services are notated on the break chart, ie.  baths, walks, nails.   Responsible for creating a play list for Doggie day camp and if necessary make sure some dogs who don't necessairily get along aren't in the same playroom.  Assign tasks to the associates that will be working that day with you; cleaning rooms, baths, nails, or individual play times with certain dogs.  January thru March is a little slow not at many people needing a boarding facility. so in these times we assign cleaning to all associates.  There is always something to be cleaned.   If ever I am having a bad day just going into a room and loving on a dog releases the stress of the day.  I have personally learned how to approach people either employees or customers in a different way to make sure everyone is happy and not being condesending to them. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the people who think they deserve a discount all the time.  They can get rather rude and sometimes you just have to call another manager to handle the situation.  Sometimes they call you names and cuss at you but you cant take it to heart.  Another hard part of the job is when occassionally there is a dog fight and a dog gets hurt.  Lots of"
PetSmart,1d4674ib2b88o800,3.0,"I enjoyed working with the animals, I took care of the snakes and feed them. I also worked in receiving on the night crew, it was good steady work. I got along with all the employees."
PetSmart,1d4656padb88o800,4.0,"This job is better than most retail jobs, especially if you love animals. Problem is the pay. No retail/food industry ever pays their employees enough to deal with all the self entitled and angry customers that are coming by day by day. Furthermore, I am not paid enough to try and do more than what I am suppose to do. The company, district managers and managers overall are always trying to get you to go above and beyond just so that the store looks pretty. They don’t pay you enough for the labor being input."
PetSmart,1d45tht5n5ncs800,4.0,"Was a great first job, but wouldn’t recommend if looking for advancement. The old manager was amazing with everything he did for us! I loved working for and with him. The new manager was awful though!! She forced me to quit because my truck broke down on the way to work and the tow truck took forever. I called ahead to let her now what was going on and she said we would discuss it when I got there. When I got there, she pulled me aside to tell me I could quit now or she was going to fire me next week before the schedules came out."
PetSmart,1d45qgckr52ss800,3.0,"Because I was working with small animals, reptiles, birds, and fish, I had many rules to abide by. Which for me was absolutely no problem because I love following directions. There was so much to do and sometimes it would get very stressful when it came to medicating the animals and cleaning the bird cages. I personally did not like the manager because he was very sarcastic, the kind where you never know if he is actually angry at you for something or if he is just joking. I would observe him treating a few customers and employees very unprofessionally. What I mean by this is he was very prone to putting other people down in a joking manner. I watched him do this to a CUSTOMER. I was astounded he was even a manager. The manager that was there before him was an amazing manager and would have had no problem staying if he hadn't been relocated."
PetSmart,1d45q0l025ncs800,3.0,PetSmart is very competitive with advancement and low in pay. The coworkers are wonderful most of the time but the company expects you to do a lot for a very low pay.
PetSmart,1d44u0qk2b80q801,3.0,"I really enjoyed working in the salon when I first started. It's great to be able to learn a trade skill while being paid for it and it's a big plus to be able to work with animals all day even when they misbehave, which is often. The store manager's poor management style slowly weeded out all the best employees to the point where there are only a handful of us left doing the work of a fully staffed team, creating an incredibly stressful work environment. We lose employees and immediately we are pushed to take on more appointments while we are still struggling with what we already have. Each store has an entirely different work culture, so if you are looking to work here make sure you ask an employee what it's like to work there, not a manager. Not every store is this bad, but some of them are worse."
PetSmart,1d449f7a7akgt800,4.0,"It is a fun environment to work for. You can really make friends while working here, but some of the staff isn't so friendly. You can really learn a lot about animals while working here and if you love animals this is your place to be."
PetSmart,1d43u056jakgt800,2.0,"Poor management all around. They only want to focus on pumping out grooms to make as much money as possible, they don't care about the people or the pets themselves."
PetSmart,1d41jehdgas0l800,4.0,PetSmart has offered me a great opportunity to improve my skills and work ethics. I have grown significantly in the short time I have been here. I have gotten coaching from my upper management on how to better myself as a manager.
PetSmart,1d41e1t90brcl800,3.0,"As with most retail, positions are part-time only unless you become a manager. Lots of favoritism from managers, if you weren't in the good graces of a manager, you would know it. My General Manager was awesome and was actually a competent manager, she did her best to treat everyone equally. Some advancement opportunity but not a lot"
PetSmart,1d40v28oaak4l800,5.0,A great place to work with fair benefits and a decent at a rate it is a pretty easy place to work while also being a huge learning opportunity  you'll learn a lot while working here

PetSmart,1d3urs3scb80l800,4.0,"This was a very fun job, it was hard and was stressful at times but overall it was good. It's hard to advance and make more money but it's secure. Lot's of policies to remember customers can be annoying sometimes but that's with any ""retailish job"" My only real complaint was the fact that cooperate did not care at all and they would make all these rules, that they would have no idea effects their ""Lower"" employees. Kind of a joke when it came to benefits in my opinion but it was a good job for a starter."
PetSmart,1d3ufp71sak8m800,4.0,I worked for Petsmart for two years and my overall experience was good. The managers are awesome. They always make sure to work with your schedule and they are very helpful.
PetSmart,1d3u5h0cjakck800,1.0,"I worked at Petsmart for 7 months in the grooming salon. After 5 months I was evaluated to go to grooming academy (#1 reason I took the job) I busted my butt for 5 months to try and get into this school, due to the fact that all my bills were behind from only being part time. It was impossible to try and find a second job that would work around a COMPLETELY different schedule every week. So in November of 2018 I was told that I passed my evaluation, but that there were 8 people and only 7 spots in this particular class, and that since I was the last one to get hired, I was guaranteed a spot in the January class. I was fine with that, I understood. Once it was December, they told me the class got pushed back to February, again I’m fine with that, because I have a locked in spot... then January rolls around and they say it will be sometime in March. I’m frustrated but I still have my spot. Well now it’s been a few months since I’ve been evaluated and they want to evaluate me again. I agree, because I’m pretty confident I will pass..... I don’t. She failed me claiming I did not brush a dog out & I explained that I did, while she was talking to the salon leader instead of watching me to evaluate me fully. She said she would come back that following Wednesday and “give me another chance” so she comes back & I pass with ALL 100’s on EVERYTHING. So I’m convinced I’m in the clear & im packing my bags to ship out to academy. Well a few days later the same woman comes to evaluate another bather, that started in November AFTER I was first evaluated. Just to sum it up at this point, they"
PetSmart,1d3u27grrb88j800,3.0,I was working here during college and I moved up through the company rather quickly but with no additional pay. Once they heard I was starting my career they just took me off the schedule and never told me I was terminated.
PetSmart,1d3s8n325akgk800,3.0,The manager was very nice but he allowed other workers to not finish tasks and to push them off onto others. People who worked hard just ended up with more work. Those who were lazy got away with it. Starting pay is 8.00 an hour. After working there for two years and with positive reviews I still only made 8.65 an hour.
PetSmart,1d3rtsgs6as0l800,1.0,"The job itself was great, working with dogs and talking with customers was relatively easy. It's not snuggling puppies all day, it's a very physically demanding job. If you're good with that, then dog grooming/bathing is good for you. Just be sure you're finding the right salon with the right team members. Some co-workers were fun and worked great, but most of the time everyone was too stressed, grumpy, and it really showed. It really felt like every man for themselves kind of a situation. There were several times where specific co-workers would be having a bad day and the customers could tell. There was no teamwork involved, it was all left to a singular person with zero assistance. On good days, you could get some help if asked, but on bad days, one or two people would be willing to help and unfortunately, they can't always be asked. Everyone else couldn't be bothered."
PetSmart,1d3rohrd6akck800,1.0,Managers promote an environment of cut throat competition between team members. If you are not willing to be involved in petty gossip and back stabbing then you are an outcast and will become the target for their bad behavior. Managers are ruthless and every employee that enters their office comes out crying. Although they call it coaching it is cruel harassment of vulnerable people.
PetSmart,1d3q7q3usak4l800,3.0,"The company has very good ethics on paper, but these don't seem to be upheld at the store level. It seems like stores that can cover up ethics violations are the ones that succeed."
PetSmart,1d3pbkd0m5j4h800,5.0,"Retail is retail, so you'll interact with customers all day. PetSmart customers are more demanding than other retailers I've worked. Many customers come in looking for advice for their animals with no idea what they're doing and they don't really want to take your advice, either. Be prepared for customers to think you're a vet and to be offended when you tell them they have to take their dog to an actual vet."
PetSmart,1d3ooidcrb88j800,3.0,"horrible experience, the only good thing is that I met great customers and outstanding employees that I still keep in contact with. they make you sell everything in store and make your projected sales unreachable at times. as a manager they will fire you for not reaching sales goals, as an employee you have more job security"
PetSmart,1d3n1spe3b84l800,5.0,A great first job.
PetSmart,1d3mqepjsbrcl800,5.0,"My time spent working there was really fun and exciting , the events we planned were always different and very cute to be apart of, the greatest part was the managers are all very nice and understanding of your abilites and challenges and work with you to get you to where you need to be at to succeed in the position you are trying too!"
PetSmart,1d3ltkunm52sj800,4.0,"When I first started there they trained me to follow policies, so I learned to be thorough, because everything there had order. It really was a positive team environment. I worked with the small animals/fish/birds, mostly feeding and cleaning cages. They have a back room for animals that are unwell, so you're back there playing doctor for their minor ailments. I really enjoyed that and it really stuck with me, and now I'm in school for veterinary medicine."

PetSmart,1d3i40pbm1d1b000,3.0,There are opportunities for advancement and on the job learning to help you.  You get to know the regular customers and build a rapport with them.  This helps to increase sales.
PetSmart,1d3hc2vs1ak4h801,1.0,"First of all petsmart is by far the worst job I’ve had. The management only cares about management, they can do no wrong in the head managers eyes.  When I got hired the hiring manager said that they didn’t believe in the  hierarchy everyone is equal , But every time something goes wrong they say the  I’m above you. They schedule you based on how they like you. the head manager calls people in for hour long  “meetings”  and when we get busy he gets mad at everybody else because we are “short staffed” and getting bad surveys."
PetSmart,1d3fsn0qlak8i800,3.0,"I would constantly throw my back out every week because I was always having to lift bags of dog food that would sometimes weigh up to 65 lbs on to high shelves and on top of each other for storage by myself as a small woman. They also do not put effort into finding good quality breeders for their animals, so many sick ones would come in and would not be able to be sell-able."
PetSmart,1d3f3qqu91baf000,5.0,"Always meeting new people. Everyone is always helping with teamwork. Different dogs helps with new experience and tasks. Creating a bond and getting dogs taken care of, and knowing you impacted their health is the most enjoyable."
PetSmart,1d3f3atld1d0t000,4.0,"A typical work day revolves around pet care and customer service. I learned how to work in a team when taking care of animals in the store and how to handle animals brought to the store. Management was great and very flexible with scheduling. The hardest yet most enjoyable aspect of the job was working with the animals, as you learn the many different ways to take care of them."
PetSmart,1d3cs5gdp1d0d000,1.0,"PetSmart expects you to do the work of three people, but don't want to pay you more for it.  The company is so cheap that they refuse to give the store enough hours to have an appropriate amount of people working. Most days I didn't get my 15 minute breaks because we were understaffed and extremely busy. We would get in trouble for not completing certain tasks when we don't have the staff to be able to complete all of the tasks. Management would be incredibly hypocritical about the way talking to guests, getting tasks done, a few would just sit in the office or the desk and not help and then complain that things weren't done. Management would tell me to go to them with any issues or tell them if something is bothering you, but when you do they complain about you coming to them and they don't do anything about it.  Most of the faucets in the hotel leaked, hoses had holes, mop buckets with wheels stuck so they wouldn't roll, locks broken, tiles broken, lack of necessary items to get the job done efficiently.  The company says safety is important.... ya right, if they cared they would replace faucets, tiles, hoses, mop buckets, rabies pole, etc. This company only cares about profit. We weren't able to fit any more dogs during the holidays, but corporate made us take dogs in that didn't have rooms so they could take more money....  So many things messed up with this company and they wonder why they have crazy high turn over rate. The best part of the job was meeting cute dogs and cats and meeting nice people."
PetSmart,1d3cjmstp1d0d000,1.0,Repeatedly told by management that I was ready for promotion and then not given one. Worked at least 12 hours a day (salary position) and those hired after me and working under me made more. High pressure sales goals. Called frequently when at home and actually denied emergency care and sick time on more than one occasion. Management inconsistent and never on the same page. Terrible attitudes in management frustrated team members; had high turnover and no employee buy-in as a result.
PetSmart,1d3chng551d0d000,3.0,Perfect for an associate that just wants to work and go home. No true room for advancement and no empathy for individual situations. Management either can’t assist with problem solving or is unable to be found to assist in problem solving.

PetSmart,1d3a7ndqm1d0d000,1.0,My first day there no one knew that I was starting that day. The manager never told them and had no idea where to put me. I was never on the schedule. I'd get a call when to go in. When I called no one knew when I go in. Week later I got a call asking why I never showed up and that they dont need me anymore.
PetSmart,1d3a72a57as0h800,3.0,The money is good but you have very high expectations which would be fine if they did not take away every tool you needed in order to reach those expectations. They (Petsmart) do not really care about anything except for money. I do not blame management for being the way that they are (uncaring) because they get an incredible amount of pressure from up top.
PetSmart,1d39tf84t1d0d000,1.0,It was an unsafe and unclean workplace with unprofessional and unrealistic expectations. It wasn’t ideal to work here it is absolutely a Segway job with no future.
PetSmart,1d388umm1ak4h800,5.0,"I loved my ability to grow with the company and the lifelong skills I've learned. Now I can take my grooming skills with me wherever I go. I loved the opportunity to make commission, so I had some sort of control of my salary."
PetSmart,1d37puse71d1b000,4.0,I enjoy my work environment and the people I work with. Only reason I would leave is if I could get one full time job that can let me afford cost of living
PetSmart,1d37n13q20kbu000,3.0,"A ton of enrollment videos, then it's sink or swim. No help, stores are functioning on barebones staff so no back up, and long lines with angry customers. Problems also with manager/employee relations, and with management sexually harassing people below them."
PetSmart,1d37je40n0kbu000,3.0,this was my first job in the animal field. I learned a lot of things. Good and bad. i remember how annoying they are with selling extra things to customers and meeting quotas.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1d379n48n1baf000,3.0,"Over all its a good job to work at if you dont have responsibilities already ,but for a young adult unless there giving enough hours for pay its not a good choice"
PetSmart,1d37268f7akgg800,3.0,"My job at PetSmart as a groomer was a very mixed experience. There was some on the job training, but mostly the other groomers seemed reluctant to come over and help. They definitely made it clear who was the ""low man on the totem pole"""". Plus, when one of the more senior groomers complained to a manager about not liking me and not wanting to work with me, they simply let me go without giving me a chance to explain my side of the situation."
PetSmart,1d3604e991fdu000,2.0,I liked working there for a while. But my manager was just rude. She would yell at me for doing what she told me to do. She said I did everything wrong even though I followed the book. I thought I did a good job but I guess not. Also I didnt get many hours there which I didnt like. So I quit because I had already gotten a new job.
PetSmart,1d35q38kf1fdu000,4.0,"The team leads, my manager and everyone I got to work with were nice, understanding and incredible to work with, the only complaint I have, was the pay. For what I worked as, I personally felt I was underpaid. Other than th as t, I truly enjoyed working for petsmart"
PetSmart,1d35fkmq71d0t000,2.0,All computer systems were very old and needed a lot of work. Systems wpuld always shut down amd ran very slow. Bosses play favorites and they mistreated the ones who might need a little extra help
PetSmart,1d35c8sodas0h800,4.0,Typical customer service/retail environment. Learned quite a bit about animals during my time. Learn as you go with the animals. Can always research on the job or be honest if you are unsure.
PetSmart,1d35c3tca1baf000,5.0,My experience working at 3 different PetSmarts has always been good. The people are fun the business is fun and the animals are a blast! My only complaint is the lack of hours given.
PetSmart,1d34bcqdpas0h800,5.0,"Inspiring managers, exciting work, and so many pets to be around!"
PetSmart,1d34arghmak8i800,4.0,"The grooming salon was much different than the retail part of the store. It was much more competitive and a ""dog eat dog"" world. There was a sense of collaboration when it got down to the nitty-gritty though. I would recommend this for someone who needs some retail experience and if they plan to remain working at a place for more than a year."
PetSmart,1d33h9o6u1d0t000,3.0,i had a harder time working here due to the lack of organization and lack of care placed upon the facility. Pretty much there was a shortage of the supplies because manager did not order in advance. And a lack of proper training in multiple positions.
PetSmart,1d31rpkdn0mcn000,5.0,"a Typical work day was quick paced and at some times stressful. during my time at petsmart I learned how to groom and manage a grooming salon. the hardest part of the job as a manger was to consolidate paperwork. the most enjoyable part was speaking to clients, and building relationships with their pets."
PetSmart,1d31qrlnt1ah8001,4.0,"During the day at the store you had many different areas to be aware of because of the variation of areas in the store.  There were live animals constantly in and out of the store, animals that were sold to be cared for, a groom shop, and vet clinic.  All of these areas had to be monitored to make sure they were all running safely."
PetSmart,1d30rrs340mcn000,5.0,My first retail position and wasn't sure how I would like it - but the manager and co-workers took me in and answered all my questions and made me feel like part of the team immediately.
PetSmart,1d30l6ggs1d07000,2.0,"When people first think of working for PetSmart they always think ""it must be fun to play with the animals"". Well yes, that part is true, but the con side of working with pets is some pets don't enjoy what you're trying to do to them so an occasional nip is bound to happen from either pet or owner."
PetSmart,1d30fksbm1ahn000,5.0,Marvelous atmosphere. Fair place to work. Equal opportunities. I would say it is a wonderful place to work all around and that if given the opportunity you should take it.
PetSmart,1d2vtrthc1ahn000,5.0,From the first day I felt welcomed. Everybody was willing to help me and show me what I needed to do. They were very understanding when I had questions and will miss all of them.
PetSmart,1d2vqanaa1d07000,2.0,"I loved my job. Working with animals is my passion and I planned on doing it for the rest of my life. I learn a lot working in the Grooming Salon at PetSmart. I learned how to train dogs, bath, and groom them. I also learned that management is horrible and even if they are wrong you are punished. My Grooming Manager was a person who did the bare minimum. She had a high turn over rate. She acted like she was friends with everyone then stab them in the back. She lied and fired anyone who became a better groomer then her. NEVER become a Groomer with this company. They train you wonderfully but its not worth the stress and pay."
PetSmart,1d2vm9akj1fdm000,4.0,"I've worked for two different PetSmart stores, and it can be a hit-or-miss with if you get a good manager or not. PetSmart typically gives good hours, and the employee discount is 15%, but only managers can become full-time (or groomers), at least from what I understand."
PetSmart,1d2v9qnnm1agn000,3.0,Too many tasks to get done without enough help - very stressful.
PetSmart,1d2v55kc91d0n000,4.0,"I worked at PetSmart part-time and it was a great side job for me. The people were professional, yet easy to work with and for. I would work here again. I only left because my son was born."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1d2uo2hdo0mt7000,1.0,Petsmart is stressful work place to work the management is terrible they do not  appreciate the work and time that you put in the company they always find a Reason to write you up for something you did or did not do it’s just a horrible place to work it and I wish I never work there  I don’t recommend no person to work or shop at Petsmart stores
PetSmart,1d2tukilb1ahn000,2.0,"Managers barely communicate with employees, but scold employees for lack of communication. It was common for them to assign several tasks at once and scold you for not getting them done fast enough. Evening shift was understaffed even though it was the busiest shift."
PetSmart,1d2tmqoov0mcn000,2.0,"Pay starts out terrible with a promise of 4 raises 3 months apart then yearly raises; I had to fight and fight to get just one while none of my co-workers ever saw one without promotion. Meanwhile management non stop gives you more and more to do; they are still piling new things on me weekly even a year and a half into the job. I'm doing the same amount of work as the petcare lead position while making $5 less. Too much cleaning up feces from all animals and having to attempt to respectfully gather a deceased animal after sickness or literally torn apart from being stressed with other animals. Customers treat you like garbage and question everything you tell them they're animal NEEDS because they think you're scamming them into buying stuff. Any customer that buys an animal will NOT research them so you must take 45 minutes out of doing the 100 tasks for the day to tell them what they have to buy, not make commission for the $300 you just made the store, then get yelled at for not getting all the tasks done. They wonder why there's an issue with people leaving after a month on the job."
PetSmart,1d2t78hlq1d16000,5.0,solving the needs of the customers on a daily basis. ensuring that all customers find what they need and have any problems solved. making sure the store is stoppable and organized.
PetSmart,1d2st7phs1d0n000,3.0,This was a great job to have when I was going through college because they always worked with my school schedule. It was also great to get an introduction into the animal world.
PetSmart,1d2shkvug1ahn000,2.0,Manager expected you to know how to do everything with little to no training involved. I had asked for more training which they never gave me. It was a very unprofessional work environment.
PetSmart,1d2qs64501ai7000,2.0,"so i started working at petsmart due to my love for animals. i loved the job and once i got really into it things came naturally although the management sucks, i complained multiple times about employees just to have my store leader write me up for not being a team player. managers could sit in the office or on the sales floor hours before being on the clock and never lifted a finger. i never got a vacation although i was there for over a year. customers stole all the time and nothing was done. management didn’t cate about anything unless it directly affected them. they all avoided confrontation. i would still have my job if all the managers weren’t 20 years old and all best friends. terrible place that i will never support again."
PetSmart,1d2oiksvm0kbn000,4.0,This was one of my favorite jobs I've had. I loved the freedom to be who you are and being surrounded by animals all day. I wish they had offered full time positions for new employees. It was a great environment with reasonable hours.
PetSmart,1d2o5vls81ba6000,3.0,"The most enjoyable thing about working at petsmart was meeting all the animals and different personalities. The position has very high turnover which makes climbing up in the company more difficult. You also must be able to work with feces, urine, slobber, vomit, hair, and other gross conditions as you are working with animals."
PetSmart,1d2negltn0mt6000,4.0,Working at PetSmart is just like working at any other retailer. Neverbhave weekends off unless requested in advance. Lots of times breaks are skipped.
PetSmart,1d2mqp1361ahm000,4.0,They bring in managers that don't know how to do the jobs there. Very strict policy. The mod is the worst place to work in the building. The provide food on Tuesday and Wednesday which was nice.
PetSmart,1d2lk2dd90mto000,5.0,I work in the grooming salon at my PetSmart. I am paid commission so my pay depends on business there and the amount of workload I can physically handle in an average workday. Although it is very stressful and physically demanding it is an enjoyable job. There are many policies in place that while I understand their need for safety reasons make my job and furthering what I do difficult at times. I do wish those in the salon work environment were consulted before these policies were put into place. I believe a collaboration between the salon employees and upper management would make those policies a bit more well thought through so not only would the safety of everyone always still be our main concern but also the work environment would be easier for those who work it.
PetSmart,1d2lg1f1a0mto000,2.0,I loved grooming dogs but the work environment was hostile leaving multiple people transferring to other locations which resulted in job losses because of poor management including HR.
PetSmart,1d2l5u0s21ah7000,4.0,"I loved knowing that when people came in with questions about products and services, that it really meant I was helping pets have/live better, healthier lives."
PetSmart,1d2l25mod1bg7000,4.0,Petsmart is an equal opportunity company that is a great place to gain experience working with animals. That being said it can be very fast paced and stressful on busy days. The management that I experienced at Petsmart was great because they are willing to work with you and are very understanding. There is also great opportunity for career advancement if you are willing to put in the time and work.
PetSmart,1d2kui47b0mt6000,2.0,"Poor management and stressful environment. Constantly being told what to do and never recognized for the good things you do. No matter how hard you try, it’s never good enough."
PetSmart,1d2kmf4cu1bg7000,1.0,Columbus oh groveprt dc was terrible they work you like a slave very heavy lifting at a fast pace i walked out during my shift some guys been there 15-20 years and was doing the same thing i was doing never advanced but all upper management was less then 8 years they dont promote within they are constantly over your back making sure you go faster and produce more orders like a overseer
PetSmart,1d2kln9bu1ah7000,3.0,"Great place , with good people but management  is always over your shoulder unless your a favorite.  Even if they like you,  if your not working every single day then you will slowly slip down in there eyes even if your using your own paid time off. If you work all the time and only take time off when they VTO then you can expect to advance."
PetSmart,1d2kjr1i51ai7000,1.0,I'm sure there are plenty of stores that are great to work at. If you love animals you would love petsmart . You can work with lots of different kinds of animals.
PetSmart,1d2jo9ve01ah7000,1.0,"Fun environment for animal lovers, lear mining about all animals, nutrition, care giving and training. Long hours and weekends a must. Paid time off with advanced notice"

PetSmart,1d2j6tdjv1ah7002,4.0,My immediately manager was always complaining about never wanting to be there and disliking her job while my bosses boss made it tolerable to work there and also my coworkers when they were not gossiping about others
PetSmart,1d2ipf8c51ah7001,4.0,petsmart is a great company to work for and management is easy going and very understanding. Working is fairly easy and does not require overtime even though it would never be a bad thing to work there for longer hours. Environment is great and there is never a bad day considering we work with dogs all day. weekends can become hectic but very manageable.
PetSmart,1d2ipelgp1ai7000,3.0,"Each store varries in it's own culture, depending on the managers and who works there. At my store in Crannberry, PA, mostly everyone genuinely is caring, passionate about animals and their welfare, works well as a team, and helps to create a possitive inviting atmosphere that has kept me there for over 3 years as an employee and makes me happy to go to work each day."
PetSmart,1d2illl6n0mt6000,4.0,the 2 years i worked there was very laid back with working the shifts and hours i wanted. The management was fantastic. the things i did learn about was all the different products for all the kinds of animals we carried with different store meetings and lectures.
PetSmart,1d2h46q6m1ah6000,2.0,"I was the jack of all trades. I was a dog trainer, worked petcare, cashier, bather & stocker all at the same time. You’d think raises would happen. They pay their employees very poorly. You have to move around from store to store for promotions. I’ve worked in two separate states for Petsmart and both places were just such a letdown. Management did all they could for me. It was Corporate. Their human resourses dept. is a joke. They don’t care about their lower employees at all. It shows in all the lawsuits from their employees."
PetSmart,1d2h0312s1d14000,4.0,"Must be a very people loving person. I grew to love people through tis job. The majority of the managers were very kind however one of them I am shocked that still works there. I had complained several times to management and no action was taken, instead of saying they would work with this manager they told me they had been working with said person for years now. Anyway the rest of the environment and coworkers are very pleasant to work with. The most challenging part of the job was growing comfortable enough to approach people and not take their bad days personally. the most enjoyable was caring for the animals, each animal has a personality and it was so fun to place them into the correct families."
PetSmart,1d2gsjkm01bg6000,4.0,I really enjoyed working for this company. I also enjoyed my time as a cashier and being able to help out PetParents in order to give them the best experience in finding all the products they were looking for to ensure the well being of their pet.
PetSmart,1d2gof3mr1ah6000,5.0,There is a easy and set routine at work that is very simple to follow and will make work go by smooth and fast. My co workers are fairly nice and cooperative and teamwork is the main skill that you need for this job.
PetSmart,1d2g331j00mt5000,4.0,Typically part-timers work between 4 to 6 hours a day and are able to get a day off as long as it's two weeks out. Very friendly and approachable managers that are there to assist you when needed. Simple job with reasonable pay.
PetSmart,1d2frkbog1ai6000,4.0,"IT's a fun place to work if you like animals. The environment is like most retail. The hours are the same, but depending on management your work/life balance and scheduling are usually horrible and not found out until the last minute."
PetSmart,1d2fp3jbu1agl000,5.0,new to company and from the outside it had been a great move for me.  I am challenged each day and trained on new procedures daily. I am happy I made the choice to come
PetSmart,1d2f176l41ai6000,5.0,"I would say that if you personally dont ,"
PetSmart,1d2e585lfak5k800,4.0,"Fast paced with a lot to do, coming into work & opening registers/counting safe, printing reports & adjusting inventory from previous sales that were negative to on-hand inventory. Working with many different types of individuals to get tasks completed & trying to make the job fun to do. Time Management: coming to & leaving work on time & doing as much as you can in the time that you have."
PetSmart,1d2e1b3ilaqhf800,5.0,"Being nice to people, communicating is key, ensure customer is satisfied. Good area to work. See different types of pets. Good staff and good managers."
PetSmart,1d2dufh6dak9l800,4.0,"Working in the PetsHotel is tedious after the holidays, I love all of my coworkers and all the furriends I’ve made there. My store manager is really cool and so is the PetsHotel manager, they’re very lenient on phones but don’t be on it too much."
PetSmart,1d2dqa3qob821801,3.0,Was overall a great environment just had poor management. the hardest part of the job was when you didn't have a solution to a customer's problem. Most enjoyable part was in the success of helping customers.
PetSmart,1d2dbpkt5aqhf800,5.0,"Working in the hotel was my favorite job I’ve ever had. I loved spending the days with the dogs, playing with them in camp and giving them little ice cream treats in the afternoons."
PetSmart,1d2d4u8qa52th800,5.0,"I loved working here and if given the chance i would love to go back. Great atmosphere, the employees are great and always know what they are talking about and always know the best way to help their customers."
PetSmart,1d2c3indob821800,4.0,Its a really relaxed work enviroment and the other groomers are awesome but you are constantly moving and working since you'll always have scheduled dogs and walk ins which can be stressful but since the dogs are nice and my coworkers are awesome i love it
PetSmart,1d2c0v2emb860800,4.0,"The animals are amazing, most of the customers are great, and the culture is lively and fun. Management focuses mostly on corporate numbers and less on the individual employees."

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1d2bv3r98akhd800,4.0,"My experience working here was generally positive, they start you out working as a cashier and gradually move you around upon request. The amount of hours you work per week fluctuates greatly even with open availability, little to no weekends off. I worked anywhere from 18-30 hours a week depending on scheduling. Staff were friendly and often times helpful when needed."
PetSmart,1d2bl0h3m5j5c800,2.0,"The only job I've had to go to HR for. Management is often abusive and makes the stores inhospitable, which is trickle down from the attitudes of higher ups. Hard work is not rewarded and they will bleed you dry if you are honest and accountable. Would not recommend, even if you like animals."
PetSmart,1d2bk40vrb821800,4.0,I loved the job wish I could go back got hurt to much but I would definitely go back as a floor person best job I have ever had plan to go back for sure
PetSmart,1d2ben5sab821800,3.0,I always enjoyed my job very much. Love working with the dogs. Appreciated the job security. Wasn't a lot of teamwork in the Grooming Salon. I didn't feel like upper management was on our side most of the time.
PetSmart,1d2b8ms8takdg800,5.0,"Fast paced, but fun work environment. Workplace culture was upstanding. Excellent grooming program. Great learning experience. Scheduled work shifts varied from day to day."
PetSmart,1d2b4qmnu5ncq801,3.0,It was a good place to work nice environment and nice people to work with and it was fun because of the competition that went on bout who can pull the most product before break
PetSmart,1d2b296r3ak9l800,4.0,"Come in when scheduled, about 10 to 5 mins early so you can check-in the dogs the has an appointment with you. Try to get all the dogs you have done as fast as safely possible including answering the phone and taking any walk-ins. Clean and makes calls in any free time you have. Deep cleaning every night if closing, the last hour you will be alone."
PetSmart,1d2950derakha800,3.0,"Long stressful days. Can be super tiring, you have to push yourself to get the numbers, if you don’t get the numbers your supposed to get, you get warnings before getting fired."
PetSmart,1d27td9r7akdd800,4.0,It was a fun experience. Customers are annoying but that is just retail. The hours can be early and the pay is average. I enjoyed my time though and it was a fair experience.
PetSmart,1d26v2r7f5j59800,4.0,"Always fun, the animals are the sweetest part. It can be a stressful environment when customers are unhappy. It can also get very tedious when waiting around."
PetSmart,1d26s3jc1b81u800,4.0,"I worked in the hotel and I loved everyone there. My manager and leaders were great, communicative, and understanding. I loved the dogs and they were the only reason I stayed a little longer than I planned. The management on the floor and our store manager, were not that great. I never worked directly with them, but I heard many complaints and gossip. Also just working in a corporate environment made it frustrating at times."
PetSmart,1d26dulb9brdo800,3.0,Willing to work with your schedule but does not pay well. The only positive I can think of is that they pay weekly and offer flexible hours. Management could always use improvement
PetSmart,1d26dn669brdo800,4.0,"Fast-paced job, have to be able to work under pressure and multi-task. Customer service skills needed. Friendly work environment. Have to be a team player and be able to work on you own."
PetSmart,1d265abvrb85t800,1.0,"Management would be more effective if they hired chimpanzees at half the cost. Didn't see a department manager for 4 hours on a 6 hour work day. No code for unprofessional language or scheduled breaks every 2 hours. Worked 8 days without taking a lunch. Lazy, inconsistent, uncaring, and incompetent."
PetSmart,1d23s4b7f5ncn800,4.0,Managers have been very helpful and are great people to work with. They have been the kind of people who you want to work hard for. However the more open availability the better chance for hours. They do not hire full time.
PetSmart,1d23bj73a52te800,5.0,They have great opportunities and many options available if you want to move up! The environment is wonderful ! They care about pets ! I loved working with petsmart they molded me into the person I am today !
PetSmart,1d232ufr7ak9i800,4.0,"My typical day would be to look over the store then to take the mop broom to clean up and dirt and pet hair off the floor prior to mopping or using the scrubber. After the floor was done, then i would clean the bathrooms, change out toilet paper and paper towels and mop the floors then I would proceed to clean the break room and mop the floor. I emptied all trash cans in the store and pur new trash bags in the trash cans and then took all the trash outside to the dumpster."
PetSmart,1d23029b1aqhc800,5.0,"Typically a day of work consisted of showing up at 5am, unloading pallets off the truck and setting them up in the backroom, taking pallets out of the backroom into the store and unloading the merchandise. I learned how to stock shelves in a timely fashion while keeping them organized. Management was decent, my only problem was that managers would keep quitting and new managers would join the staff regularly. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting, repeatedly lifting 50 pound bags of dog food gets pretty tiring after a while. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around my coworkers everyday."
PetSmart,1d22t0i115ncn800,4.0,Really great place to work.   Everyone was friendly and the customers for the most part were very easy to deal with.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1d22qi1iib81u800,4.0,"Advancing in PetSmart felt nearly impossible. I was a bather for over a year and every time I got close to being sent to grooming school, the management would somehow fall short on submitting my enrollment papers."
PetSmart,1d22c8fvp9r9f800,3.0,"The culture in Petsmart is nice. Employees and leaders are generally nice to be around. Working with animals is a joy, and the customers are nicer on average when compared to other retail environments. The only complaint is a big one however; Petsmart does not pay well."
PetSmart,1d21h4adrb89o800,4.0,"Working at  Petsmart was the best but low pay and a few hours isn't worth it. I had to apply for a second job, but Petsmart is nice job and very straight forwarded unless they threw you into petcare (like they did with me) without training you first or giving you a higher pay."
PetSmart,1d211djlhakdd800,4.0,"Good for some looking for a stable job and starting hands-on in the pet industry. I eventually had to leave because I wanted to go into Veterinary Nursing and needed to go to school full-time. Worked with some of the best people in the grooming business, but when old co workers moved on, work demanded more from me, but school was more important."
PetSmart,1d210g43s52te800,3.0,"This job is very physical and requires a lot of hard work. You learn as you go. When it gets busy you are expected to go fast pace and when it is slow you are expected to find something to do (clean, top stock, etc.) Do not work here if you think you just play with animals all day."
PetSmart,1d20u3denb85t800,4.0,My time at petsmart that is also not really gonna end soon has been a good one besides one manager that I have that has been a problem since before we transferred from another store to the same store. this manager has made other coworkers not want to work here and in turn they decided to leave simply because of how this manager was acting. I've had very few bad incidents with this manager but that's because she plays favorites.
PetSmart,1d20ov0qeb85t800,3.0,"I learned many and great skills while working here. From the animals out on the floor, to the dogs on my table. Petsmart really set the stage for me in my career. The hardest part of the job was management and select co-workers. It's hard to be in the grooming salon with a bunch of others without butting heads."
PetSmart,1d20lvr51akdd800,1.0,"Unfortunately Petsmart does not value its employees. Employees are treated as disposable and there is very little, relatively none at all, value for work/life balance, religious beliefs and the like. There is constant discord and management feels as if they can make any decision they choose without respect to the company handbook/policy. In fact, they will literally develop a new policy that contradicts a previous policy if it serves someone's individual purpose. EEO violations occur daily in its environment. Not recommended at all!"
PetSmart,1d208m5oqb81u800,3.0,It was a decent place to work at management there was okay did not have the answers sometimes the people there were helpful but constantly on the move
PetSmart,1d203692q5n9c800,5.0,"The dogs were very loud and the work was not easy, but the sense of accomplishment when all was said and done was well worth it.  Also the money was good and there were tips."
PetSmart,1d1upldbpak9b800,3.0,"Management and staff were nice, at first.  Then you notice the condescending and snarky tones in management. They tell you to ask a lot of questions so they can help but get an attitude when you do. Not to mention the bad mouthing of others by co workers in the salon. You are thrown into your position with very little training and talked down to instead of being guided. It’s very disappointing and makes for a very uncomfortable environment. I absolutely love the work I do but as I said, the environment makes it hard to focus and look forward to going into work. As for groomers, it is not the bathers job to wash your clients or steer away from our schedules and job duties, in any way, to accommodate you."
PetSmart,1d1ucgaf9as1c800,3.0,"Most of the time, we were understaffed and it made it stressful for certain positions to get their daily activities done. Also the management doesnt seem to care too much about the animal care as much as I expected."
PetSmart,1d1u5g7n3aqh6800,3.0,"It was hectic and the head cashier was verbally abusive ,  there were 4 managers and two were somewhat unpleasant. They only hire cashiers part time you have to wait for  full time cashier to quit to become full time."
PetSmart,1d1u3r2l1b85o800,5.0,A typical day. Expect to be warmly greeted by all leadership. Expect your managers to want to get to know you and be there to support you and your life. Expect to have opportunities for advancement. Expect your fellow associates to help you when you drop a pallet and to correct you on a process you may be doing wrong. Expect help and respect in all areas of the warehouse. The living wage is fair.
PetSmart,1d1u14pbj5j55800,3.0,I’ve worked with petsmart for about a year and from what I learned is that they tell you that you’re special they tell you you’re doing a great job but in reality they all talk about you behind your back for not doing the best job.
PetSmart,1d1tlc595aqh6800,4.0,I really liked working at Petsmart. The only complaint I have is that the last management I had inefficient.  All of the other managers I had with the company were great to work with.
PetSmart,1d1skjo31b89k800,4.0,it was ok place to work at unfair with who should be advanced people are overall nice and friendly but lack of hours and not much room to move up at all.
PetSmart,1d1sf2rv852t8800,2.0,It's honestly been to long since I've worked at this job. I loved the people that I worked with when I did work there. It was a nice place to work and paid okay for a college kid.
PetSmart,1d1s7vd4dak5c800,1.0,Petsmarts constant need to micromanage everything sucks the soul out of all their grooming salons.  Resistance is futile.  Take a look into the average salon.  A bunch of puppets on a string who aren't even allowed to have a DRINK AT THEIR TABLE.
PetSmart,1d1rrqvimaqh6800,4.0,steadily busy throughout your shift learned a lot of things about pet care there is always something that you can find to do great group of people to work with the only thing i feel like the training was not very detailed and did not help too much and coworkers seemed to get aggravated if u had to ask them for help..other than that i would say it was a decent place to work
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1d1rlt28552t8800,2.0,"Change of management, in particular an AGM, ruined the work environment and culture. This particular AGM was prejudice against associates that did not look like her. She went out of her way to treat associates badly and it was very apparent to everyone as to what was going on."
PetSmart,1d1r98t4b5ncj800,4.0,You are always on the move trying to balance taking care of customers and taking care of the animals. If you want to work in animal husbandry this is the place. It can be very stressful to get all tasks done.
PetSmart,1d1r2qsn0as1c800,4.0,Petsmart was a great place to work for. It's a fast place setting and there is always something to learn. You get to love in pets all day and work hard.
PetSmart,1d1r03m20aqh6800,4.0,Great place with great chances of promotion within. Owners of the company have changed hands so i worked in a different time for petsmart. I can only imagine what it is like now.
PetSmart,1d1quqn13ak5c800,4.0,"keep cutting hours, not doing the job you were hired for, managers do not seem to have time to get to know you, I learned that everything is timed, xxx"
PetSmart,1d1q2f9dub85o800,4.0,PetSmart is a great place to work with animals and to meet people who love animals as well. If you wish to work on servicing pets it is a great place to help establish yourself.
PetSmart,1d1p552ld5n97800,5.0,I learned so much while working for this company. I was given so many opportunities to grow and advance in my career that I had never had before. The team work mentality in the store I worked in was amazing. All managers functioned as a team and it made for an amazing environment to be in. I also loved helping pet parents out with their various needs and loving on all the pets coming into the store.
PetSmart,1d1oub1h45ncj800,3.0,"I’ve had a few experiences where the managers were not the best. They only care about themselves and their business and not their associates wellbeing. If you are having a problem, the managers do not really care about it unless it is effecting your capability to do your job and then they blame you. If you want a job where your manager actually cares about you and doesn’t put themselves first, I WOULD NOT recommend working at the Hudson location for PetSmart. They are extremely unfair and make promises that they do not fulfill."
PetSmart,1d1osu047b89k800,1.0,"If i could give this job a -100 i would. I feel like garbage every time i go, i am NEVER treated with respect. I use to cry every single time i go, and now im just numb to it. They really dont care about you unless you are a happy person 24/7.i hope to god a person who thinks about working there thinks twice because you will not like your life. Please save yourself do NOT work here."
PetSmart,1d1opilht5ncj800,4.0,This experience was fun and beneficial because it allowed me to play with animals while taking care of them. It also gave me experience in animal care.
PetSmart,1d1oitge552t8800,4.0,Shift started early giving plenty of time for personal life. Learned a great deal about pet products and the care of pets. The hardest part of the job was meeting time tables for trucks being unloaded and it was enjoyable working closely with pets.
PetSmart,1d1oh97pcakd7800,5.0,"Working at PetSmart was super fun, the employees are upbeat and the customers were always upbeat as well. Working with the animals and seeing people bring in their dogs was always fun. The pay isn't great, and it's hard to get full time."
PetSmart,1d1nljqjvb89h800,1.0,"It usually starts off with management. Very biased towards certain employees. Not very friendly nor collaborative when it is said that it is a team-oriented work environment. It is basically a sink or swim type of environment. Training is very minimal and does not train properly so you learn things as you go, which is not the best way to introduce employees who are new to taking care of pets professionally. Hours were cut despite the open availability."
PetSmart,1d1mfkhv5aqh1800,3.0,PetSmart is a fun place to work if you love animals. You are constantly helping out pet owners find the best products for there pets. the hardest part of the job is the rush periods and the slow times. the most enjoyable part was getting to see all the dogs and help pet owners find the best product for their pets.
PetSmart,1d1ia50hfaqh1800,3.0,"The management is horrible!! Forcing workers to continuously come into work even if they’re sick and at risk of getting everyone else there sick. Management talks and belittles you - picking favorites and letting things slide where they would micromanage someone else. It’s a toxic environment, petsmart should be focusing on watching their managers instead of shoving expensive dog/cat food down every customers throat. Employee discount at 15% off isn’t worth getting berated and looked down on every single day for 30+ hours a week."
PetSmart,1d1hnroa4akd3800,3.0,"Workplace culture just depends on what salon you work in. Ours isn't bad for the most part. Most of us girls get along swimmingly. The pay is hourly + commission. You have the opportunity to make decent pay...if you work very hard. If you feel like having a lazy week you will have a lazy paycheck. (I have been there for 4 years and only make just over 10 an hour). Full time benefits are not the greatest. The health insurance isn't great. You have two weeks of paid vacation until you hit 5 years and then it goes up from there. Management is abysmal, you're just a number cruncher sadly. It's a good starting point however, especially if you want a career in dog grooming. I can't say much about the store since I worked in the store for maybe 6 months."
PetSmart,1d1hcvhn2akh1800,3.0,"I started as a stocker and was trained to run the register, this was one of my first jobs out of High School and it really didn't feel like anyone cared what they were doing, just treating the job as a stepping stool to pay for what they needed until they could find a new job. In the 6 months I worked there before moving on, I went through 3 Store Managers and my direct Manager was switched 4 times."
PetSmart,1d1gvndmj52t5801,1.0,I would not refer anyone to work at petsmart they do not treat everyone equally an they have a tremendous turnover rate I worked at petsmart distribution for a little over seven years this is by far the worst company I have ever worked for
PetSmart,1d1fnkn6o52t5800,1.0,Let's cut to the chase. You only work here because you really enjoy pets. If you know nothing of pets. DO NOT WORK HERE! They say the most important thing is treating the pet parents with respect. Which that's easy... No brainer! They promise to teach you about the products. They teach you nothing! You have to figure it out on your own. Some of the manager's need to stop messing around with their employees and disrespecting them and actually treat them nice if they want the same in return.
PetSmart,1d1fiiu4aakh1800,5.0,"I absolutely love this job! I wish I could go back, but I already left twice due to school. Got offered an assistant manager position, but had to turn down because I would not have had the time. Balancing full tie school and full time job is hectic."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1d1f2sb05akh1800,4.0,would stay at job I like it a lot just need more hours to pay bills. they cater to management when it comes to hours the shifts are too short for cashiers.
PetSmart,1d1ehioh4b89h800,5.0,"a typical day is slow and helping customers (depending on the day) with concerns they may have for their pet or a pet they want. i've learned a lot about different kinds of animals while working here (ex: feeding snakes once a week, reptiles can't have tap water without reptisafe)"
PetSmart,1d1e3s1th0mtu000,1.0,The people who work here show that they do not truly care for the animals because the cleaning and feeding schedules are not followed properly leaving the animals without food and with soiled bedding. Then when you bring up these issues to a manager they get upset. I tried to help improve their methods but was only met with hostility. NEVER work here.
PetSmart,1d1djkrc452t5800,1.0,"I applied for a certain position and they promise you things. After a week there they started changing things. All they do is lie to you and stab you in the back and talk behind your back. They make you do things you weren’t hired for and not comfortable with. Not only that, I was being harassed by the managers also. They don’t even care about there employees and even the customers."
PetSmart,1d1dgsnsgb81m800,4.0,This job was very easy and slow paced. They don't need many people working unless it's the holidays. Management is excellent they always have your back when you need help. People who work here are usually very nice and love animals. The hardest thing about working here is learning how to take care of all the animals. The best part about working here is getting to work with animals and people like to bring their dogs.
PetSmart,1d1d0gb3oakd3800,5.0,"It requires a person who is focused, cares about what they're doing, and is okay with getting a little dirty sometimes. I personally worked in the hotel, and the management was fun, understand, caring, kind and obviously passionate about what they were doing. The customers are grateful for the help you give, and you get the sense of feeling good for truly doing something beneficial. Wonderful place to work!"
PetSmart,1d1c9h7ao52t5800,5.0,Petsmart is a very busy place and is always nonstop.  It is very rewarding as well and has lots of opportunities for advancement and promotions.  I would highly recommend!!!
PetSmart,1d1beldn4as17801,1.0,Never respected and never acknowledged for work.
PetSmart,1d1a516n1aqh0800,3.0,"Busy work days depending on the season. When it was busy expected to do a lot, when it was slow expected to pick up other work around the store even if it wasn't included in our job description. Never got help from other department even tjou grooming department was expected to provide help. Management appreciated the grooming department when profitable and productive but wasn't influential when profits were low."
PetSmart,1d19u5va9b81l800,4.0,"Fun, clean please to work with nice team members. Quality animals and products. Grooming, adoptions and veterinarian services also offered. Large selection with competitive pricing."
PetSmart,1d1991ps4ak95800,1.0,I was one of the most successful managers in out district! But they wore me down with too many hours. not enough pay and no support! My numbers were the kind EVERY manager wanted to see!! You guys lost an amazing and dedicated manager!
PetSmart,1d195f3qcbrdg800,1.0,"That's right, you are unqualified to work for Petsmart if you smoke medical marijuana at home.  What a disgrace!  I hope nobody works for and encourages such foolish behavior on this company's part."
PetSmart,1d17t57ecb89g800,3.0,"I enjoyed my experience working with other clients pets, but I struggled with some of my employees. They were not always appropriate at times, but I knew it was a temporary job for the time."
PetSmart,1d16u1s2i5n8u800,4.0,"I grew pretty high and quickly, but email captures, ensuring everyone walking in buys something, and selling puppy kits kinda sucked."
PetSmart,1d15h302sakgr800,3.0,"This was a great job for a while. But not something sustainable for long-term unless you suffer with no benefits and low income until the positions open. Even with commission and hourly pay, you will only be offered part-time at certain locations. Management is unstable and there is an obvious power struggle within this particular location. God forbid you decide to leave this job. You will be treated like a criminal by certain management members. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the stress created from lack of communication, and also a very unsteady schedule that disrupts the flow of operations."
PetSmart,1d14vcu5naqgr800,3.0,This job really teaches you what its like to work in retail. I learned many things while working there while i didn't have the best coworkers or managers.
PetSmart,1d149fomhakct801,1.0,"The particular PetSmart I worked at had very poor management, very low care for the pets. Staff was not concerned with sick animals or showed any care for them."
PetSmart,1d12qilu0ak51800,2.0,"In the four years I worked for PetSmart, I had 5 different store managers. So many things got swept under the rug, like performance reviews and raises. Not ok! I was promised multiple raises that I never saw and the work hours were unreliable at best. Managers didn't take responsibility when things went badly and tried to blame lower employees. Overall, terrible company to work for."
PetSmart,1d12frcivak90800,4.0,"Petsmart was my first job I loved it. The animals, the training, everything. But as all work places there are people who get special treatment and I don’t put up with unfair treatment."
PetSmart,1d11piu5fas11800,4.0,A typical day includes doing about 5 dogs a day. management was great and always very helpful when you had a problem.

PetSmart,1d1187esf52sv800,4.0,i had the positon after graduating college in 2008.  It was a great opportunity to learn managment skills.  the work was enjoyable with little stress.
PetSmart,1d10k88tjas11800,3.0,It’s a good company for those who know how to groom fast in the short amount of time. For a part-time groomers they work with your schedule to help accommodate you if you go to school or if you have children.
PetSmart,1d0um7am152sv800,5.0,"I really liked my time with the pets hotel. I made great friends and the manager always made sure everyone was happy and comfortable. The environment was always great and the pets always made it a fun time, I don't think I ever had a dull moment."
PetSmart,1d0thh3c0brdb800,3.0,"I love working at PetSmart the management and associates are great, it is fun work environment being around animals. Seeing all the animals everyday is the best part."
PetSmart,1d0t0sitfbrdb800,1.0,"This used to be a positive nice place to work and I would have recommended it to anyone.  Over the last year that has drastically changed.  In fact there are a lot of people at the call center (pets hotel) that have been fired, quit or are currently seeking other employment.  The turnover is tremendous so therefore they are frequently hiring.  So many people are on ""warnings"" for one reason or another.  Overall it has become a very negative place to work and as a current employee (looking for other employment) I highly recommend looking for employment somewhere else.  The management is poor overall.  They cant make up their minds (probably due to lack of experience and incompetence) as to how to run the call center..so everything is CONSTANTLY changing.  Overall poor communication.  The ""quality"" dept (they monitor your calls) is the WORST I have ever experienced and the training dept is lacking too.  Systems are obsolete. They also add responsibilities with no increase in pay. Goals/metrics are unrealistic and makes the job quite stressful..which is ridiculous.  We are making reservations for a pet to board at one of their ""hotels"". You would think it would be a relaxed environment as it should be.  Nope.  Sadly, I could go on and on..bottom line: look elsewhere unless you are desperate and then still continue to look."
PetSmart,1d0t0kgs95n8u800,1.0,"This company is ran by people in corporate that have no idea what goes into working or operating a grooming salon. While the salon brings in the most money for the store, they treat their salon employees nothing. They have unrealistic expectations for their salon workers as well, in the form or bogus sales contests that promise a reward but no follow through."
PetSmart,1d0qa9ph8b89b800,1.0,"I was hired as someone who would transfer to animal care because I prefer working with animals, not people. Knowing full well I have anxiety, they stuck me in cashering instead. Not only that but they CUT my hours one week in and after I quit, they did not pay me my full hours I worked. The cherry on top was all the dead animal returns people brought to the counter demanding refunds on poor animals who didnt have a chance because of poor care at Petsmart. I will never support this company again. Shameful!"
PetSmart,1d0pspdunb85f800,4.0,I sat with the team I supported which had be separated from my own team.  This made it more difficult to interact with my team to get feedback on work I was doing.
PetSmart,1d0pahh48as11800,4.0,Could be managed better in disciplinary aspects and because the behavioral system is flawed. No one can plan to be sick however can not use sick days without planning them. Not fair
PetSmart,1d0otkkfnbrdb800,1.0,Unless you like working TWO jobs to advance your life this is not the place for you.
PetSmart,1d0o86pgb1fdv000,1.0,"relatively slow paced and not very much pressure. Handling animals was the most enjoyable part, but the hardest was the allergies. Learned to communicate and work well in a team based environment."
PetSmart,1d0o7jqb01ahv000,4.0,Great learning experiences and time management. As part time schedules are inconsistent but management will work with personal schedules. If you love pets this place is for you.

PetSmart,1d0lfd2v71ahv000,3.0,"Petsmart was a cool place to work.  My only issues were the lackof help, and every few weeks there was a new thing to push sales which puts a lot of pressure on the employees.  Management comes down on employees for not meeting goals, but they don't do as much as the cashiers, and petcare."

PetSmart,1d0jddtom1d1f000,4.0,I love the job but the management in my department is very unprofessional. All their communication with employees is done through text message including sending out the work schedule. Which was given out the evening before the week starts.

PetSmart,1d0del6kd1ahe000,4.0,Great company to work for if you love animals. Its fast paced but lots of fun. You are always busy weather its with customers or tasks. Staff and managers are awesome. And you get a discount.
PetSmart,1d0db4t1j1fdv000,3.0,"over time, as our management changed, the culture just got worse. especially with the merging of job titles and responsibility, never-ending decreases in labor hours for the team, and ever increasing number of tasks handed down from corporate. In reality, corporate is drowning their management team slowly, things roll downhill so naturally stress rolls over onto even part time associates causing all decent workers to flee. tack on the basic realities of customer service and you have an insufferable work environment."
PetSmart,1d0cvd6500kbv000,4.0,"I really enjoyed my time with PetSmart. The customers and their pets were awesome. The employees were awesome to work with too. It's just very difficult to keep everything maintained and all systems running if you are a non-salaried manager. And you are not given many hours to keep the store staffed either. Otherwise, I would recommend PetSmart any day as a great place to work!"
PetSmart,1d0cq4p2d1agu000,3.0,The Work place is very un organized  no communication  between the managers   And there is never enough employees  working to satisfy the amount of customers on any given day  the employees don’t care about their job but management and employees get along great together everyone is very nice to work with but can tell ninety percent don’t like their job to much work for such little pay

PetSmart,1d0bn0p770kbv000,3.0,I started as a cashier then moved on to a stocker. I ended my employment as a groomer. I enjoyed most of my time at petsmart. The benefits were great and i enjoyed my job.
PetSmart,1d0bld3h11d1f000,4.0,"We have the opportunity to greet every pet and help their pet partners get the right solutions for all their pets needs.  Lots of time to educate pet Parents and get to know the pets.  Offer great products.  Our discount is second to none. 50% off proprietary brand dog and cat food every day, plus a free 6 week training course for our own dog."
PetSmart,1d0bkq8o21d1f000,5.0,This job is great for animal lovers and people who would rather take car of dogs and cats then serving food or being a cashier and this is the best job I’ve had yet.
PetSmart,1d0bjgdlc1d0v000,1.0,"Very stressful work day, strict management, I learned that I hate retail. Some friendly people, but very few. Hardest part is being stuck on register all shift long. Only good part was the few friends I made."
PetSmart,1d0bje3bqb80h800,5.0,"A typical day at work consists of taking care of all the animals in the store, that means feeding, cleaning, and caring for their overall health while maintaining excellent customer service. This type of work environment really teaches you to value all the animal species in the store, and that there's always an opportunity to learn something new. The management and all other associates are always willing to guide you if you have any doubts. It's really an excellent work environment for any pet lover and for students that love animals."
PetSmart,1d0bj22i51fdv000,4.0,"working at Petsmart is a good experience. the organization is passionate about pets, however, there is more they could do for their employees. they don't go out their way to help the people who work for them."
PetSmart,1d0bhvg4p1bad000,4.0,"The family you establish within the store is probably the greatest highlight of working at PetSmart (besides the animals, of course). It's a small enough store that you get to work closely with everyone, and the people hired are typically very personable. Customers are usually pleasantly sociable and shop frequently enough to build a relationship with as well."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1d0as6slm1fdv000,4.0,"Petsmart was fun because of all the dogs you got to meet. Being a dog bather I had to learn time management, and it was also satisfying to help dogs stay clean and cute."
PetSmart,1d0an5v3i5nch800,5.0,"Job itself was amazing, management was amazing and cash registers were the easiest ones I've ever used. Easy to learn. Enjoyed working there very much..."
PetSmart,1d0al7kk7b80h800,4.0,"I loved this job, although when the new store manager took over he picked favorites and started cleaning house immediately and let go of employees for no reason and wasn't the most gentlemanly man out their. favors the women."
PetSmart,1d0agst191fdv000,3.0,"Some days were better than others, but this is typical of work in customer service settings. Not a good place to work long term, but in the short term it is fine."
PetSmart,1d0a3uf4h1ahv000,4.0,"Good place to work as a dog bather. I've gained many skills in dog handling and customer service. A typical day for a bather involves checking dogs in and out, and discussing service options with the pet parents; and then bathing, drying, and brushing the dog, trimming and/or grinding their nails, and sometimes teeth brushing and paw pad and sanitary area trims. The salary is not great, but is good for a part-time job."
PetSmart,1d094ngld1d0v000,3.0,I loved working at persmart we were like onr big happy family and we all got along hours were not consistent to live off of but i stuck it out for 10.5 years.
PetSmart,1d08qrfle0mtf000,1.0,"There was no way to find out my schedule in advance each week because the manager would write it on a piece of paper and post it on a bulletin board. Not only that, but she would schedule me outside my hours of availability, and purposely change the schedule last-minute so we didn't know when to show up. It's not bad working in the Pets Hotel when there are just a few dogs, but when you get more than 6 or 7, you see the nastiest things."
PetSmart,1d08deaoo1ahe000,5.0,"Life at PetSmart means believing every pet deserves a holiday present! This holiday season, pet parents and associates at PetSmart have donated more than a million stuffed animals across North America for donations to local pet adoption agencies."
PetSmart,1d081duc01d1f000,4.0,"People who love working with animals, this is a good place too be. It’s great and very fast paced and can be stressful but it’s a good work environment."
PetSmart,1d06plski0kbv000,4.0,"Overall, the work environment is fair. Staff is friendly overall, its the corporation itself that could use some work.  Often times, Groomers are treated like robots and are expected to dish out 8-10 dogs in a short time span with only given half the pay of their hard work."
PetSmart,1d06i3ltj1agu000,5.0,"Gives you a chance to see new things everyday. Such as dogs, cats, lizards, etc. I had two roles at this job a cashier and I also worked in the grooming salon as a bather. This job was amazing and the staff was great I love them so much."
PetSmart,1d067s6gu1ahv000,3.0,I loved and treasured the people that I worked with. these are great folks that work very hard to give their 100 percent at all times. too bad that it wasn't recognized.
PetSmart,1d0602obn0kbv000,5.0,"I was a pet care specialist so a typical day is coming in and spot cleaning cages, administering medications to animals in the sick room if needed, giving all animals fresh food and water, spot cleaning and depending on the day- a complete cleaning which means replacing liter in all cages on said day (i.e Mondays were bird change outs so i gave everyone new food, water, litter and cleaned all decorations/toys they had in their cage). I learned a lot about animals working there and it was the best thing for me because it encouraged me to have pets of my own. Management was terrific. I loved everyone I worked with. The workplace itself was good. Store traffic was always low-medium, even during the holidays. The hardest part of my job was getting too attached to animals. I hated selling my favorite animals i bonded with. The most enjoyable part was taking care and being with the animals. They always made me feel happy."
PetSmart,1d05v18fg1d0v000,4.0,"I think PetSmart is a great place to work if you are between jobs, need a second job or in school.  If you're wanting to promote within the company, just let them know during the interview process and again at least 2 months later."
PetSmart,1d054dtko1agu000,3.0,They don't provide the assistance needed by their cashiers when there are too many customers for one person to handle; management was not there to help when needed.
PetSmart,1d02t553s1fdv000,3.0,"Advancement is difficult because management find their spot and never move again, in turn the company has a 5 year role that they try and find a way to fire you if you haven't advanced. Pay is minimum wage, so you better have a roommate to pick up the rest of rent and/or other house bills/luxury goods."
PetSmart,1d02g6hgv0kbv000,5.0,"My responsibilities working at PetSmart as retail agent, was stocking shelves and organize the isles, sweeping and moping, serve customers by helping them bring their groceries to their vehicles and answering customer's questions in regards to animals or products."
PetSmart,1d01gsl6ib80h800,1.0,Manager do absolutely nothing. The associates carry the company on their back. Safety within the work place is neglected and definitely not taken seriously in the petshotel.
PetSmart,1d013p4jd1bad001,3.0,Hardest part of my job was getting people to do there job. Sounds simple. My last year the company went to self reporting style system. Associates would use this to get out of their responsibilities. This made my ability to do administrative paperwork difficult because to often I was picking up the slack.
PetSmart,1d00n0oeh0mcv000,4.0,I love working here. Due to the location we do not get a lot of business so getting hours at the store is limited so I need to make more else where. Getting hired is easy which makes it hard on me because not everyone completes their tasks and then leaves the next employee to clean up after them. This is what makes the day fast paced because you have limited time to get daily responsibilities done. There are several employees who I believe should be fired but management does nothing about the lack of work on others behalf. I get along with all of the employees wonderfully. We are very close knit and have a sarcastic humor among all of us.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1cvv22pn0b80h800,3.0,"The company is great to work for in many ways. Getting to be around animals was a big plus for me. They also offer decent benefits. However, in the last few years the support from the Phoenix home office has declined. There is very poor communication from corporate to the store level and training programs have been cut. They have also cut labor down to a level that makes it nearly impossible to run the store."
PetSmart,1cvtrgirc1aie000,3.0,You have to love animals and bave to open to having defferent roles and be open to what they ask you to do. The people will alsways make quite the difference.
PetSmart,1cvrobrk01fdv000,1.0,"PetSmart's mission is to ""...bring pet parents closer to their pets so they can live more fulfilled lives"" but they do not demonstrate this for the overworked staff. From their stocking team, to cashiers, to groomers to upper management, this company does not show compassion for the lives of the people they hire.  Many times, I had my hands tied behind my back with a team who lacked respect for their manager and targeted me for my lack of understanding for the company.  I was not given sufficient training.  As an employee from PetSmart, you can expect rude managers who are not empathetic to your life outside of work and the workplace culture is very immature.  From gossip to backtalk to blatant disrespect, it was hard to develop a positive culture."
PetSmart,1cvrmfhu41fdv000,2.0,this is more of a high school job. they don't pay much. the hours were not consistent. the people I worked with were fine. the store manager was the worst store manager I ever had.
PetSmart,1cvr2fdi45nch800,4.0,"Great team in the salon and hotel very good at keeping up with walk in services and willing to lend a hand to other associates in need. Very busy during peak times and season. Customers could be very rude due to area, but was overall great. Sad to leave."
PetSmart,1cvr1rje01ahe000,4.0,Once familiarized with the inner working of the place you fit right in. The staff are very friendly along with customers who frequent the place weekly.
PetSmart,1cvqvtpn0b80h800,3.0,I love this job. It keeps me busy and I like that. I love helping customers in general. I’m well at multitasking and making sure the job gets completed. I also make sure the store is opening ready.
PetSmart,1cvpjlieb1aie000,3.0,"My time at petsmart was a rollercoaster. I worked very hard for 3 years and loved taking care of the animals in store. But it's hard to move up in that company unless you know someone. Like any retail store, it gets very crazy and stressful."
PetSmart,1cvp3k8qa1ahe000,2.0,Petsmart's managers are not willing to assist you with customers around the store. spends most of their time in their office  if Clarence isnt coming.
PetSmart,1cvovjlij1ahe000,5.0,I really enjoy helping people find new pet and helping them take care of them and showing them what they can do better to help care for their new pet.
PetSmart,1cvoe4aff1ahv000,3.0,"The store I worked for had poor management, horrible scheduling, and a huge lack of teamwork. I came in to my position hopeful and happy to work with the animals, but most of my other employees did not have their best interest in mind. However, I was able to spend some time at another store in the area in order to fill some hours, and they were absolutely wonderful. The management was understanding and willing to work with you, the other employees formed a wonderful team, and the health of the animals was at the forefront of the group's concern. I guess it depends on the store you wind up at."
PetSmart,1cvnf45hf1d1f000,2.0,"Overall the job itself isn’t bad. There are worse places to work. If you’re a teenage animal lover with a flexible schedule who doesn’t mind working weekends it could be ideal. If you’re over 30 and just need a few hours to supplement your income, not so great. If you have a specific number of hours you’re available to work this job probably won’t meet your needs. They will either try to put you on a full time schedule or cut you back so much that you’re forced to either quit or find additional employment. It’s a great first job for a kid right out of high school. For a parent just trying to pay the rent it’s not worth the trouble."
PetSmart,1cvmjsas40mcv000,5.0,"Working for petsmart was wonderful, i loved working with the animals and helping out the customers with their questions. My favorite aspect of working there was seeing peoples faces after i helped them with a certain type of animal, especially the fish."
PetSmart,1cvmd14kn1fdv000,2.0,"if you want to be a groomer it's great, but corporate doesn't value you and half the time the managers don't either. It's all about money. They don't care as long as you can do a minimum of 5 dogs a day, which is a step up from 4 a day. Military discounts are now taken from our commission instead of a coupon we would give to the customers which wouldn't effect our pay at all. Petsmart upped grooming prices but in the end the groomers are still losing more money than we ever had before. If you wanna be a groomer, be part time, unless you need benefits."
PetSmart,1cvm2f6940mtf000,4.0,"if you love seeing pets,great. retail can be hard,but just for a part time place to work its not bad at all. anyone would want more money but they are fair for retail."
PetSmart,1cvm1k8a21ahv000,4.0,I thought it was a great place to work while in college. The store manager was a fun guy to work for. They are also flexible with your hours while in school.
PetSmart,1cvljhs1q1d1f000,3.0,"I would check the appointments for the day. Prepare the salon and my work space, prep shampoo system, check in my clients, bathe and groom the pets, check out my clients, manage walk in services, and print out my end of the day paperwork."
PetSmart,1cvk0a6ru1d0v000,4.0,The job requires a set schedule in order to complete the daily tasks but the pay is fair and they offer health care for full time employees.
PetSmart,1cvjo5g031ahe000,3.0,"I did not feel like i was doing much on the job. I wanted to be able to help around more, but i do not believe that i was there long enough to  be of any use"
PetSmart,1cveupk4l0mcv000,2.0,"This place is just depressing to work at. The coworkers are rude and in some instances just mean to each other and the animals, a dog screaming about a nail grind isn’t in the dogs best interest it’s in the companies and the groomer who is getting g paid for its best interest"
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1cuvb2eem1agl000,5.0,"All depends on store, but overall a nice place to work. My store had amazing management, everyone was helping everyone, no fend for self mentality. We all worked together to drive sales and hit the Mark's that we needed to (or were aiming to) hit."
PetSmart,1cuugt7e21agl000,5.0,I loved it. If your not a runner then its not for you. You are your own boss. You get to choose how much money you want to make daily. And the bonuses are the best
PetSmart,1cutdibvv1bg6000,4.0,"I absolutely LOVED my first store. Management was responible and punctual. I advanced fast in the company, and needed to relocate to train people who wanted to listen to me. New store has terrible management. Rude and full of attitude. There are nice people in the haystack, but yeah."
PetSmart,1custso1m1ahl000,4.0,A great company to work for. Easy to work at other stores to pick up hours. Very flexible schedules. I loved learning other positions in the store. I loved helping guests
PetSmart,1cunet5lq1fdl000,3.0,Relaxed yet fast-paced environment. All employees are professional and easy to talk to.  No issues with team dynamics.  Excellent quality of work with a non-enterprise view of data.
PetSmart,1cumrh23c1ah6000,4.0,its great to see all the different dogs come in   some come for just a visit or salon appointment or training.  its a very interactive place between customers and employees and a very soothing place to be employed
PetSmart,1cumqokmn1agl000,4.0,"Petsmart was great place to work if you love pets. Great atmosphere ,Love the people i worked with,learned a lot about animals,fish.And running a store."
PetSmart,1cump3vln1ba4000,3.0,A typical day at work is just standing at the register until it starts to slow down. Then emptying garbage and making sure all returns are in the cart for the closing shift. I've learned how to use a register and how to deal with day to day customers. Management is kind of all over the place at PetSmart there's always two on during each shift and they're doing multiple things. The hardest part of this job is standing through the whole shift. The only time you're able to sit is if you have a break of any kind of when you use the bathroom. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting all the customers and their pets as well as some of my coworkers.
PetSmart,1culqjo1j1ahl000,5.0,It is a great place to learn and engage with people and pets who care about the same things you do. Career advancement is always possible with hard work and knowledge.
PetSmart,1culjfof11d06000,5.0,I was a cashier I would stock and clean and face the store. Also would interact with customers and their pets and do cleanup duties around the store before closing time.
PetSmart,1culc9mtn0kbn000,3.0,"The workers at PetSmart are very friendly and are always doing their jobs.  I feel that they are very knowledgeable in their own areas of expertise; Banfield, Hotel, Petcare, Grooming, Cashiers.   I feel that management in some departments are less willing to help, but quickly try to find fault, or not willing to really help the employee ( which is part of Managements job)"
PetSmart,1cukohhtl0mto000,2.0,"The company doesnt stand behind their employees, customers are allowed to treat the employees terribly and constantly get free things for complaining. Commission based groomers get customers discounts taken out of their checks (senior and military discounts and any special going on)."
PetSmart,1cukjvrc41ai6000,5.0,"I love everything about this job, I'm working with animals all day, playing with the animals making sure they are safe and loved on. I learned more about which dogs have to wear harnesses and which dogs are optional with the harness. I've learned more about signs of stress in animals. Over all a great place to work at , great co-workers, great managment, very great working environment"
PetSmart,1cukigkhk1d0l000,2.0,"terrible management... inconsistent scheduling... aggressive and incompetent store manager... consider this location only if absolutely necessary. think about gas station work before a position with this company in las vegas, NV"
PetSmart,1cuk8rbev1ah6000,4.0,I liked working at Petsmart mainly because I'm an animal lover and got to work with animals all day.  The pay isn't very good at all. Every day was different. It's a very busy environment and can stressful at times.
PetSmart,1cuj0aed51ah1000,2.0,They will bark you down when they get yelled at by corporate and sometimes the tasks are tedious and there is no way to defend yourself when customers accuse you of something you did not do. They lack empathy towards workers and open door policy is a joke. they are not leaders just over paid cashiers and stockers.
PetSmart,1cuitigt31ahh000,3.0,Enjoyable work with animals however there is lack of advancement opportunities. After applying twice for a salon leader position but passed over it was made clear that it is not what you know or degrees you possess but who you know.
PetSmart,1cuhis9731fdi000,5.0,Used forklift to stock store and unload truck pallets they have very nice people working thier I love their grooming and training station plus their all linked to one another

PetSmart,1cufdhsr7b80i800,4.0,The environment at Petsmart is great. I loved being around animals all the time. Most customers were nice and it was overall a positive workplace. I think is a great part time job and a good job to have if you want to learn more about pets.
PetSmart,1cuf5ajg71d10000,2.0,"poor managment, no support from management, its a place where if there is promblem people turn the other way, dont do anything about it. and them point fingers."
PetSmart,1cudlacre5j7o800,2.0,"This is a good job to have while you are in high school or just graduated from high school or you want to move up in the company as a manager. Just being a cashier or an associate will not benefit you in the long run even if you are full time. They do not give you a raise annually like they initially tell you. Then a lot of the times employees quit or stop showing up to work, which means hiring new staff all the time. The store I worked at was always losing employees and hiring new ones. I was there for almost 5 years, I never got a raise and I worked hard because we were always short staffed."
PetSmart,1cudiokt7akj2800,4.0,"My time at petsmart was cut short due to personal reasons, when I put in my 2 weeks the management was more then understanding and tried to work with me to see if my circumstances would change. In which they gave me a months leave to see if I would be able to get the help I need to care for my daughter."
PetSmart,1cucuqvm3akbu800,4.0,Worked this job as an additional part time job after my full time vet tech job. I can work anywhere in these stores with my back ground. Like talking to people about there animals
PetSmart,1cucqamhf0mtn000,3.0,Productive and fun workplace. Only negative was not much Advancement opportunities. I would recommend a friend or family member to work here in the future.
PetSmart,1cucl366j0mtn000,5.0,"I got to take care of the dogs and cats that were being boarded there. I was responsible for the check-in and maintaining cleanliness of the cages. We had play rooms for them to play in and took them on walks for exercise. Some dogs were nice and others not so much. Overall, I loved animals and how everyone worked together"
PetSmart,1cucc9oh1akf3800,5.0,"Loved the customers I had the pleasure to encounter every day at work. My co-workers. Managers made it a fun, energetic environment.  Enjoyed the hands-on quality of the job."
PetSmart,1cuaf83slakj2800,2.0,"The pay is decent and the benefits ok. The management will not respect your availability; the will schedule you when you say you cannot work, and it is up to you to cover your shift then. No chance of promotion. I was promised one 2 years ago, and every time it opened up (which was a lot) they hired someone externally, or promoted someone whom they admitted wasn't as good as me. Only work here if you are desperate and won't be here long."
PetSmart,1cua85br4b80i800,4.0,Both managers I had while working for PetSmart were awful. Extremely bossy and talked to us in a demeaning tone. Loved my coworkers and meeting all the customers but I left specifically because of the management and because I was only getting about 5 hours a WEEK
PetSmart,1cua24alg0mt7000,4.0,I started as a petcare associate and soon after trained to be a dog trainer. They pay for you schooling and the trainer I was taught by was very helpful in making me a great trainer
PetSmart,1cu9urmqbakj2800,3.0,Clean and mostly nice. Good clients and steady flow. Working with so many people became hard because people were fighting over grooms and stealing appointments
PetSmart,1cu85bssc1d0u000,4.0,Its a great place to work. I started working as a revualr associate and then got promoted rigbt away. So hard work pays off there and they recognize and appreciate it.

PetSmart,1cu4uukomakf3800,4.0,"The best part of working with the pets is that you can see how happy someone is when you help them find the right ""pet"" for their lifestyle.

PetSmart,1cu20id7maqj9800,5.0,"I started as a pet care employee at PetSmart. I learned to take care of the birds, fish, reptiles, and small animals, as well as the customers. I then learned to train dogs. It is a great company with great values, I just had a bad experience at my store with a manager that is no longer with the company."
PetSmart,1ctvtmua70mtm000,3.0,"It was a good experience until, most employees never showed for work. I personally wish they could have let me learn more animal care because of what I wanted to learn and be as a growing associate."
PetSmart,1ctvorn13akj1800,4.0,"I came into Pet Smart as a full-time associate. After 2 years, I was promoted to Warehouse/Stocking Manager and I greatly enjoyed this position.

PetSmart,1ctvojprr0kbo000,3.0,"This job had little room for advancement and promotions were a joke. Aside from that I enjoyed learning and ultimately guiding people in a solid direction when it comes to the wellbeing of their pets. I played the role off a salesman... being informative and accurate in my advise and suggestions, while making no commission. It was a learning experience that has helped me in my life after the job."
PetSmart,1ctvnb940as3c800,4.0,"Worked here while going to school. Fun place to work, but moving up in the company is really difficult, as there are really not that many open spots, and there is no policy to promote from within."
PetSmart,1ctuevhefb80h800,5.0,"Great environment to work in, very friendly, helpful, and inviting. I called off only one day out of the time I worked there, because of a family emergency, and they were absolutely understanding about it. I made the day up on one of the days I didn't normally work."
PetSmart,1ctu8iqsebrfu800,4.0,good chances to move up and learn but lots of turnover and instability.  Promises were made and broken frequently.  The staff can be amazing but often problems are oevrlooked if they are friends with the store manager
PetSmart,1cttto3ui0mt5000,4.0,A good place to work for groomers. Can be a bit stressful with all the other required task that have nothing to do with grooming though. The pay is great if you can groom 5 plus dogs per day.
PetSmart,1ctts34h81agi001,4.0,"Great place to work! Upbeat environment and so much room to grow, especially if you wish to climb the corporate ladder. Highly recommend working here if you have a passion for animals, and are eager to help educate customers!"
PetSmart,1ctt7pdd41d0f000,4.0,working for petsmart is a good experience. its a good foundation to learn what you need to learn for the future in this field./ overall its a good company
PetSmart,1ctt7p5bc0kbn000,3.0,This was a filler job. I needed to fill in the time until a new position at a different buisness opened up. I think the techniques and procedures for training here are out dated.
PetSmart,1ctt4i2n5akf1800,3.0,Enjoyable workplace if you have a love for animals.
PetSmart,1ctstj7rtbrft800,1.0,Promised I would get 25 plus hours a week so I could leave my old job that was paying my Bill's and she gives me 20 ok whatever I can live still now I'm down to 8 hours a week.... manager refuses to talk to me about hours and avoids me shows blatant favoritism to another employee her and several shift leads give constant attitude to me and other employees petcare associates do nothing the store is always a gross mess I try to clean up every week when im actually on the floor but they'd rather have someone trot around the store at a turtles place doing nothing. Have also had other employees make fun of me for no reason and I cant seem to find the hr number in the breakroom hmmm
PetSmart,1ctr5uvfoakbr800,4.0,"Working at petsmart everyday was always a pleasure given the amount of knowledge and love I had for pets, so the job came naturally to me and I had a great time helping out other pet customers in need."
PetSmart,1ctqvffuk1d0f000,5.0,No assigned seating so every day you come in you have to fight to get a seat. Also management doesn't pay too much attention on who's doing what. And they definitely do play favorites
PetSmart,1ctpa9rfmas3b800,3.0,"I was in the petcare department, though also trained for cashier and hotel."
PetSmart,1ctpa8vul1d0s000,5.0,"The details of the day vary by the shift time, but generally you can expect to keep the animals safe during group play, clean their rooms, feed them, and help check animals in/out of the Hotel. Management is incredibly helpful and everyone is welcoming; no question is too silly to ask, and asking for help/working as a team is encouraged. The hardest part of the job is making sure the dogs interact nicely with each other and yourself--safety is the number one goal for every living thing at the PetsHotel. There are a few enjoyable aspects of the job, among which are working with a great team, never feeling bored, and (of course) interacting with all the dogs and cats."
PetSmart,1ctp1i888akf1800,4.0,"I loved working at this PetSmart. It was my favorite job, all my coworkers were great, management was professional but fun, hours were flexible, the work was easy and rewarding, it really was all around a great place."
PetSmart,1ctoq6k0q5nfu800,4.0,Management can improve more on the scheduling and respect for others when they are unavailable on certain days. Store manager is great but mostly feels like it's being ran by a bunch of kids.
PetSmart,1cto8mfbc0kbg001,1.0,Poor place to work because of the managements bad expectations of boxes per hour. There just wasnt enough time to finish the work n they fire you if you dont meet their expectations. I think that is discrimination and illegal.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1cto85dg0akf0800,5.0,It was a relax facility. working around animals. customers. keeping the facility clean. people are friendly. management helped you out in any way they can. you can build up in jobs
PetSmart,1ctnrptae5nfu800,5.0,"Petsmart is a great place to learn how retail can be. While it was stressful, there was almost always a dog around to pet when things got a little rough."
PetSmart,1ctmprr3baqj6800,4.0,"The staff was not always reliable. Too many people called off too often. The pay could have definitely been better. The people were otherwise great! The management was great as well! Though I think there could be more benefits, I will admit I learned a lot."
PetSmart,1ctm58hma5nfu800,1.0,"Loving animals, I thought working at Petsmart would be a great idea. That, however, was probably the worst idea."
PetSmart,1ctlpe9ljb8bt800,5.0,I learned an invaluable amount of information about animals and how to provide the best care for them and the nutritional value of most animal food brands
PetSmart,1ctlo3fiaakiv800,3.0,"really hard to make enough to survive at only 25 hours a week, workers are really nice though and tend to be helpful. management tries but they can only do so much."
PetSmart,1ctleh3liakf0800,3.0,It was very high strung and could get very stressful at times. However I did learn how to trim nails and that has helped me with my own personal dog when she needs her nails done.
PetSmart,1ctle0ru25j7h800,3.0,Company sold to consortium. Over 30% of corporate terminated. They also cut back on animal Care. They also terminated 40% of in store management. new owners not informed of pet requirements. M
PetSmart,1ctk2sc411d0e000,5.0,Pet Smart helps many with no experience to learn about animals. Nice place to learn and grow within the company. If you love animals this would be the place for you.
PetSmart,1ctjcg13jakiv800,3.0,they will promise you things you will never get. no hours given. benefits are terrible. pay is terrible. no room for advancement. managers change constantly.
PetSmart,1ctj6te75akf0800,3.0,Working with management was difficult but working with the animals made it better. Hours were hard to come by as well as a raise in that work environment
PetSmart,1ctgfe8fpb8bo800,2.0,"Just like the title says - started well, ended as a nightmare. PetSmart was fine for a long time. I might even say I really enjoyed it for a long time. Then after the company got bought, everything changed and the culture of the company vanished. Employees became numbers and little else."
PetSmart,1ctgaaqf95nbr800,4.0,"In petcare you take care of 300+ animals, given most of them are fish, their lives are in your hands. The workplace is competitive for hours and advancement often resulting in tension between coworkers."

PetSmart,1cteq00coaqj3800,4.0,If you are an animal person then this job is for you. Pet smart has a very friendly environment. With great people and a great management team. I would recommend this positions to any animal lover.
PetSmart,1ctdv1seo52vu800,2.0,"Worked in the San Diego area. This company could care less about salaried managers. They work you to death, 50 hrs a week and expect you to be an overpaid stocker. You will have almost no say in who is hired or retained. Just not a good place to work."
PetSmart,1ctdsbjrpas37800,4.0,"nice people, clean work environment, and decent hours. hardest part of the job was working with the difficult customers and the untrained dogs but other then that it was nice, i loved working with all the adorable babes."
PetSmart,1ctd407eqakbn800,5.0,Working for this company you will learn quite a bit. At this employer I’ve learned to do most of the things I still do today. They also have great benefits.
PetSmart,1ctc4agel5nfo800,5.0,Petsmart pets hotel is a productive and fun place to work if you love to interact with dogs and cats alike. Employees make you feel welcome and at home.
PetSmart,1ctbubfu35nfo800,3.0,"Everyone I worked with loved animals, and it really showed. Everyone got along and there were hardly any drama with fellow coworkers and managers. As long as animals were taken care of and safe, and customers didn't complain, everything ran smoothly. Only downside is working weekends, but schedule was flexible enough to where you didn't feel like you were missing out on personal life. Pay is what is typical for retail jobs, so not the great but not awful. It was a good part-time job while I was in school, and honestly would work there again if it could support a family."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1ctbn9eltakip800,3.0,I felt discriminated when I was working at Pet Smart due my pregnancy. The manager of the store told me he would not give me work hours due to my pregnancy. Because he had an idea that I was not reliable because of that. I was working almost 7 hours per week.
PetSmart,1ctb7n3vnakbj800,1.0,"If you aren't someone important IE a manager, groomer, or trainer then don't expect anything out of your job here. The managers generally don't care about your well being either. I was having trouble breathing while helping set up the new store where I live and it was evident too. Yet the manager walked up and basically demanded I work harder and faster or leave."
PetSmart,1ctb3gj6fak7q800,4.0,Most of the associates I work with feel underpaid and overworked.
PetSmart,1ctavl8snas34800,4.0,It's a good retail store to work for .They pay better then most and alot of room to move in petsmart . and you get to work with pets . and get to know the people you help
PetSmart,1ct9fucjgak7q800,5.0,"Working with the animals and being hands on is really exciting and fun, the pay is good if your willing to put in the hours."
PetSmart,1ct8u449naqj0800,4.0,I truly enjoyed working with the animals everyday. Customers were great. Had excellent benefits like heath insurance and paid vacations. Great place to work if you love animals.
PetSmart,1ct8jrrl8akbj800,1.0,"The grooming department was a joke, They did not care anything about their employees  Much less the co-workers who worked together. All they were was a bunch of fake people who did not like each other and they got away with a bunch of stuff."
PetSmart,1ct8hhdun5nbo800,3.0,I loved my job at PetSmart. My only issue was the hours. I never had a weekend day off and I was closing shift or late shift every day that I worked. I would definitely recommend this company to someone young without children. You will feel like you are married to the job. Another issue is the bonus incentives. They opened a new store within 10 minutes of our store and wondered why we weren’t making our daily sales anymore. That led to no one making any bonuses. I would say that PetSmart corporate needs to not open stores so close to one another. All you did was take away business from your own stores.
PetSmart,1ct8as7po1d05000,3.0,"I have worked at multiple locations and after 5 years with the company, the management is one of the primary motives for me leaving. I have worked under awesome and supportive management, and I have also worked under management that spent more time trying to micromanage it's employees and tell them how to do a very skill specific job when they themselves have never performed the job. No matter how much work you do or how well you do it never seems like enough. PetSmart also changed the pay structure for its trainers, in theory it is supposed to equal out to the same amount of pay, but I am unable to pay my bills under the new structure all while doing the same if not more workload as before. I'm sad to leave because I truly have loved my job and would consider myself good at it, but this is not a company I can be confident in anymore."
PetSmart,1ct6t17cn1d05000,1.0,"Computer super slow due to bad systems. Management is not helpful. Sexual harassment ran rampant at my store and HR doesn't do much when you call them. Groomers are treated like regular retail sales floor workers with being asked to do everything while trying to be in the salon grooming dogs as well. Expect to be asked to do more you can handle because sure enough you already get paid ""too much"".Pay was great even going down to part time but you have to take a lot of dogs to get there. Don't expect help from anyone and know the policy if you're in the salon. You can get fired if you forget it. Expect to be harassed by customers once they find your social media to groom their dogs on the side or squeeze them in that day. expect to get yelled at by management for not doing enough work."
PetSmart,1ct6nao0rak7q800,4.0,It’s a great place to work part time. It’s only fun if you’re an Associate because management right now if focusing on all the wrong things. So stay as Ana associate
PetSmart,1ct63jshj5nfo800,4.0,"A typical day at work consist of helping customers find things & answering questions & phone calls , signing customers up for treats program for discounted prices, I learned how to be even more patient when dealing with difficult customers, the workplace culture is fine, the most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that i was able to make a customer happy with their purchases"
PetSmart,1ct4g3p9i5nfo800,5.0,"I love working at PetSmart. A typical shift length is about 4.5 hours or so for part-time associates. You can get a good amount of things done in this length of a shift, but if you have to go to the vet, then those visits can take anywhere from twenty minutes to an hour, depending on how many animals you take. Although, you also have to consider the drive to the vet since there's no vet in the store."
PetSmart,1csvbsr30as34801,5.0,"Working at petsmart could be very relaxed and slow or fast paced and hectic, however managers where always there to help when it was needed. I was able to interact with many different pets, as long as it was respectful"
PetSmart,1cssac6ns52vq800,3.0,"I worked at the PetSmart Hotel in Cambridge and when I started to work there, many of the other coworkers were disrespectful and did not even help me out when I needed it. There was also a few racist  coworkers as well. If they wanted to be lazy, they would dump the work load on me. I even told my manger and she didn’t even do anything and basically told me to deal with it. Word of advice, if you want to work at PetSmart Hotel, just don’t unless you want to be pushed around because your new."
PetSmart,1css9gcv2ak7q800,5.0,"Great Company, Very friendly and Caring associates and managers. Very helpful when i first started they didnt let me down. Very loving and adorable animals."
PetSmart,1css5d65mas34800,4.0,I had the best Store manager then the district manager switched him for a terrible non working store manager who gve me no support even though I was in control of the inventory and merchandise
PetSmart,1css1huok5nfo800,3.0,"It’s not a job that I would recomend to anybody who has a family, hours are inconsistent and pay is to low to survive. Management was great but career opportunity wasn’t available"
PetSmart,1csqcr1n9b83u800,3.0,"During my time here, I did learn a lot and had great coworker experiences. I had great clients that would only request me but I still left due to management. I wanted to advance into grooming but nothing happened and they kept making mistakes in the process. If you really love washing dogs all day, then this is for you but the bathers get the most weight on their shoulders with the always changing policies. Daily tasks on top of being overbooked most of the time, just wasn't worth the stress."
PetSmart,1csq0qrc5b83u800,3.0,"Shampooed, groomed and cut the nails of the dogs. I also booked appointments for the guest dogs to be groomed. The Pet Salon is very busy. It was a fun place to work, the pay could be better."

PetSmart,1csp4fsdiakem800,4.0,The employees and lower level management were great! Very hands on and had very reasonable expectations. The upper management (ex:store manager) was a joke!!! Never hands on. Never actually stepped off of his high pedistool to see what the actual employees has to deal with. Never came to expierence the job he was expecting to get done for himself sp he could learn the ins and outs of the jobs he was actually managing.
PetSmart,1csp053igb83u800,3.0,Fun place at times with great co-workers. Got a great education regarding the care of animals I had never had as pets before (but which I now own). Customers were usually very appreciative of my assistance. Had many return customers and still shop there today. Would return if asked.
PetSmart,1csmrvnjpbrff800,5.0,Productive fun workplace. Willing to work with your schedule. encouraging and motivational associates. Must be able to work as a team in a fast pace environment.
PetSmart,1csma1kokb8bf800,4.0,Excelent place to start. Room for growth. Management changes often so the tone of the store may also change. Benefits and paid time off. Pay based on time with company
PetSmart,1cslpo8b9as2v800,3.0,"great place to work for job experience. You can move up quickly if you work hard, but all departments have their challenges. Do not expect an easy job."
PetSmart,1cskkjd105nfi800,4.0,Great place to work under correct management. Fun environment with animals everywhere. Easy to be recognized for good work ethic and constant management reviews.
PetSmart,1cskdtge6akbd800,5.0,"I love working here it is a very nice place to work, the customer is very nice and I love work with some of my coworkers, So manager really care bout the hard work that you put in its always about the bad that you do never the good even when the good out way the bad"
PetSmart,1csjulspaak7k800,4.0,Manager at the time was amazing very stricken but understanding not to many mangers you can find like that. Salon area was always fun very up beat. Never a dull moment
PetSmart,1csjid64makik801,3.0,"I was a bather in the salon and this place works you to death and then tells you youre not working hard enough. They dont give a d a m n about pets or their employees its all about the money. I tried to call in sick and was literally told no. This place is all stress, and when i tried to transfer stores the new place paid me LESS thsn what i started with!  Just stay away if you want a workplace that treats you right"
PetSmart,1csj3apgn5nbi800,2.0,"I am currently employed at petsmart. I've been there since April 2018. I'll lay it all out, and you can decide if it's worth it."
PetSmart,1csibfbdhb8bf800,5.0,"I was a stylist apprentice in the grooming salon, and a pet care associate. My co workers weren't just co workers, but my family as well. Every day I would learn something new. This was one of the most rewarding jobs yet, it could get stressful at times but as long as you pulled through to the end you could walk away with a smile knowing you accomplished it. the managers are amazing, they will always listen to you and work with you. good job PetSmart!!!!"
PetSmart,1cshgsmrqakem800,4.0,"Where i worked some days could be really busy and other days its super slow. I was mostly a cashier but i was trained as petcare too and working with the animals is really enjoyable. I learned a lot about different types of animals and this knowledge will always stick with me when I decide to move on. Ive worked at Petsmart for almost 3 years now and as i worked here i was part time because i was also going to college and their scheduling is really flexible they work with you around your school schedule and make sure that your happy with the amount of hours you'll be getting. Never dealt with aggressive dogs, majority of the customers that come in are aware that their dog is considered dangerous so they usually wouldnt even bring them in to the store with them. Also because youre allowed to bring your pets in the store ive got to see some pretty cool animals such as a monkey or a suger glider. Seeing the animals was always my favorite part of the job. Overall Petsmart is a great place to work for a college student and just in general i would recommend it."
PetSmart,1csf5sj4takem800,5.0,This is a great company to have many opportunities for experience and careers. They strive hard to set a positive and happy atmosphere for their employees.
PetSmart,1csf20v255j76800,2.0,"The managers are horrible and show favoritism. They keep pushing you to try to up sell and bother customers. They don't care about the customers,all they want is a sale. They don't care about the workers and allow customers and employees (the ones they favor)  to disrespect you. I've been there for about a year and NEVER received a promotion. If lucky you'll find the one manager you love but the rest are straight imbeciles. They hire more people and cut more hours to the point you're only getting 5-10 hours a week."
PetSmart,1csf1uita5nfi800,5.0,"Overall management was good at the location I worked at, the customers were excellent and the other employees were easy to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers get what they needed for their animals needs."
PetSmart,1cseisqi152vk800,2.0,"no one is trained, nothing but stress. workers have to look up questions on their phone because no one there is actually trained to know anything about the animals. corporate merchandise plans never actually fit the store's layout"
PetSmart,1csdspm57b83u800,3.0,The store I worked at was very poorly managed. The store manager was very passive agressive and never left the office. The managers would always call on my days off begging me to come in and at one point would tell my friends who worked there to call me and ask if I would come in. Very unprofessional.
PetSmart,1cscn8u2eb87q800,3.0,"overall the job was ok. I did not really intend on leaving, But they were not understanding with my situation at home. Great job, great co workers, very bad management."
PetSmart,1csc527t65nfi800,5.0,"I really enjoyed working there.  However, the store leader was really unorganized, and he tried to pawn his job off on everyone else.  He also got mad very easily, and never really wanted to help when needed. But, all other managers were excellent.  They were level-headed, hardworking, and easy-going, and they made sure everything ran smoothly."
PetSmart,1csc14q7sakem800,5.0,i loved working at petsmart.  it was very rewarding work dealing with the animals and the people.  and overall the people i worked with were amazing people that listened and understood you.

PetSmart,1csbu90vl52vk800,4.0,"Loved working with the animals, but as a pet care associate spent too much time running around with too much work.  Given lots of responsibility with low pay."
PetSmart,1csakb8jfb8b9800,5.0,the job i work in is the pethotel and its very fun you get to spend the day with dogs and get to just chill most of the time. the staff is very friendly and they all care for the animals and want the best.
PetSmart,1csafeqvo5j73800,3.0,"Worked for them for 10 years, quit because of managenent. Too many rules,  too much pressure and not enough praise or thank you for going above and beyond."
PetSmart,1csa7nqenakba800,5.0,I enjoyed working here. The managers cared about the store culture and the employees. The atmosphere was enjoyable to work in. They really cared about the customers and their pets.
PetSmart,1csa5vqvras2q800,3.0,"Expectations and coinciding limitations (payroll especially) prevent you from effectively running a store. They don't care as much for the animals in the store as they want you to believe. When I started, it was all about culture, but became all about numbers when the company was bought out by BC Partners."
PetSmart,1cs9l4l9fak7h800,4.0,It’s just worth it to work here. My managers are not at all understanding of needed time off. The danger of dog bites arent worth the pay especially since muzzles arent supposed to be used but pet parents get angry when you don’t want to take in their aggressive pet. I have scarring on my arms and face from scratches and bites. For barely above minimal wage? And having to work constantly over my shift hours to complete the amount of dogs they pile into your schedule? It’s not fair to me. I should’ve never taken this job. The company doesn’t care about your overall safety and well being and it’s obvious.
PetSmart,1cs8rdaprbrf8800,5.0,i loved working with petsmart and i would love to go back 1 manager i had there wasnt the greatest and was not impressed with him saying i could be rehired later he was lying and just was not cool at all!!
PetSmart,1cs886g61brf8800,3.0,i was a cashier and a pet care associate.
PetSmart,1cs6pejmdakba800,4.0,It was okay til everyone I liked quit. Then new people started coming in and taking advantage of the workplace and of your own personal products. No advancement unless you wanted to become a groomer and go to school for it
PetSmart,1cs5mdboqakb7800,4.0,"As a sales associate, I was mostly in charge of the cash register as well as exchanges and returns. It was not a difficult job but they do expect you to work hard, as with any job. I do wish that I could have gotten more involved in the animal care aspects of the job."
PetSmart,1cs5d6q6d5nbb800,2.0,if you end up working here watch your back constantly. Management is horrible don't go to any of them for anything they will all get together and it will come back to bite you in the backside. HORRIBLE PLACE TO WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
PetSmart,1cs5d4iifakeg800,3.0,"Working in the hotel is a job for someone with eternal optimism and a large amount of patience. It requires teamwork and communication or else things get very difficult. As long as you're the type of person who communicates clearly, timely, and effectively, you shouldn't have any issues."
PetSmart,1cs4t2joeb87f800,4.0,"Petsmart was a very fun place to work short term. I really enjoyed what I did there and my coworkers. The managers at my specific store were less then amazing at some points in my career, but overall I left because I couldn't gain anything more from the company."
PetSmart,1cs4mq9r7akeg800,3.0,"This used to be a great place to work when I first joined them! After rumors of a sale and the eventual takeover, things went downhill at a dizzying rate. Things are still confused. It is a very ageist culture, especially their HR Department. If you are not very young, your resume will not even be considered."
PetSmart,1cs4ku9ubak7d800,2.0,"Petsmart has become more about the money and less about the people that work there. They push you to your limit ,and farther. Their expectation from their employees are unreachable. Very demeaning, misogynistic, and rude CEO's. Workplaces culture is very unsettling. Many people try to get others fired, career advancements are limited. Management back tracks on things they promise, and keeps people that have injured animals multiple times on the team even after probationary period."
PetSmart,1cs4ioffib83i800,3.0,"I worked with the company for many years. Im not sure what it is currently like, as rite before i left the company changed ownership and they started making a lot of cuts. I was the full time pet trainer, and they kept taking my days away and even started laying people off."
PetSmart,1cs4io40cakeg800,5.0,"This job has taught me how to utilize organization skills to help other people. Also it shows me the impact I can have on an animals life, as well as the pet owner's. I have a Rottweiler, for me, taking a step forward to help educate and assist pets makes a difference."
PetSmart,1cs4iaoq35nbb800,3.0,My experience working at petsmart it had its ups and downs but i enjoyed working for the company.

I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1crl3plsjaked800,5.0,It's a great starter job or a great position for a student. The hours were great for a second job and also great for extra pocket change. I would also recommend to people who love animals.

PetSmart,1crjjr64bb8as800,5.0,"I loved working there. Great job for animal lovers! I had to leave to focus on my Senior year of High School, but I would recommend this job to anyone."
PetSmart,1crjabo34aki4800,1.0,Was a groomer for about 6 months. Was not treated very well by management and even had co-workers switching shifts on schedule without permission for their own benefit.
PetSmart,1critdeq7b874800,1.0,"It may have been only the store I was employed at, however the management was terrible. I would not recommend this as a workplace. It is an unhealthy environment and by far worsened my mental health."
PetSmart,1critd85baqib800,1.0,"Petsmart does not care about the well being of their animals nor their employees. There is little respect for the care that goes into the day-to-day of keeping the animals healthy. They don't give you any time to give the animals proper attention. They don't educate you enough to properly care for the animals. All they care about is that you harass the customers enough until they feel obligated to buy something. They neglect to train their employees correctly and show zero interest in the struggle to complete everything (except for gossiping about you if you make any sort of mistake).  They ask too much for the time that's given. Their wages are sad and the hours are even worse. They'll overwhelm you with unusual and long shifts one week and then cut you down to nothing the next. Don't waste your time, this job will just diminish your self esteem and hope for humanity."
PetSmart,1crgrkp1252v1800,5.0,It was an amazing job. I loved working there and learned a lot of amazing things to help me grow as a person. I also learned how to work fast and help with customer service
PetSmart,1crgqr0l0aqib800,5.0,Absolutely loved working at PetSmart if you love animals then this is a definitely a good place to work. Working in the Pet Care Department was a little stressful having to take care of all the animals and deal with customers management was poor and the hours were okay the only benefit of working here is if you loved animals
PetSmart,1crfnsujl52v1800,2.0,I’m currently working at a micro store. No room for growth within the store. Only two FT Positions; Store Leader and Assistant Store Leader. All projects or operations in the store are passed to whichever key holder is working that day with no communication from the Store Leader. This leads to disorganization and always catching up on store tasks. It’s embarrassing to work at this location most days due to the very “green” leadership from a very inexperienced Store Leader.
PetSmart,1crem63adak73800,1.0,This company was one of the worst companies i have personally ever worked for. There management was never there. The lack of care for the animals that entered the facility was extremely poor. They do not care about the animals what so ever. The staff is not educated enough to provide enough care for the animals they sale.
PetSmart,1crejrfhnb8as800,5.0,I love working here it had been my lifelong dream. It is a quick paced environment with a lot to learn. I enjoy my management who are always willing to work with me.
PetSmart,1creh59iu5nev800,3.0,"Terrible place to work! The managers were always rude, the store was not organized, they requested a large amount of work to be done in an impossible amount of time, there was a lot of favoritism and unfairness. The managers date each other and other employees. They do not work around school schedules fairly. They do not accommodate medical emergencies in the best way, nor excuse you for them."
PetSmart,1crd6fpafb8as800,5.0,Working here has honestly giving me the option to grow in retail. Highly recommend if that’s something you want.  I know there’s some petsmart stores that have poor management so be sure to ask around before applying to a certain location.
PetSmart,1crb6c6jm5nev800,4.0,"MIL starts early 3,4,5 am working trucks and running day to day activities, stocking, pricing, inventory control etc."
PetSmart,1crato8rr5nev800,2.0,"Working for Petsmart has been a ride. While the pay is okay, the benefits are great, and the hours for fulltime have been plentiful; the overall work environment is poor. The rest of the management team are unreliable, unorganized, and uncaring. I'm sure thats not the case for every store but it certainly was for mine. While I did get 40 hours a week, the inconsistency of set days and times got very stressful. Some nights you are there from 1 until 9:30 pm and expected to come back in at 6 am the next day. Some weeks you'll be working 8 days in a row because of poor scheduling. They dont allow overtime. In fact, payroll was just poor. Often times the assistant manager wouldnt have enough hours to provide enough staff for the day. So, it just got very stressful.  Its a great place for the part time employees. It's great if you want full time hours but no time to do anything else with your life. Petsmart wants your life to revolve around the company, which would be fine if they had a bit more compassion for the employees who are wasting away trying to keep the store up to standards."
PetSmart,1cras6sm8ak73800,2.0,Petsmart had great benefits as well as tuition compensation programs but the management was very poor. Management was not good at supporting employees.
PetSmart,1craph1seaki4800,5.0,"I enjoyed this job, except for the hours.  No set schedule.  You can not usually have a bad day working around animals.  When kids come in with their parents to adopt a new pet, the excitement they feel is infectious!"
PetSmart,1crahpstfas2b800,3.0,"I enjoyed my time at Petsmart, but I definitely don't view it as a career place. The burocracy of corporate sometimes got extremely annoying when they put a lot of pressure and focus on things that are sometimes out of our control. The customers in the pet industry are exceptionally dense and resistant to change, but some are willing to listen to reason and truly want what is best for their pets."
PetSmart,1cr9ls3g55nav800,3.0,"Used to love the environment and that job, management changed over the years and in the end i did felt like i did not deserve to be treated the way they treated."
PetSmart,1cr9egm0laqib800,5.0,"very hard and demanding job, but with a good management team and co workers things are a little easier. You will get scratched and dirty but it pays off in the end."

PetSmart,1cr8nnh4352v1800,4.0,"Started as a Manager, asked to step down to dog trainer. Loved being a dog trainer. Would still be there if the didn't force my resignation due to an injury."
PetSmart,1cr89omj05j6j800,2.0,"Although I loved grooming, the store manager was horrible and cheap. He refused to buy new tables and dryers when they broke down said they're too expensive, he also played favoritism towards a few employees. Management never scheduled people properly in the store so there was never enough employees working to help or cover lunches. The girls (groomers) in grooming it was nothing but constant high school drama bs, they always were complaining about each other and telling on each other like they're a bunch of 6 year olds, always stabbing each other in the back, one min they're your friends next min they're try to get you fired. No one in that entire store has each other's back nor do they respect each other. The entire place is falling apart and isn't run properly, everybody is rude to each other even to the customers, and such lack of communication. They really don't care if you have an home life and kids they always want you to work. In grooming (the groomers have no respect for your request clients and always trying to steal them away from you, if they're mad at you for whatever reason they will refuse to schedule you dogs pretty much stealing your money"
PetSmart,1cr663p3i5neu800,4.0,"Great place to work for college students or older candidates. Not career oriented unless in management, but great chance to advance to that also."
PetSmart,1cr5us084brep800,5.0,"PetSmart is a fantastic company with a unique set of Code of Ethics due to its love for pets and animals. It's management is overly fair, and completely understanding to employee needs and situations."
PetSmart,1cr5rtvuf5j6i800,5.0,"great job if you like to work with animals, customers were really nice. Coworkers were great they helped each other management was good to it was nice job !"
PetSmart,1cr5pc27a5j6i800,3.0,"I'll preface this by saying that the Store Leader was more than capable and was a very effective leader. On top of that, the geographic area did not make it easy to find quality help. However, the other 3 managers were absolutely atrocious. horrible at communicating with each other, let alone the employees. Frequent mistakes by closing managers led to me having to stay longer while they cleaned up their messes. They did not motivate or train well, and unless the Store Leader was working, could not answer ANYTHING having to do with product since they were all outside hires. Horrible leadership and management at that store, and without the Store Leader, it would undoubtedly fail."
PetSmart,1cr5oprm95neu800,2.0,This was actually my first job at 18 and i worked there for about 6 years combined(left for 2 yrs and came back). I did almost everything but manage and groom dogs basically. Got bad pay and only told to hurry up by managers who did nothing but sit in the office all day. If your a true animal lover I definitely dont recommend. The places they order animals from have animals in horrible conditions and most come in sick or dead. Since we had a vet on staff we would try to treat them but we couldn't always give them what they really needed because everything goes by corporate rule and corporate has no idea what they're doing.
PetSmart,1cr44r1kpb8aq800,4.0,Working in retail is not fun but this job is nice since you work with animals. Definitely a fast paced environment for the most part and opened most days of the year .
PetSmart,1cr37btamak72800,5.0,Petsmart is great! It is a very physically demanding job depending on where in the store you work. Wonderful managers at the location I work. Love them!

PetSmart,1cr2tr0qp5nau800,4.0,I enjoyed working there it was a nice place to work working there I worked mon thru Friday and I enjoyed that a lot.  I was in good company working there.
PetSmart,1cr14stlsak6v800,3.0,I feel petsmart does not pay its employees fairly. The people on the bottom usually do the most work while management gets paid to do hardly anything. Has a high turn over rate because people leave unwilling to do the amount of work for such little pay.
PetSmart,1cr0ho4e5ak6v800,4.0,Nothing new to any one that has worked retail. A very pet friendly environment. I enjoyed working for PetSmart. The only thing I did not like was the availability of advancement.
PetSmart,1cr068pja5j6f800,1.0,Workday will last 10 to 12 hours and you ensure compliance and meeting daily goals established. Associates and customers are great and are awesome to work for. There is truly a lack of connection between leadership and associate.
PetSmart,1cquvkielb86v800,1.0,"Poor upper management, quality of work day/expectations were ridiculous, horrible ethics, internal favoritism, employees who live together work in the same store"

PetSmart,1cqqrk2idaqi7800,1.0,I was a dog trainer they gave me less than 20 hours a week to work and I didn't make much money.  I also traveled really far for this job.  It was not fun and they didn't care about the animals just making money
PetSmart,1cqoiaqkeaqi7800,5.0,Nice company to work for. Working with pets is very calming and fun. There are opportunities to learn more every day. The most difficult thing was being paid by commission and hoping that co-workers would be fair in setting up appointments.
PetSmart,1cqn86ku6akam800,4.0,"I started working here after I turned 18, I love the work environment and also love the management. It was a really fun job and I wish I could’ve stayed they just didn’t have the hours I needed. Really easy, and fun and you get a hang around with little animals every day. What more could you ask for!! They are so keep up with your raises and how well you do at work it makes you feel really appreciated."
PetSmart,1cqmo19gkaki0800,3.0,"If you love working with dogs and cats then you would love it. However it does come at a price. The job doesn't offer many hours for entry level position such as ""Pet Care Specialist"". All PCS employees work part time unless they move up the employment ranks. I thought I could manage with that pay in the beginning, but after 8 months I am struggling financially. I asked upper management for more hours like full time, however, I never heard back regarding my request."

PetSmart,1cqkvvt6mbrem800,4.0,I love working at PetSmart but I disliked the scheduling. The work day can either be amazing with proper staff or a horrible shift with only the minimum amount of help.
PetSmart,1cqkvugh6b832800,5.0,I didn’t get much real training. And within a month I was training a new employee. Everyone is nice and you build bonds with your coworkers. You have to be able to work under pressure and never take anything personal.

PetSmart,1cqhphi5db82u800,2.0,"Was my first job. Started at the petshotel in Beverly hills and after almost 2 years transferred over here to long beach in hopes that the level of care was better. It wasn't. They dont treat the dogs with the respect and love they deserve. Rather than give a dog a walk, they'll let them take care of their business in their kennels and act like they were attentive the whole time."
PetSmart,1cqhi7mbjaqi3800,4.0,"I worked as an early morning stocker at Petsmart in Loganville,GA . I honestly loved working there, the only reason I left was due to a family issue that is not Pet Smart related. I had to go out of state for an extended period of time."
PetSmart,1cqhh2t275j6b800,2.0,Good beginning job but not a stable career. Hours were cut. Doesn't pay enough for the work you do. Most days they were short staffed so they would call people who were on their day off to come into work last minute.

PetSmart,1cqc45p1raqhs800,4.0,"I worked as a contract cleaner, but I observed the work environment at Petsmart for five years--it is not easy work--lots of stocking, as it is a very busy place, but the customers that come in (especially the ones that bring their pets) are friendlier, as pets have that effect on humans; I was particularly impressed at the amiability between the employees at Petsmart--they seemed to like and respect each other and help each other out and (as a 54 year old now) I have worked some places where that geniality was not present. One of the better places to work."
PetSmart,1cqbqn801b86k800,4.0,Place is great place to get your foot in the door in the pet industry. Working with all sorts of animals. Being able to work around people who love animals as much as you do is always great.

The work can be very stressful: sales goals, training staff, scheduling, working crazy long hours, poor management, and not afforded enough time or labor for staff to get all the work done. BUT the pets makes it very tolerable. I love animals and being around them can be very therapeutic during trying times at to work."
PetSmart,1cpir0u87bre7800,1.0,"terrible store management, no consequences for anyone’s actions even when safety was an issue, no support from the core management. terrible company overall. high turnover rate"
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1cpidf3hp5j64800,3.0,If you are a pet owner or love animals this is the place to be.  Even if you don not have a pet of your own it can be very enjoyable and rewarding.  Many areas to learn and grow within the store.  Working with the customers and their animals was very rewarding.
PetSmart,1cpgui8ihbre7800,4.0,Great management team but not a lot of advancement opportunities. They work with you and as long as you show up and keep busy you will be treated well by the managers. Petsmart is definitely a corporation so don't expect the company to care about anything except sales. Animals are not a priority with Petsmart so you have to make sure you have a good group of people to keep the petcare/hotel/grooming salon safe for animals.
PetSmart,1cpgmfa9ob8a5800,4.0,Fast-paced work in an animal friendly environment.  Typical day as a stocker would include rotating between what merchandise would be stocked and which planograms would be set.
PetSmart,1cpgl4ed4b868800,4.0,"Flexible work schedule, fun work environment with pets at work, corporate office benefits of cafe, special discounts and events on location, friendly coworkers."
PetSmart,1cpfsl77vbre2800,4.0,"Generally a good work environment except the workers can be very unprofessional. Managers have been great overall. Scheduling is a bit annoying because it’s very difficult to get time off and if you have an emergency and can’t find someone to cover you’re required to come in. You get a lot of repeat customers so it’s nice getting to know the people that come in. Pays average, not a lot of opportunity for advancement which is why I left. Overall not a bad place, but not a job youd want for a long time."
PetSmart,1cpfbdre5as1i800,2.0,really don't wanna talk about this job other then say it full of bull hate the job. all I can tell you is go work for them and youll see for yourself.
PetSmart,1cpe44rg7b828800,4.0,This place was awesome! I really miss it here work was fast pace but fun because of all the animals! the management was great and the company really cares about its employees! great place for anyone looking for a part-time job!
PetSmart,1cpdb24ji5na5800,2.0,The managers are often rude and not helpful to their workers they are training. Some of the managers here bully some of their employees and even embarrass them in front of customers. Each manager has their own way they want things done which makes you have to redo most of your tasks multiple times a day in order to please the wants of the managers that is on the clock that day.
PetSmart,1cpd6qjiqaka2800,5.0,"I worked at PetSmart for 3 years. I started off as a cashier then moved to pet care, which is taking care of the animals in store, and now I am the Pet Trainer  which is super fun! PetSmart is a super fun place to work. The managers at my store are awesome and the environment is really enjoyable. Definitely a place I would recommend!!"
PetSmart,1cpd3mq53b828800,3.0,"Working at one of the largest locations it can definitly get stressful. Some managers are definitly a lot more helpful and proactive about helping while others are not. If you do your job well and get along with staff and management likes you will definitly be considered to move up, otherwise you wont. They are extremey flexible with working and school schedules"
PetSmart,1cpcv3qdiakdf800,4.0,I had a great time while volunteering at Pet Smart. The staff was very caring and I could tell that they were passionate about their job. The environment is always stress-free and you will always have room to improve.
PetSmart,1cpcoej4iak68800,3.0,"If you are perhaps a college kid that wants a flexible job and you know a pretty good amount about companion animals and fish, plus you don’t have any bills to pay then this job would be good. I was paid not near enough to make a living and yet expected to do the most at this job. Only worked an average of 4 hours a day and at $9 an hour you can do the math. Pay checks were a joke at around $150 a week... if you’re a manager of course you work 8-9 hour shifts and get whatever days you want off. On Sundays I worked 10:00 a.m-8:00 p.m. Sunday was pretty much the only day you could get a decent shift. Discounts were pretty good at 15% off and an even bigger discount on store brands. You have to deal with many a stupid person at this job. On several occasions I’d have people want advice on fish, yet they wouldn’t listen and would get irritated at my advice. We weren’t allowed to sell goldfish or any large fish to people putting them in bowls. This was a major irritation for customers. I had a family get angry  with me be because I wouldn’t sell them two Oscar cichlids that were going in a 5.5 gallon tank. That would have been certain death for those fish... so yes you will deal with stupid people. So if you can deal with lack of pay, customers acting up, and inconsistent work hours then this job is good."
PetSmart,1cpbkk7dubre2800,4.0,It was a blast working there the people are great and work experience is worth it if you want to get into customer service jobs. Always ask question if you can.
PetSmart,1cpbc9s5oakdf800,3.0,I would not recommend working for this company. They do not care about the safety of the pet just bringing in revenue. I saw so many pets get cut and hurt due to the stress of trying to get as many dogs groomed in an 8 hour period.
PetSmart,1cpb9kqtpas1i801,4.0,"This was a job I truly loved. I was very involved in the business and I enjoyed the customers and pets who would shop in the store. I left for another opportunity, but always look back and think to myself, I should have never left."
PetSmart,1cpaj3o3ab8a5801,5.0,"I only started at Petsmart a few weeks ago. So far, it has been a great experience. You can bring your pets with you to work! How cool is that. If you like animals, this is the place to be. Everyone has been so kind and helpful."
PetSmart,1cpa0m93fakhe800,4.0,work was good I like working with a deadline at hand makes me work hard. the atmosphere needs improvement but professional etiquette was outstanding
PetSmart,1cp7shl2a52u8800,2.0,"My availability was part-time, 20-25 hours a week. When I first started the hours were exactly as I asked. After two months, I was receiving less than 10 hours a week."
PetSmart,1cp7om3v1akhe800,1.0,I would not recommend working for Petsmart. THey do not promote from within instead they bring people in who do not know anything about pets and the pet care industry. The pay is also horrible and barely above minumum wage.  Also they keep people on who do not work and give them more hours
PetSmart,1cp56dqp9b8a5800,2.0,"Poor management, a lot of free time. I was made to feel like the managment was out to get me and ended up calling HR about it, even though nothing was done after having done so."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1cp3gm875bre2800,3.0,"As a corporation its intent is good, It all depends on management at store level. There is no reinforcement for doing a good job. There are some great leaders and then there are BOSSES that ONLY care about how THEY look! They push harder to get you to work more for less pay and will bully you if you don't."
PetSmart,1cp1sn1a4b868800,4.0,"it is a great place to work. the benefits are awesome, and most of the time management is on top of things properly. I will say some on the rules should be modified and properly done."
PetSmart,1cp09p9ocaqhf800,3.0,Fun and energetic team members help make the work and day go well. Although leadership and technology are stubborn and old. Management has stern rules and ways to do things while refusing to listen to suggestions for improvements towards efficiency and productivity.
PetSmart,1cp04mrdqas1h800,5.0,"I love working here, but I feel as though it is hard to make enough money to survive. I've dedicated three years to this company and feel as though I should be compensated a little better."
PetSmart,1coum6jbdaqhd800,3.0,"Pretty decent to work for, you work together as a team."
PetSmart,1couc7ktdak9v800,1.0,"I was with the company for a full 9 years as a groomer. The first 5 years or so I really enjoyed it, until they got bought up and had new owners. Management is a constant revolving door. I got paid hardly anything and was treated very poorly along with all our other co workers from management. The grooming academy is a freaking joke now. Dogs are getting injured left and right because they rush people through it so the company can make more money. Also, they want groomers to sell a ridiculous amount of packages and addons, and dont forget emails and, answering phones AND  paperwork and reminder calls, stupid progress reports and hop, in and out, crazy rules they come up with every month.... idk how people stand it..."
PetSmart,1cou1sr3952u5800,1.0,Petsmart as a company isn't terrible but the people they allowed to manage it was. the environment was hostile and there was always stress. Awful management! beware!
PetSmart,1cotihtkob825800,1.0,"Only work here if you want the life sucked out of you management dosent really care about the well being of the animals as long as they hit their ""numbers"". Lots of dogs would be left in kennels for hrs before being let out for a ""walk"". And I don't care for the segregation of so called ""bully breeds"" totally unfair and unethical. They don't ask for fecal exams either so that leaves a lot of untreated dogs with worms in the facility, which if found they swoop your dog to banfield and you get charged an arm and a leg for treatment you didn't even authorize. Don't get me wrong I had great co-workers and some managers but for the most part I loathed PetSmart."
PetSmart,1coqjdrk6brdv800,5.0,I really enjoyed working at PetSmart. I love animals and I enjoyed helping people with training their pets. And enjoyed the overall customer service interaction.
PetSmart,1coqa0i4aak65800,4.0,"Provide excellent customer service. Process returns. Operate a cash register. Clean animal habitats as well as replace food and water through out the day. Replace all trash bins in the store, sweep the floor under isels, use automatic srubbber to clean the floor, sanitize bathrooms registers and faucets."
PetSmart,1copeen1652u4800,3.0,"It’s not bad if you’re young. It requires a lot of standing, lifting, and climbing of ladders. Depending upon which department you’re working in, you may or may not get all of your breaks or have any help during the busiest time."
PetSmart,1copbf20pbrdu800,2.0,"When you ask for help, very little is given. And animals seemed in poor conditions from distributor and employees not properly trained on pet health and well being. I was excited to work with animals until I saw how many were under cared for. And the manager and assistant manager constantly bud heads and fight in front of customers and employees, making a stressful work environment."
PetSmart,1coorqsmnak9u800,3.0,"This company will put  you through school to learn a valuable trade in exchange for a 2-year work contract, Generally everyone works well together save for the typical spats you get with a whole bunch of catty females all contained in a stressful small environment. Great benefits, but they are more interested in how much money you make them instead of the well-being and comfort of customers/animals."
PetSmart,1cooqicv85na1800,3.0,"PetSmart is not a company that values its employees over sales. Even after achieving your individual goals (add-ons, average tickets, productivity of 8 hr shift), they continue to push you until you're burnt out. You can succeed for three months in a row, but if you slip a little for a week, they hound you about ""what you can do better."""
PetSmart,1coopl2fmb824800,4.0,Management was a treat to work for and had a vested interest in employees.  Opportunities to learn new skills and demonstrate those skills. Repeat customers so you go to know the names of the customers.
PetSmart,1coog9bspakha800,5.0,PetSmart offers training in their different animals they offer products for with earned raises.  I found it a positive environment to work in.
PetSmart,1coode7on5ne1800,5.0,I loved my time at Petsmart. It was a great stepping stone into Corporate America. It taught me the fundamentals that I use daily with my current job. Very fast-paced and detail oriented as well as customer service as #1 priority. I loved seeing the wagging tails as the customers would walk in the store and learned a lot about pet health and nutrition which is a plus since I have pups of my own.
PetSmart,1coo6iump5na1800,2.0,"It was hard work and depending on management it can either be good or bad, do your research and see where the best managers are and then you will find a great place to work"
PetSmart,1coml6ltvak64800,3.0,It is a fun place to work; however corporate puts a lot of pressure on you for certain goals to the point where it is ridiculous and frustrating. I would recommend working here for the benefits and the actual job though.
PetSmart,1coltbs7lbrdu800,4.0,"This job is fun and hard work, however there is little room for growth and not a reliable job if you are looking for a career. There are always pets in the store and a few fun positions to fill"

PetSmart,1cokcbvuhb864800,3.0,"Most of the dogs are good (except some who might nip and fight for the nail trims which is pretty ""normal"")."
PetSmart,1cojlcdvv52u4800,4.0,"Loved the management at my store that i worked at, ended up leaving because i was offered another job that was full time, other then the normal corporate stuff it was a great job"
PetSmart,1cojij95fb8a1800,4.0,"I liked working at Petsmart but it was only temporary. The managers were good,"
PetSmart,1cojecj08b824800,3.0,Not being given enough resources to take care of our animals. Especially the sick.
PetSmart,1coj8nf98as1e800,3.0,"My salon manager was amazing but store managers are not understanding or supportive and do not treat salon team well. Loved the actual position, but lack of support from store management and low pay for how much work is done makes it not worth it."
PetSmart,1coj6m4l5brdu800,1.0,"Jobs was very very very easy, management is poor, booby the the director is a snake in the grass and talks bad behind your back and is a goosip queen."
PetSmart,1coj5env8akdb800,1.0,i was hired to petsmart with the understanding that i would be eligible for advancements and other oprotunities as my term with the company grew.
PetSmart,1coiv3g4mak9u800,3.0,"After the company was bought out they stopped caring about the workers. I loved my job, until they were no longer flexible with scheduling or supportive of their people."
PetSmart,1coh148j2akdb800,2.0,I loved the job. Hated management. The hours sucked. Its a great job if you’re just doing it for fun not for pay. The pets were the best part! I was a cashier and was asked and expected to stock during my shift. When a customer would come up to the register I was expected to be there asap and would get called out all the time for it. They pretty much dont wanna pay 2 people to do 2 jobs so they try to suck the work and energy out of everyone to save money.
PetSmart,1cogrpbi8ak9u800,2.0,"I was excited to work at Petsmart as I love animals. The customers were awesome, but the management was very poor. It was like you didn’t really matter. They were there to get a paycheck and didn’t seem to care about anything else. They picked favorites and gave very little to no hours to the ones they “didn’t like”. They promise things to you in an interview and those promises never happen. They made it a very stressful work environment. The store seemed super cluttered all the time, animals didn’t seem to be cared for as much as they should be (some were even dying), and fellow co-workers were lazy. Overall it’s a good place to work if you’re looking for a first time job, but if you’re looking for something to make money to pay bills, this job isn’t the one for you. You’re better off at McDonalds where you can actually advance to better opportunities."
PetSmart,1cogrhqvm52u4800,4.0,"Really loved working there; however, was taken off the time sheet and used as ""on-call"" because of low percentage of email capture. Most either already had email or didn't have a computer, or just wasn't interested.  After being 'on-call"" a short while, I called and spoke to the Manager and advised her to take me off the schedule.   I was not paid very much and going in for a few hours here and there wasn't working for me,"
PetSmart,1cogpqotuaqhc800,5.0,"Coming to work at about 4 am and breaking down the received pallets, or working their stock in the back room. I learned even greater time management skills, team work and work place safety. Management was a fun extremely helpful group. The coworkers were some of the most fun colorful people I've worked with. It was also nice having lots of regulars with some beautiful animals coming in. The hardest part of the job was often I'd work 12 hour shifts that were fast paced. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around animals all day and being able to interact with almost all the animals."
PetSmart,1cogj7urhakdb800,5.0,"I very much enjoyed working at PetSmart, It was a great place to work. Love dogs and cats, its a really nice place to work. If you can get a job there your lucky."
PetSmart,1cogevmt0ak9u801,5.0,I loved working at petsmart. Unfortunately it is not a company to work for if you have a family.  Pay is not good and hours are difficult.  But my manager  at the time was great and I would go back.
PetSmart,1coeklc1u5j5q800,4.0,Love this place family first type of environment everyone worked as one hours were great an the benefits were a bonus weekly pay as well. Always was a way to stay busy.
PetSmart,1coe5mmpcb823800,5.0,i love working here. i just wish they gave more hours but as part time associate you can only work up to 28 hrs and no more. The environment coworkers are great though and seeing pets all day is a plus. i love it
PetSmart,1coe56b1aak63800,3.0,"I enjoyed my time at the Petsmart in Catonsville, but I felt like I was not payed enough for how hard and dedicated I was to making the pet owners happy."
PetSmart,1coe47rtsaqhb800,3.0,"Stocked shelves, learned different foods for pets. Management was ok. Co workers were fun. Christmas and Thanksgiving luncheon. Nothing hard about the job"
PetSmart,1codv2r5takda800,3.0,"I have worked for multiple PetSmart locations and been in many different positions. That being said, the culture is good most of the time, but unfortunately the company, in general, does not provide enough support, training, and in general, money to help the stores succeed. Management in general scrapes to get by. They are very overworked, the expectations are really stupid, and corporate is not in touch with reality at all when it comes to working in store. They could be great, but continue to make bad business decisions, and this gives the store, in general, a high burn out rate."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1codup9stbrdt800,1.0,"It's a job I loved working with the animals, and I still do. Petsmart has a lot of policies that I don't agree with, and that was one of my causes for leaving. The management are oblivious to everyday going ons, and don't hide showing blatant favoritism to certain employees. My co-workers were all awesome to work with, but the corporate greed and lack of care is why I left."
PetSmart,1codmn5e3as1c800,5.0,"Overall Petsmart is an excellent company to start off for a first job, petsmart offers many different types of opportunities to grow and learn with them."
PetSmart,1codm3ck45ne0800,4.0,"I work in a salon with people who are like family. There is always someone willing to help if you have a difficult dog. Some pet parents can be hard to deal with, but there are some that are wonderful and truly appreciate you."
PetSmart,1cocfc6daakh6800,4.0,"I love this job, but there were specific managers that made it extremely difficult to stay calm and have a good day at work. Any day that they weren't there was a day I had fun, I enjoyed the work, and I worked my tush off. My favorite aspect was the pet parents. I had a lot of regulars I loved to talk to and catch up with, and help them find any new solutions they might need. Working here makes you quick to change your mind about a lot of animals. I went from not wanting to put my hands in the fish tanks to owning too many animals and just walking around with a python on my arm."
PetSmart,1coc35aa5as18800,2.0,"Everyone there was fun to work with and were more then willing to help out  if necessary. The breaks there were short, but overall just a really enjoyable place to work at."
PetSmart,1coc30u1gbrdq800,4.0,"I learned a lot about working and handling animals at Petsmart. I cared for them by preparing meals, walking dogs, cleaning rooms, bathing dogs, doing nail trims, and working with pet parents to ensure we cared for pets properly. We work as a team and learn from one another. We get extremely busy during the holiday season and summers."
PetSmart,1coc2o25u52tt801,5.0,PETSMART is an outstanding company with outstanding employees.  The managers have great training and know how to work with people.  I enjoyed it a lot.  I received outstanding training and benefits which I apply on a day-to-day basis in my other work.
PetSmart,1cobfdsjgak5t800,4.0,PetSmart is a good place to work if you are looking for either a part time job to earn extra money on the side or if you are looking to eventually move into retail management.
PetSmart,1cob5ogvsak9p800,1.0,Higher level management would not provide ample supplies or training for employees or lower level managers. No communication between higher and lower managers.
PetSmart,1cob2cnonakh6800,5.0,I loved the atmosphere of Petsmart and the productivity at the end of every shift. I learned a lot during my time working at Petsmart and gained more confidence in myself and my abilities.
PetSmart,1co9h9mlo5ndt802,4.0,Petsmart was actually my first job ever. I was 18 at the time just graduated and it was an 2 hour bus ride from where i lived. It was cool i learned a bit and my co-workers were super nice and we actually had lunch break.
PetSmart,1co958oa8akd7800,3.0,Wonderful place to work. I had a wonderful time working here. The environment is fast paced and competitive. The staff is hardworking and very knowledgeable.
PetSmart,1co8v4afnaqh8800,3.0,the overall task are not too complicated and at times can be very enjoyable if you love working with animals however management definitely puts a strain on the work environment
PetSmart,1co8lo4dh5n9t800,4.0,"My reason for leaving was issues w/the scheduler.  I can't live on 5 hours a week.Most management was good, some were less productive at their jobs.  Overall I liked working there."
PetSmart,1co75hqpdas17800,5.0,PetSmart is a productive place to work. PetSmart enables you to see various types of animals come in to the store. Animals and customer service are a great deal at PetSmart.
PetSmart,1co6qr0hkb89p800,5.0,"Fun place to work, enjoyed the atmosphere, it was really fun to work around the animals and care for them, customers were always nice and polite,  I would recommend this job"
PetSmart,1co6nspdv5ndr800,3.0,"Lots of higher up management shifting around from store to store. Employees dont last long. Alot of straight out of high school, first time job people so lots of lack of experience and management doesnt want to train. Two store managers and two assistant store managers have been fired from my store alone for theft. Overworked while being underpaid. Favoritism is how people get promoted. Not actual workmanship. Too many dogs have health problems in hotel because young adults dont care and managers trying too hard to be cool instead of being a boss. Quite a few dogs have died in the hotel from lack of attention. Theres so much more to name but now ive gotten mad just thinking of this place."
PetSmart,1co6ilj9takd6802,4.0,"The people and animals are fun to work with, mostly, but the hours you get as a bather at the petsmart I work for are inconsistent and very low I've been getting only 14 hours for three weeks and now I'm getting only 20 hours."

The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1co67t83v5ndr800,2.0,Petsmart was my first job. I worked in the grooming salon as a bather. WIthin the 9 months I was there I watched countless managers leave/be terminated. a very high school level of maturity between employees and management. Store pets are kept in incorrect husbandry.
PetSmart,1co4fajjgak9o800,4.0,"I cared for the small animals, birds, reptiles, and fish.  I made sure that customers went home with the right products to insure their new family member  would live a healthy and happy life."
PetSmart,1co1o7kl2b85v800,5.0,The employees at Petsmart make sure they are as educated as possible to be able to help customers out as best as they can. They make sure to take care of the animals and treat every animal that comes in with love. They take very good care of their employees and leave room for advancement with working with animals.
PetSmart,1co1k2ig7akd6800,3.0,better management help in the salon would make it less stressful and more enjoyable. Hardest part was not having help from managers. I enjoyed working with the salon staff and the dog clients that would come in.
PetSmart,1cnvo545752tr800,4.0,"I have to say this is one of my favorite jobs. It's pretty laid back and the work is not hard at all. Every day you work is pretty much the same except for Saturdays. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays you come in at 2AM and usually leave around 9-10AM. You get there, you clock in, you re-stage the area you're working in so that pallets from the truck can fit, you work those pallets, and you're done. Simple work. On Saturdays it's different. There is no truck on saturday, so you're left to basically fill holes the whole day. Showing up on saturdays is pretty much pointless if you ask me, but hey I enjoy the pay and the hours so whatever they need me to do, ill do it. Most of your day is done without the presence of customers, the only times customers are an issue is when the store opens but most days you're out before they even get there. Pay is a little above minimum wage. Once you get used to a new sleep schedule everything is fine. Management is fantastic at my store, but I can only speak for myself."
PetSmart,1cnu7cspf5j5m800,3.0,"A typical day would be coming into the grooming center, putting on the smock, checking the system to see who we have coming in for the day and who is already here, checking to make sure crates are ready for impending visitors, making sure current visitors are well taken care of with water and a urine gate, checking in a new visitor, checking with customer that the services listed in the system are exactly what they want or are expecting, checking for up to date rabies vaccination records, lashing the dog and taking them to the back. Depending on the orders in the system, I would either begin bathing or begin a simple nail trimming. This continues all day while going through at least 12 dogs on your own."
PetSmart,1cnsp0bofb89mceb,3.0,"Petsmart was a nice place to work except for the power struggle between management. The management at the Petsmart i worked at had a operations manager and a product manager and they both were grabbing for power so if you were OK with one the other one made your life a hard. Eventually one got fired and the other got promoted and one of the assistant manager moved up and made me train my lead while looking me over. The reason i left was  because my HR manager was having family problems and I called out which put me in her sights so i left. All in all it was a fun place to work but management needs work. So i do recommend working for Petsmart but only if there isn't a power struggle, know who the boss is."
PetSmart,1cnrna8tibrdmfm1,1.0,I only worked here for 8 months but it was enough time to mess me up mentally and emotionally.
PetSmart,1cnpq6uo0brdjd43,3.0,"It was great to learn about the animals. However I wanted to get into the grooming program, which was why I started at PetSmart. Every time I asked to speak to management about this they said they were busy, so I ended up getting stuck as a cashier which was not at all what I wanted to do."
PetSmart,1cnpprj6hak9ib5b,4.0,"Through the time that I had spent there working for Buster's Friends, there was never any sort of disagreement with management as it was a volunteer organization."
PetSmart,1cnpou2otak9ia0j,3.0,PetSmart is an okay place to work if you want to work somewhere that when you put in schedule changes and time off forms almost a month before you need it and they say that they did not see it and then you go and find the paper and show them.
PetSmart,1cnpnom24b89jdgb,4.0,"I love pet smart a lot, especially in LA but it really depends what management you get. Sometimes people get and ego trip and its no fun to go to work. Other places its a wonderful time and you love working almost like your not working.Grooming was the best, I cant speak for different jobs in the stores."
PetSmart,1cnpj6s6sb85ofkd,3.0,"I worked as a Bather for about 10 months. The interview process is pretty easy. The first interview I did was with store managers then the grooming manager. I was getting paid minimum wage but at the time I was living with my parents so it didn't matter too much. I was the only bilingual speaker in the whole store which sucked because I was constantly being interrupted to translate for everyone. The reason I quit was because I was getting paid less than another bather that started with me and she only spoke one language and once all the managers switched locations, my new manager didn't respect my sunday availability. This is a good job for a first job if you live with your parents but I decided to get a different job that didn't pay me 8.25 an hour and then expect me to stop working to help everyone else. The best thing about this job was working with a variety of dogs."
PetSmart,1cnphumg9ak5lct9,2.0,"Very stressful and tiring environment, I would never ever recommend. Terrible pay, and not enough time to get the work done in a reasonable timeframe."
PetSmart,1cnpa4q205n9k9s0,1.0,"I would never consider shopping at Petsmart or Chewy again, let alone work there.  They put forth an image of knowledge and engagement, but cut hours so badly that goal is beyond unattainable.  The staff is miserable and behavior reflects that.  I wouldn't trust an answer from a staff member on just about anything-- the training on products on the sales floor consists of a video guide to a single line of products 1x per month.  The video is under 5 minutes long and is often missed by key staff members."
PetSmart,1cnp83t9j5j5f8n9,4.0,"Working at PetSmart was wonderful. I am passionate about animals and that was the perfect place for me. I did have some issues with hours and management but overall, a fun place to work if you love animals."
PetSmart,1cnnel02nas118oq,5.0,Great workers . Great bosses ! I will try to get back into a job with petsmart in the future if possible it’s a great experience and I love the environment of being with animals
PetSmart,1cnnb4qpaak5lat3,3.0,Okay for a high school person but not recommended for a adult person. Manager was great alway willing to help in store when needed . Benefits were good .
PetSmart,1cnn9irkq5j5fb4b,5.0,"PetSmart puts the pets first and that is important, but there are may policies and procedures to follow and the changing schedule can make for a stressful experience"
PetSmart,1cnlpob105ndke75,3.0,Your days will never be the same! You will have your Regs who come in monthly or weeky! You will be given the chance to be crossed trained but only do it if you can handle a fast pace!
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1cnkvq0lv52thbjb,5.0,"But some managers made it toxic to work there & petsmart's ""recovery"" tactics are a bit too much. You are often told owhen you have nothing to do to start recovering when there is no specific place to recover so you just go around the whole store recovering. Also you're always over worked and if tasks are not completed in said amount of time you get in trouble for it. That's with no side talks or distractions as well."
PetSmart,1cnks7ck4aqgt81a,2.0,they play favorites as well as if the manager is having a bad day they take it out on everyone around them also talk to you like you're a child. also if management has an issue with you they cut your hours. pay rate also sucks
PetSmart,1cnknjfg5aqgt8te,1.0,They want you on board to help because a previous employee quit last minute due to management not stopping other girls from harassing you. They don't get in trouble for talking bad about customers or there dogs which makes it difficult to stay engaged. The hours are up and down. They let high school games continue in the store even managment snap chats constantly on there phones while under paid employees are breaking there backs.
PetSmart,1cnkm6skjbrdfa09,5.0,The company...at least when I was there...was a fun place to worm.  Management stood behind their employees and were very helpful.  They gave you plenty of training for  your position and the pay was great.
PetSmart,1cnk8dbh65ndhdte,3.0,"I loved this job, and I loved the people I worked with.... but after having a medical issue that had to be dealt with I had issues with management and that made it a challenge to continue to work there."
PetSmart,1cnih17nn5n9hdi1,3.0,Really depends on who is running the store could be someone who is fair and treats everyone equally but there are more managers who have their favorites making the work place unfair.
PetSmart,1cngnlsgmb81kcg1,4.0,"Although I can't speak to every location, my Petsmart is a great place to work. Store management is helpful and friendly. I consider many of my coworkers and managers to be genuine friends. Corporate is a different story. All you need to do is Google the current debt and Moody rating of the company to see the numerous stories of Petsmart's current issues."
PetSmart,1cngcud5vb81ke36,5.0,"This pet store is great to work at because I get to help others in need to shop for their pets. Also, love all the animals that walks through the door. Best of all the peoples that work there are amazing."
PetSmart,1cngaluelb81kfh3,5.0,"great company, poor health benefit options and poor management. otherwise a decent place to be for a few years.The company doesn't really check into associates as much as they should."
PetSmart,1cnfpe7dg5j5cbme,4.0,"I worked at PetSmart for almost a year, and there were a few flaws, but overall it was a really nice place to work. Customers and coworkers were almost always friendly, and a majority of management I had was excellent. Would recommend to anyone as a part time job."
PetSmart,1cne21hgc52thc03,2.0,I have learned a lot about people and their pets and how to assist them with the problem at hand.  The employees are very easy to work with and friendly.
PetSmart,1cndp2t6bb89fa2k,3.0,A typical day at work was busy. I learned they don't care about the animals. The management needs improvement. The most enjoyable part was when I took time out to care for the animals.
PetSmart,1cndbte1i5ndhfn1,4.0,PetSmart was a good place to work part-time. I was able to pick the days or hours I was available and it paid decently well. It was a nice job to have while I was in school and interning.
PetSmart,1cnd73hbeas0sdp0,4.0,"I worked the evening shift from 1:30pm-9pm. I would come in, put my bag in my locker, and go into the play area Keep an eye on the dogs and play with them, pick up after them, make sure their water bowl are filled, and that all the dogs are getting along. You sat in the play camp from 1;30 until about 5 when they are taken back to their kennels for their dinner and we go to lunch. When we get back from break, we each take one side and let out the indi dogs one at a time for individual playtime (you'll learn about this when you start). After all dogs are walked and in their kennels, we spend the rest of the night cleaning. Usually, we can get all the indi dogs done about 7-ish and then we stay our the side we're on and clean all the kennels, suites, and playtime areas. Throughout the day, every hour or so, we go around checking on all the dogs and cats to make sure their kennels are clean and they have water. If their kennel is dirty, we clean up after them and replace their bedding if needed. And that's it. Easy work, chill coworkers, positive atmosphere."
PetSmart,1cncunbl0aqgt9e9,4.0,"I had to learn quickly how to multitask. I learned to be able to bathe my dogs and also handle walk in services for nails. I had to be quick on my feet, also having to keep the area clean. Being a bather I had to be cautious on aggressive dogs and had to stay out of their bite zone. I had no problem asking for help or advice whenever I felt uncomfortable."
PetSmart,1cncam3se5n9hc28,3.0,"The people i worked along side with were very easy to get along with, on the down side, management was very poor, which is the reason I left this job. Management in the store I worked at, lied about several things."
PetSmart,1cnc73r8iak9e9vb,1.0,"When I started, I was amazed at how supportive Petsmart was and how quickly I was booted up to a grooming position. I will always be thankful for the training I received there. I can get a job practically anywhere as a groomer. HOWEVER. In the short amount of time I was there (a year and a half), they went from being supportive to not caring at all about the employees. After all of the incidents happening with dogs dying and being injured, the employees became the enemy. Any little thing could get you in trouble and fired. We had a salon-wide meeting where they told us to consider that meeting our first verbal warning. Afterwards, any problems would automatically be a write up or go to HR and we were specifically told that HR loves to fire groomers on the spot. Petsmart thinks the customer is always right. ALWAYS. I was literally told that it didn't matter if I was being cursed at, threatened, whatever, that I had to bend over and take it. Some not so nice words were said in those meetings. Petsmart thinks they're doing everything they can to fix their problems, but everyone I know wants to leave as soon as their contracts are up."
PetSmart,1cnbvahh1akgrcml,1.0,Petsmart does not care for their employees. If you have a family they will suffer because you will never be home. Petsmart demands you work all holidays nights weekends. They will not work with you on your schedule. Only management gets to have nights weekends and holidays off. Petsmart does not compliment their employees when they have done a good job they just point out what your doing wrong all the time. I worked there for 4 years and the only reason I stayed that long is because the other groomers I worked with. This job is good for single people with no family.
PetSmart,1cnabrphg5j5cdqv,4.0,"I enjoyed my time working at PetSmart, making friends, and connections. I worked with I believe 5 managers  and worked well and in favor of all but the last.  It was a shame that my time trying to help people ant their families (pets included) was cut short(on my decision) for disagreements with management. Over all my time there was very enjoyable."
PetSmart,1cnaa6l7iak5h8ei,5.0,"great training, upper management was a pleasure to work with, loved working and training all of our store associates and customers. it was a challenge to learn how to take care of all the animals that where offered for sale."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1cn9nrmqfb85kc13,3.0,"PetSmart was, until a few years ago, a best in class place to work.  They had excellent training, succession and mentor programs.  Hiring was typically from within.  The company was successful most years.  Pay was decent and bonuses were quite good."
PetSmart,1cn9gqafcas0s8rf,2.0,"You get a lot of hours which is nice but the job you do is definitely worth more then 8.50.  And that was after a few ""raises"".  Managers will also call you at all hours to ask you to cover shifts for other employees who do not show up.  Its a fine starter job"
PetSmart,1cn7rb2q8aqgsfmk,5.0,Our days started as soon as we opened and ended at different shifts. We always worked as a team and made sure we all were a family and gave our best every shift we worked. Each summer we could get as much as 170 animals in our hotel at one time. We had our over night workers and then we had our normal day shifts and took turns with them and evening shifts. We also made sure all animals had the correct amount of care each day and night. There were also our extra coupon activities and sales each month. There would be picture times with animals and family and in front of fire place during Christmas and other ones for other holidays. WE ran a very clean and fun environment for all to appreciate every day. We took into  consideration any time a pet was lost or would get loose outside the hotel and made sure that we helped all guests with this or any other problem. Pet Smart Hotel is a very good place to shop and use for your pets and for your employment. Management is always helpful and the most difficult is crazy day camps or clean up time for pet or rooms. Being able to become a part of a pets life and their pet parents lives is very rewarding and the best part of the job. There is always new ways to care for the pets at Pet Smart Hotel and always directions to follow.
PetSmart,1cn7od3ucak5gbas,4.0,"I have a dog, 2 guinea pigs, and a mouse at home so naturally I fit right in to the atmosphere. I love animals and I'm that one crazy employee that talks to the pets before the people. The work load can be stressful when the store is busy because often times I can get things done pretty quickly."
PetSmart,1cn655mhias0rbkp,2.0,"Good place to work but extremely disorganized. Don’t train employees properly and struggle to keep everyone and everything organized. Also, need to keep track of applicants and alllications."
PetSmart,1cn4l98rh5n9g8oh,5.0,Great job to work at people are friendly and if you do your job everything will be easy depends on your work ethics but other then that I had fun there
PetSmart,1cn2a7abnak5fcg7,4.0,"Job is okay. People are plenty nice. The only real problem besides lack of hours is whoever does the inventory & ordering of product / supplies, is not doing a very good job. Some stuff is not order. A bunch of stuff keeps getting ordered that we have no room for."
PetSmart,1cn1rp7vtakgpe0l,3.0,The work you did was fun and fulfilling.
PetSmart,1cn0s8t01brddfq6,1.0,"please don't work here. management sucks, they don't care about their employees or their animals AT ALL. all petsmart cares about is making more money."
PetSmart,1cn01o3s8brddd88,5.0,My experience working at PetSmart so far is very positive. The Grooming Stylists and other Bathers always come to work with great energy and go out of their way to help the training employees such as myself. When it gets busy they never lose focus and always keep in mind the safety of the pet and make sure the per parent is happy with the result.
PetSmart,1cmvuv5ibakcq9t7,5.0,"Petsmart was an excellent company to work for. Given some of my physical limitations, I required a job that was accomodating and was not disappointed with my managers and fellow staff members (especially when I hurt myself and needed time off/a stool to sit in for medical reasons.)"
PetSmart,1cmvmmnnlakcq9g0,5.0,Family work environment and management was outstanding. If someone have any personal issues going on management would help that person in everyway possible if needed.
PetSmart,1cmu38r495n9fb1d,3.0,"I've been with this company a long time and the managers come and go. They're cutthroat with each other.  As long as you stay an associate you're fine. It's really hard to get full time, and if you do you have to have open availability.  There are good vacation and sick time for full time and the money is fair for retail, but you're not gonna get rich.  There's some pressure to sell (coupon books, upselling, etc) at the cashier level especially.  Again, the pressure depends on the manager.  It's nice to be around animals, it stinks to have to deal with angry customers and grumpy managers."
PetSmart,1cmtn1bcu52tf91p,3.0,"The work environment was not stressful, and the work given to my position required minimal effort. The practices of the company, such as the treatment policies for the animals were poor, but the associates took the liberty to give the animals proper treatment. The practices of the lead management towards the end of my services was very poor."
PetSmart,1cmt84mnuas0q829,5.0,"I learned a great deal while working for this company.  I learned how to properly care for many different types of animals, how to resolve customer issues in a professional manner, how to ask the right questions to ensure the customer got exactly what they needed, and it's where I got my first real experience in management. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the people I worked with."
PetSmart,1cmqbdgs25j5ae7r,5.0,"Management was usually good, work well with schedule. Coworkers are helpful, it was a laid back job on weekdays. Stressful on weekends. Customers were not usually hard."
PetSmart,1cmq4feiiakgpa3c,4.0,Great company to work for. If you like working in a distribution center then PetSmart is the place to work. It's a physical job but not a hard job at all.
PetSmart,1cmphdutaak9bca5,5.0,"The job is great. It can be stressful at times but, there’s a lot of cool down periods. The people are amazing and I love the atmosphere. Some people are not the nicest. However you get to feel accomplished after grooming the dogs and it’s just a very pat on the back job."
PetSmart,1cmpa78vtakcqah9,3.0,"After working there for many years it is very trying on your health asthmas, allergies, back and wrist pains have all developed. Some managers treat you like your replaceable and less than. WE are responsible for so many other responsibilities besides grooming pets and are only paid %50 of our commission."
PetSmart,1cmoiff59b89dadv,3.0,There is never a set schedule for anyone full-time. It seems there is more of a consideration for money than for the pets and employees' decisions rarely get backed up by their managers. There is no annual review unless your lucky and your job doesn't get changed without you knowing all the time.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1cmo8chdpb81iet7,2.0,"You don't leave a company, you leave bad managers, overall discounts for products was 15% occasionally you'd get 50% off some brands of dog food. was very happy when i had managers that cared and shared a mutual respect."
PetSmart,1cmnto44uakgpa4c,3.0,"I was on the Early morning shift Instock Team, stocking the building from 1am-8am, cashier helping customers with products, team building skills and good communication skills"
PetSmart,1cmm33r6lbrdb8pl,3.0,"If you're looking for a part time job with limited hours and you like animals, this job is for you! The petshotel is definitely the best department to work in. You get to play with dogs all day and there's limited interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1cmlqrqpgak5caec,3.0,"I work in the salon and it’s not what many people think it is. As an entry level bather it’s pretty difficult to have between 4-8 appointments and expect to do all the walk in services (mainly nail trims), but if you stick it out and become a groomer it’s pretty rewarding especially if you’re able to sell stuff. We get 50% of our sales so the more you hustle the better the pay check.  It gets chaotic on weekends when you’re trying to work on your appointment that you need done by a certain time while answering phones, checking in pets and taking them out, sweeping, etc.."
PetSmart,1cmlj4qvpakgn8tn,3.0,Everyone was great working with except the store manager who harassed everyone and made everyone's life very stressful til he got fired and replaced by someone who is even worse then he was. It would be a great environment if they didn't work there. It says something when 5 employees quit in a week.
PetSmart,1cmlfghdg52tcdgr,5.0,This was probably my favorite job in general. I have even thought about attempting to go back. I love working with animals and teaching people how to care for them once they become a pet parent.
PetSmart,1cmlegsfnak5ceac,5.0,The hardest part of the job is making sure you're accurate with your picking and trying to keep over a one hundred percent as well. Pet Smart provides a lot of incentives such as they put your name into a drawing to when a free pizza every month. They really take great care of their employees.
PetSmart,1cmlcqcv8b81geb1,4.0,"It was a full day, I was always alone in pet care. It sucks because it is a lot of work for one person, having at least two people on the job works so much better."
PetSmart,1cmjpkji3aqgpelu,3.0,Title says it all. Management fluctuates often. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone I know for the sure reason they would be let down. Pay is fair for my location
PetSmart,1cmjakrp852tcf49,5.0,"Loved working there and working with the animals and if i could go back i would, great place to work for and great people. and loved every single minute of it."
PetSmart,1cmj6j8dlaqgpahh,3.0,Working at Pet Smart was an excellent experience. Overall management was very helpful and knowledgeable of the warehouse. I was able to learn Pet Smart computer system.
PetSmart,1cmistshr5ndcb3g,5.0,"PerSmart is a great place to work. Very fun, great managers and employees. During the holidays they go all out. During Christmas we got a chipotle line and gifts bags."
PetSmart,1cmha37a85j54ecb,3.0,Do not expect to be promoted - management will lead you on and not follow up with promises. Management is typically hired from outside and not promoted from within.
PetSmart,1cmge594aakcka4g,4.0,fun job with flexible hours however pay is not consistent with others equal to your position and skipped out on raises promised to their some of the workers rather than others
PetSmart,1cmgar08sb81bb6h,1.0,"Working closely with the animals is very enjoyable. Management does not care about employees. They are not supportive, and do not acknowledge anything positive. They only focus on what you do wrong or need to improve on."
PetSmart,1cmfcj4pubrd79v2,4.0,"The group of people I worked with were great, but I didn't feel like I got real support from the managers. They change when they feel like following protocol or not."
PetSmart,1cmdh79p0ak94dsl,3.0,It was an excellent way of learning how to delegate tasks and manage time. My main downside however is that any mistakes are usually suffered by innocent animals that cannot help themselves.
PetSmart,1cmbt07225n97fr7,4.0,"Love bathing dogs and making sure they are comfortable. If you love pets, you are going to love it. But is not as easy as it would seen. It has been an eye opener for me. I have much respect for the groomers."
PetSmart,1cmb16h0hb81bbtb,4.0,Managers are friendly and understanding. Work hours are flexible and you can train on other departments. The best part is seeing cute dogs and other animals.
PetSmart,1cm9bs2fdaqglaa7,2.0,"Too much work for the liitle pay, to many rules that should not matter."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1cm8u97lnak57e3v,3.0,PetSmart has a wonderful work culture. Everyone is positive. The down side is that the wage is barely passable as living wage. Only full-time associates are able to support themselves in this work.
PetSmart,1cm8sq0vdak57du4,5.0,"The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting, 50 lb. bags of dog food, 50 lb. salt blocks.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet all kinds of animals.  The tarantula was not so much fun, but at least he was in a sealed container.  The wolf I met is probably the most beautiful animal I've ever seen.  I also got to ""work"" with the dog from Frasier, who was a real joy."
PetSmart,1cm8mcpgrak94fe8,3.0,Petsmart's goal is to treat every pet like our own. There was a lack of love and care for each animal and was about money instead. Do not recommend!!!
PetSmart,1cm8be7f7brd79bi,5.0,"scanning items then shipping them. scanning carts, loading the trucks, anything they wanted me to do . it is a big a warehouse. It was very hard work lifting up heavy."
PetSmart,1cm73r1g6b897a8c,3.0,Great stepping stone to receive knowledge about animal husbandry and customer service.
PetSmart,1cm68qsjcb857c3c,4.0,"A typical day at petsmart starts off slow,a few customers here and there. Stocking happens during any down time we get. The afternoon is usually the busiest. Before closing you make an announcement about how long till the store closes. We cash out our last customers locked the doors behind them shut our systems down. We then would put any returns we had where they belonged and then straightened the store up to expectations."
PetSmart,1cm63bt47akchbl4,4.0,"Petsmart is not for those not willing to put in the work.  While the pay is...adequate, every position in the warehouse outside of leadership or clerk positions are hard labor."
PetSmart,1cm6345ghak54egn,4.0,"Very fast paced work place. You're under a time limit to groom your pet and you have multiple that come in at the same time sometimes. I learned how to properly and safely groom pets. Salon manager wasn't the best, but the job was fun. The hardest part of the job was pleasing the manager but the most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfied customers. Over all it was a good company to work for."
PetSmart,1cm5rmm5hb817clq,3.0,"Pet Care department is super fun to work in, but management is in way no professional. They pick favorites and treat employees unfairly. Policies tend to be broken and management is lazy."
PetSmart,1cm5rei6g52t4bae,5.0,Petsmart was a lovely temporary job for me when I first moved here to Atlanta.  I enjoyed the fast-paced work place and was able to use my excellent customer service skills while assisting and educating pet customers.
PetSmart,1cm5nkdp352t4f37,2.0,I learned more about customer service and how to deal with tough decision making in a short matter of time. I also learned how to bathe dogs and do a haircut based on parents needs and wants.
PetSmart,1cm5fn2pcak91dne,2.0,"Too many meetings, too many changes in management, too many different management styles. No freedom to work as your own person and product quality work. To CLEAR expectations when projects are given out which causes 3, 4, sometiems 5 itterations of the same thing. Working around pets sounds good until you are really trying to work and there is no peace and quiet."
PetSmart,1cm3hoursb85685m,4.0,No ability to move up. Almost 3 years and there was no help to try to get a higher position or learn more. They would rather hire someone new than teach.
PetSmart,1cm1keilo1bgf0ro,4.0,"Petsmart slow and fast paced depending on the day, great for experience. Rarely anyone gets full time, however, low pay and few hours make cost of living difficult."
PetSmart,1cm19a2e91bgf392,3.0,"As a groomer I am encouraged to over book myself, take in difficult and biting dogs then berated for being over booked and bitten. Often put into unsafe situations and even after making outside management aware of the breaches in policy nothing changes"
PetSmart,1cm17f8ve5nd38d0,4.0,"PetSmart is really great for those who are in college. The only con that I would say is that the wage is the bare minimum and not a living wage. Depending on your management, you will get the schedule you ask for. Due to school, I requested to only work the weekends and will fill in during the weekdays if needed, and that's exactly what they gave me which is nice."
PetSmart,1cm0e622taqghbfd,1.0,"terrible place to work in Fayetteville, worked 50 + hours a week and was asked to do it off the clock. the Rats were so bad we had to clear food off shelves, rats would run right out in front of people. CEL left dead hamsters in a box on the dock to hide her error of them getting out and caught in rat traps. ="
PetSmart,1cm0assmg5j50ekl,5.0,They provide a great training program and a self advancing environment. There is lots of room for advancement. The people that work there are great to work with.
PetSmart,1cludr7365j4tf19,5.0,"Really cares for employees, customers, and any animals that come in the door. Wonderful company with wonderful people. Would highly recommend working for PetSmart to anyone looking for a beginner job."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1clu10jrcbrd0cj3,2.0,This place was a good place to work while starting a family and working your way through college but was not a long term career for me. It was very labor intensive work and was not always ideal.
PetSmart,1clsmrsfub813b96,5.0,"I was hired on to work two separate summers here and would definitely go back again. They were really flexible with my hours and were willing to give me the shift that worked best for me. I generally had 30 hours or more as it was normally busy but if I needed less because I was busy they were able to redistribute my shifts easily. My managers were kind and attentive so I never felt that I couldn't approach them if I needed something. The environment could get stressful at times but mostly it was nice to get a few hours with the animals and then focus on the nitty-gritty. Overall, I would recommend PetSmart to others looking for a part-time job where they can advance and gain skills fairly quickly. It was a wonderful place to work."
PetSmart,1clsl2jamak8s9a5,3.0,"I love the co-workers and the pets. The store provides free lunches. The chances for advancement in the company are rare and you must be patient. The raises were annual and barely covered cost of living changes. If you were low balled in the beginning, it is very difficult to make a lot of money."
PetSmart,1clschol25nd0ao9,5.0,If you like to work with animals this is the job for you!  It is very fast paced but fun! They will train you on different levels and is easy to move up with the company.
PetSmart,1clrgevlu52t0878,5.0,"Working here is a fun thing to do, Everyone is so friendly, Managers are friendly, work hours are flexible. You get to see all kinds of animals. Including Pigs. I would definitely work here again. I would suggest this as your first job, Must be 18 to work here."
PetSmart,1clr62uoq5j4tcsq,5.0,This is by far the best first job that anyone could ever have. I 100% love this place from the people to the management even the higher ups have respect for everyone that is here.
PetSmart,1clq7u5r01bgc0us,3.0,"I enjoy working at petsmart because I'm always learning something. Learning new things is exciting to me, but the management is very poor. Managers can be lazy, and they play favoritism to certain associates and I think it's unfair."
PetSmart,1clpe583sak50d6u,4.0,"I enjoy working at PetSmart but they do not have competitive pay rates and i do not feel every employee is paid as fairly as they should be.  Being a retailer, the bottom line is more money for corporate"
PetSmart,1clp365kq1aht13p,5.0,"Working at petsmart is a very fun and social place to be, you get to interact with all the different breeds of dogs and there owners and find out how they blend in with the families and there temperments."
PetSmart,1clp342d41bae4ks,1.0,"Not only are the production expectations ridiculously high, the new hire turnaround is jaw dropping. Not to mention, the new hires that were making more than me to start, after my fourth year of employment, when they raised the base pay to try and stay competitive with the businesses in the surrounding area. The problems that existed before I started working there were exactly the same as when I left 4 1/2 years later. I was constantly berated by and written up by managment for these problems. By far, the worst place I've ever worked and I was a package handler at FedEx ground during the holiday season."
PetSmart,1clp320g5b853ebi,3.0,"It was an alright place to work, I worked the weekend shift so I worked 3 days and had 4 days off. The schedule was perfect but the job itself was boring and repetative."
PetSmart,1cln1q8001aht7ub,2.0,"I enjoyed working with the animals, but you were not given enough time for the daily duties. It could be considered a stressful environment. Customer service for the most part was good, but when people did not want to adhere to the advice given and then came back and complained made it for a sad day"
PetSmart,1clmav4fi1aic3b4,2.0,"It was a very stressful job at times, very quick paced and most days tended to be short staff with working staff members having to pick up the remainder of the responsibilities on top of doing their own tasks."
PetSmart,1clmaftm81aht3j5,5.0,"I like work culture, nice place to learn new technologies, management is soo nice, enjoyed work with the whole team. there is no hardest part in PetSmart."
PetSmart,1clkfopo51bgc7qk,1.0,"While working at PetSmart, I was belittled as an employee and blamed for management mistakes. I was also expected to do my own job as well as pick up the slack of others. I was injured on the job twice and never received any sort of compensation and was expected to lift dogs upwards of 100 lbs by myself."
PetSmart,1clicahc052sv9i4,5.0,The fes problems i had was with the hours it wasnt nearly enough and when i tried to transfer to a diffrent store the other manager wouldnt return my calls and i had to constantly call back to to talk to someone
PetSmart,1cliafi605ncvenn,4.0,This job was the most fun job i have ever had.
PetSmart,1cli6ncdbak4vcel,3.0,Management was decent but they did not want to deal with conflict and the other employees working at the store were absolutely horrible and unmotivated.
PetSmart,1clhoal4nbrcvehg,2.0,Management needs to figure themselves out. Rules change from week to week. Focus changes from week to week and we get scolded when we didnt meet whatever they decide to look at. Schedule is a mess. Been with the company 8 years. You only get promoted if management likes you. I've trained people who are now assistant store managers and store managers. But no advancement for me.
PetSmart,1clhe4f8j1bgb5m1,4.0,"Friendly people, made a lot of friends. Job can be fun some days. Slow summers, very busy winters. Many opportunities to try different job functions. Regular breaks. 4 days a week. Par pay. Despite it's flaws, I recommend giving it a shot."

PetSmart,1clh4qjgfak4vdou,1.0,"Pay is unfair, management can be unfair, pet vendors are cruel, don’t pay enough for the amount of work they make you do. Make inexperienced people take care and give medicine to animals."
PetSmart,1clg42kbl5j4sd6a,1.0,"I guess it is understandable that there is going to be a lot of drama in the grooming salons because there's just a bunch of GIRLS, but when your managers are the ones that start it and worsen it, it's just ridiculous. I have worked at THREE salons and ALL of the managers were terrible. All three were petty and bullies. The managers outside of the salon are equally as terrible. Just completely disrespectful. I've seen a manager be so disrespectful to an employee they quit on the spot, then bad mouthed them to the other employees. It's like you have to fight to not be walked all over. Higher ups don't care about you either. You can go to HR about bulling, or anything serious for that matter, and nothing will be done. You can have these managers straight up sexually harass people, curse you out, break a serious policy on camera, ALL with witnesses, and nothing will be done. This company really does not care about you. They will just throw you under the bus and then ask why you can't work after being run over."
PetSmart,1clfe3qlmak8r854,4.0,"I held my job at Petsmart for a year until I had to leave for school. I had amazing coworkers although I did not get along with one of the managers. Overall, it’s a great job to get customer service experience and paid the bills while I was in school."
PetSmart,1clepl6jdb88v8m1,4.0,"Working as a stock associate at PetSmart was a great first job. I learned a lot and improved in many ways. Attention to detail was very important as I had to make sure products were stocked correctly, neatly, and before the store opened."
PetSmart,1cleot3685j4sfgs,5.0,Everyone is so nice! they are all concerned for you and go out of their way to help you out to succeed! Close knit family atmosphere. Both managers are awesome!
PetSmart,1clen5kvbb852eo0,3.0,The environment in the store is very welcoming. Its a nice calm environment to be in. The management needs to better organize the store. Nice associates
PetSmart,1clelsrcl1aib1bj,1.0,God people working calm passed friendly environment no problems with no one just sometimes had bad costumers coming to the store but everything pretty much good
PetSmart,1clda0pu51bab798,3.0,I worked for Petsmart for three and a half years and was trained in all roles.
PetSmart,1clcn256pak8pbad,3.0,Great place to work if you can handle the stress of the day to day things. I loved my job at petsmart as a groomer but the salon manager was not the best person. She was constantly cutting the dogs and was very conniving.
PetSmart,1clcjpd6l52srbel,3.0,"Was there off and on for 5 years. No raises, no moving up. I worked over all the time and no getting over 20 hours a week. The discounts were good and flexible hours. I trained as a bather as well and still did not ever get full time hours. It is a great job for part time but you can not move up! I am diabetic and my sugar was getting low. They made me wait an hour before I could even eat something. I was furious! They kept saying I had to wait on another manager to come in, knowing they had someone to cover my break. If you do not work over 6 hours you get no break!"
PetSmart,1clci31m3ak4sfhr,4.0,I managed a PetSmart before it went private. I cannot say what the culture and work is like today. But it was amazing pre-buyout. The employee turnover was nonexistent.
PetSmart,1clchenap5n8rasa,5.0,This was an excellent place to start out at and learn new stuff from. A laid back job and definitely friendly place with work for. I worked here for 6 year and will miss it
PetSmart,1clc8f4u6b88tebk,3.0,"Working at PetSmart did give me much insight about customer service and about the animals I had to work with there. However, the management at my particular store was not great, and it seemed not very well organized. I wasn't getting the hours I wanted and my paychecks could not have paid my bills whatsoever."
PetSmart,1clamhp4cb810dfg,4.0,This is a Great place to work out if you like lifting and bending your knees as well as quick paced and the  smell of dog food  and ready to work 10+ hours a night.
PetSmart,1claadke4b80k94v,5.0,"This job is a great place to work, the managers are friendly, there is a lot of room for advancement. The pay is good and the health insurance is a decent price."
PetSmart,1cla52eeu1bg34b2,4.0,Good work environment and managers are pretty great most of the time.  The best part of the job is the animals that come through.  Customers tend to be nice and the work is sometimes fast-paced but there is a strong teamwork environment so you're never alone if you're struggling.
PetSmart,1cl9qrgs4b84ka4n,3.0,"Even the part time employees are stressed and they don't have to endure as many hours as the full time. In fact they aren't really allowed to work more than 28 hours or face consequences which isn't nearly enough to live off of. The ultimate problem here is that cooperate comes out with something new every three months to hound managers about. The managers can't make those goals and face consequences which are then turned onto the employees, who may not have been aware of the issue to begin with, stress levels rise, people get less excited about working, and as a result we deal with grumpy customers because we have grumpy employees. Most employees are not properly trained and instead are just thrown out onto the floor to figure things out on their own (which is not a good tactic in the bird, small animal, and fish department). Every year the training programs get shorter and shorter to provide even less because the turn over rate is absolutely horrible due to how employees just can't handle how stressful it is. It's a vicious cycle. No matter how determined you are to change these ways or make something better, you will be broken."
PetSmart,1cl9n6cqm1bg37lp,3.0,This was a fun place to work. The pay was good for a reatil establishment.  Management was not the best. Hours varied a lot. And not much career growth from this company.
PetSmart,1cl9e8dg95j4lebr,5.0,"My shifts at PetSmart usualy go by fast. Sometimes, I'll have another cahsier working with me so I can put returns aways and clean up. Its pretty laid back."
PetSmart,1cl8c9nu85j4ld1u,3.0,"I enjoy working with the animals and helping the pet parents make their pets happy. Overall PetSmart is a great place to work for a retail job. I feel they should give more overtime opportunities and give fair raises on hard work, not favoritism. Majority of my team are fair and hard working individuals. IT is also a nice welcoming environment that judges you on your work ethic not your appearance, race, or ethnicity and I love that as well."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1cl8a9usa52snat4,3.0,Great place to work whenever you remove poor management. Very employee friendly and follows through with benefits provided. Any position held within the store is an opportunity to gain ample amounts of knowledge concerning the pet world.
PetSmart,1cl7gbsvobrcic24,5.0,great company.  they take care of all of the associates.  the work is hard but if you have a good team it is easy to get it done.  i suggest people to work there.
PetSmart,1cl7cjjivbrci8pa,4.0,"Not a bad place to have your first job at, management was great and they worked around my class schedule. Working animals was nice but after a while the slow pace got too much to handle."
PetSmart,1cl52vt251bg36b9,5.0,"Petsmart was a great job, however I am looking to become a salon lead/manager and they aren’t hiring, that is why I am looking to find a new job. I am wanting to advance with my job."
PetSmart,1cl4t182s1ahk451,1.0,"upper management changes too often and then you are left trying to change work working patterns to try and be better suited for new management, it was always about proofing to the next guy that you  deserved the job you currently have"
PetSmart,1cl4ld3nq1ahk1a2,5.0,"How can you go wrong working with animals? Although stressful sometimes this was a fun job. You never knew what you were going to see walk in the doors. Dogs, cats, lizards, pigs, etc. A really interesting place to work."
PetSmart,1cl47jn605ncn87g,3.0,"Within this company, you experience a friendly and welcoming work environment. Not to mention the pets! Since I've been working inside the hotel, I go to work everyday with a smile, mostly because pets are my passion."
PetSmart,1cl40gi6s5ncnd6o,3.0,"If you love pets, it's a cool retail job. Other than that it's not worth it. The pay is far too low to live on in NYC. As with most retail jobs, it's only worth living here if you have some other financial support"
PetSmart,1cl365b9n1ahk1dv,5.0,"Working at Petsmart has been a very fun and fulling job. I love working with both the pets and the pet parents. I am type person of who loves all animals, so finding a job where I can take care of them is a nice thing to have, it feels like I'm doing what I love."
PetSmart,1cl323om15n8nfrr,3.0,"Difficult at first, since I had no formal training. A few things I was just thrown into and expected to learn on my own. Thankfully great staff and managers who helped teach you the tricks of the trade, when available."
PetSmart,1cl2stilmak8kb2h,2.0,"It was pretty awful, I wanted to become a groomer and was told every month this month would be the month! They waited until I started my college semester and wanted me to stop mid semester to go to grooming school, when I said I couldn't take off class mid semester I was told I wasn't serious enough about it as a career. One year down the drain being lied to, gossiped about, and overall cheated."
PetSmart,1cl2neeqj1ahk3b5,5.0,I have been learning a lot from my coworkers and been receiving good  feedback and training. Everyone is friendly and helpful. Enjoy working with dogs alot.
PetSmart,1cl2mfepbb80kbi5,5.0,"pet-smart as a whole wants you to grow within their organization, they want to see you move up and grow. the bather life is stressful because the shop and shop manager expects you to perform 11 tasks at one time"
PetSmart,1cl2lkqoa1ahk5dd,4.0,"when I was first hired management was terrific. they then switch that management to different locations and brought in all new management. who treat the employees horribly, abuse their position of power and have absolutely no idea what their doing overall! Extremely frustrating as an employee who formerly used to love their job."
PetSmart,1cl27849hb88iauc,2.0,"From day one, there were issues and things were always changing and I was never told until it was too late. I did not enjoy working here at all. All they cared about was their numbers and didn't care about the well being of their staff."
PetSmart,1cl271o6bb80kci2,4.0,"Very animal friendly and animal oriented. Every employee is there to help pets and their owners find and receive the best quality of health possible. Management trains employees continuously on animal health products, tips, and tricks, especially to share with owners to achieve the best results for the pet."
PetSmart,1cl20rv8iak4nej4,4.0,A typical day at PetsMart was pretty medium paced. I learned a lot about stocking and dates while I was there. the management was fair and very helpful when needed. there really wasn't a hard part with the job there was goal set though.
PetSmart,1cl1vomhsak4n9sm,4.0,"On a store level, Pet Smart is really fun and a great workplace, But in recent times,corporate has made some moves that work against productivity and pets health, by taking time from the pet and placing it on the customer we have suffer more pet lost than any other year due to this change in policies."
PetSmart,1cl03nbk8ak8kdi2,1.0,"In the salon you aren't paid enough for the type of work. Also, the manager will cut your hours randomly. The manager doesn't follow your availability and she will yell at you if you aren't available enough."
PetSmart,1ckvu4469brcidit,3.0,Its a fun place to work and the best part of the day is when friend pups roll through. The compensation is good for high school/ college students but no where near enough for someone out.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1ckve51f0akgl912,4.0,PetSmart is good about letting their employees move from department to department to find their own niche. Efficiency could be better at PetSmart but I believe that starts from above just the store's influence.
PetSmart,1ckvdq04mb80kfqu,3.0,The job was overall a fun environment. The animals were wonderful and entertaining to work with. The employees were not as fun and entertaining to work with but overall bearable.
PetSmart,1ckutlb8j52snaae,2.0,The management jobs at petsmart have gotten tougher due to the increased pressure to compensate for less and less customers walking through the door.  Burn out factor is high.
PetSmart,1cktaj5o6brcie26,2.0,under staffed which leaves a lot of pressure on you (even if part time).
PetSmart,1ckt02ik45n8nftt,5.0,I loved working there and learning new things all about the animals and also getting to relate to the customers I honestly enjoyed it but I would much rather be working where I attended to be
PetSmart,1cksqdq1r5ncnd1l,3.0,"When I first started my job at PetSmart I was incredibly excited to work there because I love animals, and I couldn't wait to take care of them. As time went by I realized that a lot of my co-workers wouldn't do their jobs properly and all of their slack would be left for me to do, and I felt like I was always under-estimated. So many customers would come in and talk about their negative past shopping experiences there because the employees were rude and disrespectful to them, but they would always say how helpful I was and always thanked me. I learned how to take care of many different types of animals, and that was the most enjoyable part of my job. If it wasn't for some of the rude and incompetent co-workers, I would still be there because I love animals."
PetSmart,1cksbiihaak8ke9r,5.0,My manager was great with working with my college schedule. The only reason I stayed at this job was for the flexible scheduling and my great coworkers.

PetSmart,1ckqf8gt9ak4h8p5,4.0,you start out as a bather and hopes that you can move up to groomer but you really have to patience at this job and understand sometimes they play favorites
PetSmart,1ckq64bip5n8j9a9,3.0,"hardest part of the job, is the rollover in team members, store leaders and district leader. I had 4 DL in 4 years. Work place culture was a good one. most enjoyable part of job was interactions with pets that came into store."
PetSmart,1ckpt9cep1ahv3cc,5.0,"If you love animals its a great place to be. Work environment was great. had good hours, time off. When i worked there i enjoyed the environment well. The employees were nice and helpful when I first started."

PetSmart,1ckohqirl1aif3ek,5.0,"This is the best job I have ever had. My management team COULD NOT be better.  My work environment is steadily paced, I get to interact with pets all day, all jobs are relatively easy, flexible hours, my coworkers are like my extended family. Company has good values."
PetSmart,1ckoh9adt1d1f531,3.0,"The managers were here and there, never really taught you enough to advance, but that's really all that comes with being a stocker. Thankfully my co-worker was helpful enough to teach me things and make the job worth while."
PetSmart,1cknl219ib80hfem,5.0,Its a great place to work. The people are all wonderful and the managers are extremely relaxed. I was only minimum wage worker so unfortunately there weren't very many career advancements for me.
PetSmart,1ckngbi3e5n8ja0v,3.0,"If you like caring for animals it can be good, but unless you move up the pay is pretty low, even then not that high paying. And some employees did not take care of the animals as best as possible."
PetSmart,1ckn5evjcb84hd8t,2.0,In our area the mgmt is terrible or it would be a good company. I worked my way up over three years and when I was MIL I wasn't even given the hours assigned by the company from my store leader to do the massive monthly resets leaving every week stressful and me having to do them during the day while I was running the store and helping customers. Very frustrating. The upper MGMT does not care about it's employees since the company was sold 3 years ago.
PetSmart,1ckmo1p195j4hdn0,3.0,"It was alright. It paid little to nothing, really busy(I was sweating half the time), and all the groomers back stabbed each other’s for more expensive pets. It’s very easy to get promoted from a dog bather to a groomer(they send you to their academy). I chose not to because I was going to school for something not in that field at all. A lot of drama goes on because you’re in a enclosed small space all day with deadlines crawling up and the salon is usually filled with women, so everyone has high emotions. On the upside you get to play with dogs and puppies all day and when you’re not stressed you’re just chilling, hanging out. It was a fun job. I only left because I found a job in the medical field."
PetSmart,1ckm7dg2u1baf7kc,5.0,"Not only was the management great, but the co-workers all got along with one another and we were provided with a safe and fun working environment. I wish I could have stayed longer. The starting pay was also reasonably good."

PetSmart,1cklqd5iab80hfso,4.0,Playing with all the live animals will keep you from getting your work done.
PetSmart,1ckljbc2p1aif0uu,5.0,I really enjoyed working at PetSmart.   The people who work there really care about animals and as the store Pet Trainer I was able to work with a large variety of dogs.  I was a great experience.
PetSmart,1cklaqtcfb84h86r,5.0,I would probably still there had it not been for my husbands job changing. It was a fun upbeat face paced job. All the things I enjoy. Everyone working seemed to be happy to be working. It was a great environment.
PetSmart,1ckl1jgaf1fdv3pq,2.0,"The people you work with are great, the management however is young and inexperienced. The professionalism between directors and Vice Presidents has great potential for improvement as they are all young and young in their positions. There is a reputation for a revolving door among all departments, and yes that is true, which makes business very hard to run. The departments are constantly changing roles, without communication, causing either double work or something to slip through the cracks. It can be a great company to work for, there just needs to be better more experienced/mature leadership and consistent direction."
PetSmart,1ckksib1s1baf0fs,3.0,"really only good if you need a job during college. not much of a work/life balance, management is never consistent, and there are so many unnecessary policies that make doing your job almost impossible."
PetSmart,1ckkpft5o52sj9ds,3.0,"I worked at petsmart for 6 months in the doggie day camp as a pet care specialist. During the doggie day camp, the workers would have to stand in a room for 3 hours with either big or small dogs. The workers would pick favorites and didn't give the person standing in the room a choice to be with the big or small dogs. Also, we weren't really allowed to play or throw toys with the dogs because of fear of a dog fight, so there are no real activities done with the dogs. For the most part, you just stand in a room for 3 hours straight until they let the dogs out of the room. Communication was not very good and we communicated through a cheap walkie talkie. Also, workers aren't trained enough to be in a room with dogs that need attention. Sometimes workers don't know what to do or what to give a dog because they don't train workers. Overall, management was bad, there is little to no training involved, and the dogs are not treated very good."
PetSmart,1ckk206nk1fdv7gb,4.0,I was not an experience dog bather when I first started. But I was very interested when I went in with a friend to have her dog bathed. So the manager of PetSmart so my interest and told me to put in an application. I did I got hired and I rather enjoyed it. The dogs also liked my long manicure nails that was how I massage them when I bathe them
PetSmart,1ckjhb8m11ahd2s2,5.0,Company goal was always animals come first but they don’t. A life is a life to me especially pets. The manager refused to treat a sick Guinea pig that ended up dieing and all managers turned there backs when I was getting lied about by my co workers.
PetSmart,1ckjek4l052sj8de,3.0,"Like most retail stores these days, it's often understaffed and associates and managers are expected to do more than the hours they are given. Also, regardless of how it's presented in an interview, sales and metrics drive the culture. There is a lot of pressure to sell, even though it's camouflaged under the guise of customer service. Managers above the store level (district, regional, corporate) are obsessed with the ""scorecard"" metrics largely because they receive hefty bonuses if targets are met or exceeded. Same goes for store level management. Part-time, and non management associates receive no reward for their hard work in helping achieve those goals (other than ""thank you"" cards that may lead to them being ""associate of the month"", for which there is no financial reward)."
PetSmart,1ckjbqgt7b80h910,3.0,"The petsmarts in Oregon that I worked at were great! They cared about the animals more than sales. But when I transferred to Washington, the Petsmarts here are very opposite. I saw so many things that made me cringe. That is why I left."
PetSmart,1ckj45jru52sjcl7,4.0,Petsmart is a productive place to work but it is also a fun place to work. They have a great schedule with associates working 3-4 days a week. Starting pay is $13 depending on the department you are in
PetSmart,1ckj1uij61d1f6of,2.0,The job itself is not bad but the poor management skills are horrible. they did not give me enough hours at all. I worked 8 hours one day and then 2 weeks later they finally decided to give me ANOTHER 8 hours.
PetSmart,1ckj13heh1baf5c0,5.0,I loved working a PetSmart.  My co-workers there truly loved animals and were fun to be around.  I gained a lot of valuable experience while studied to get my CPDT-KA certification.
PetSmart,1ckibfqmi1ahv09b,5.0,"10 hour shifts required to pick dog bags, cat bags, liter, toys ect. Some days lifting up to 50 lbs every other order. Really an amazing company to work for"
PetSmart,1ckibell4ak4hcqn,3.0,"it definitely was a lot of physical work being in the pet department. Lots of demands and we would have occasional visitors that would judge our store and they were very picky. This always caused a lot of stress among all the workers. Otherwise, it was a laid back place. I loved my team and the people I worked with."
PetSmart,1ckgl2tf61ahv65d,5.0,Petsmart taught me all I know! They were hands on with training and kept us on our toes for sure! everyone was nice to work with. The only downfall was the lack of space in the back with so many groomers working at once as well as lack of dryers and tubs! Working with friendly  people makes the days go by faster!
PetSmart,1ckgg63dn1ahv2ks,3.0,It’s retail what more could you ask for. Not great not bad. Pay is normal and nothing special or exciting. It’s a job and that’s about all it is and will be
PetSmart,1ckge53g8ak4hf4t,4.0,"I got the job I applied for. Management really cared about the people and pets we serviced on a daily basis. I would definitely refer recent highschool grads or college students to this job,"
PetSmart,1ckfr5jpnb84h9ns,4.0,"I haven't worked there in a long time, but when I did finally leave the company, they were a lot less fun to work for. They used to have a ""family"" feel to it, then the corporate greed took over."
PetSmart,1ckflv0ik1aif01s,3.0,"The management is nice and accommodating to your personal schedule. However, the pay is on the lower side and there isn't really and growth opportunities in the stores."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1cke5nrgn0mct1vg,3.0,I was a stand up reach truck driver i started off as an order selector then moved up a replenishment driver it was climate control great people but they pay people by who they like the most not by production.
PetSmart,1cke2bqei1bab1ij,1.0,"Would not recommend this job. Attended school part time while working part time, management was not very flexible with my school schedule unfortunately. I enjoyed working with the animals,yet I wish was given more training. Overall don't recommend."
PetSmart,1ckbu5tjr1d1b2em,3.0,"A typical day includes working with dogs, starting with a bath, doing their nails, ears, and brushing them out. Also, it includes making appointments for people on a computer. I liked my management, but some people are holding on too long and need to retire. What is driving me away is coworkers that are trying to stir up drama with everyone because she thinks she is higher than everyone else."
PetSmart,1ckasrr181d1b1lc,5.0,I loved this job and the team that I worked with. I would recommend this position to anyone who asks. However I had to leave due to poor management making it hard to keep my position. With constant changes to the schedule on a day to day basis without warning. It became an issue and I left the company.
PetSmart,1ckalgthj1d0s6j7,5.0,A typical day was fast paced and stressful but it was all to take care of the animals. The job required you to think on your toes and to pay attention to the animals at all times.
PetSmart,1ckahlcop1ags7dr,4.0,Keeping up with as many as 17 dogs in any of the three day camps at hotel is physically demanding.  It is intense to keep dogs from too rough a play or an actual fight.
PetSmart,1ck9tt0ku1d0s41f,5.0,"I enjoyed my time with PetSmart as a professional bather. I will say I was going into it as just another job.I quickly found myself in my in love with the position, and enjoyed doing my job"
PetSmart,1ck9oe8g21fdp4ti,3.0,"This job is a typical retail job, working as a petcare associate, you must learn extensive knowledge of all pets and products. The management often contradicts themselves and expects far too much from associates while not doing much, themselves, or lying about new work policies to make their own lives easier. The scheduling is frustrating due to the fact that there are constant errors and the hours are unpredictable; one week you may get 30 and another you may get 15. It definitely doesn't provide a stable or steady weekly pay rate and doesn't take into account your requested amount of hours per week. Budget cuts and new work policies do not fall hand in hand, leaving the associates to scramble to find a proper work routine, which isn't made any easier by the fact that everyday is a skeleton crew. You must expect the worst each day because of all this PLUS the fact that the customers are absolutely atrocious."
PetSmart,1ck9fjqpu1d0r4mi,5.0,Always fully stocked and very knowledgeable of nutrition.associates are friendly and very welcoming. Management is ready to train new hires. Pets are welcomed by there name. Grooming salon is clean and groomers are great and very patient.
PetSmart,1ck9bniuj1ba929f,5.0,"Working at Petsmart is a great job, and you become very good at multitasking and helping more than one person at one time. Petsmart is a friendly place that welcomes all types of customers."
PetSmart,1ck99sr4d1d0r7bo,5.0,"Loved working for petsmart, got alot of experience handling dogs and learning how to hygienically care for them as a bather. However I believe the pay was bad from all the responsibilities required for the job."
PetSmart,1ck91bgrt1ahb6pu,4.0,"Understaffed mornings are the norm. Don't expect to leave your area much, even to get your break, because there is no one to cover you. Most pet parents are great, watch out for the obviously over the top ones, because management wont rescue you from crazy, irate, or downright abusive guests."
PetSmart,1ck8fkppg1fdo1fh,2.0,"The animals make the job worth it. I worked in the Hotel section. Walking and playing with dogs that were here for daycare or boarding. A lot of cleaning is done to keep everyone and animal safe and healthy. Always on your feet, walking/standing on concrete leads to constant joint pain."
PetSmart,1ck84e8361ba902j,2.0,"Began well, then over the course of 3 years of  working the store went through I believe it was 5 general managers.  People were brought in from other stores promised positions they were never given and forced to work extra duties that were under their pay grade.  Started at 9 an hour and at the end of my 3 yrs there I made 9.99 because 10.00 is apparently far too much.  Seniority, skill, work ethic, and so much more mean absolutely nothing to them all that matters is that less than the bare minimum of workers doing everything in 1/4 of the time needed to attempt the tasks.  Making one person, maybe a second put away an entire semi trailer worth of pet food/goods/etc.  in less than 3 hours time while also cleaning the entire store.  Employees are forced to absorb the responsibilities of sometimes 3 or 4 positions in the store due to management's lack of hiring the appropriate amount of employees."
PetSmart,1ck7p3kpq1d0r7hf,3.0,Address urgent emails
PetSmart,1ck6jjhfp1ba31tq,2.0,"Upper Leadership over Salon Leaders usually don’t have experience in salon operations. Training for the Salon Leadership position is 33-40hr depending on how fast you can read and take test. The training lacks with a “Sink or Swim” timeline and guidance from the store leadership team usually can’t help from that lack of education. Salons usually have a high staff turnover, causing a domino effect of added stress, budget spending, time spent away from required Leadership duties, training standards effected which all can develop poor salon culture. Poor salon performance is then blamed on Salon Leaders Leadership which then leads to  discipline action."
PetSmart,1ck4ei1bp1d030oe,4.0,Petsmart is super fun! You get to see animals all day long and they are very flexible with your hours! Everyone is very professional and they all love their jobs.

PetSmart,1ck34ged81agn5lc,3.0,"Store level and Upper management tends to have a chip on their shoulders and never listen to the needs of their associates. Petsmart use to care for their employees but now its all about the money and ""the customer is always right"" motto is too much to deal with at times. Customers yell, curse and threaten you but at the end of the day whatever they say goes! I never had time to myself even when I was off the clock! Medical benefits and LOA procedures are ridiculous and shameful."

PetSmart,1ck2lc8980mtm2mq,3.0,Concern for safety high due to liability. Careless about staff quality of work in favor of numbers. Considered income more valuable than working conditions. Management talks around you rather than listens.
PetSmart,1ck229j8l1ahk1cd,4.0,"It is a fast paced job, there's always something to do but interacting with the animals made it worth it. I was crossed trained in everything so my hours fluctuated, there were some short shifts as well as long shifts but over all had fun."
PetSmart,1ck173tg61ahk5io,5.0,I would love this job again. I loved helping people out and helping with the pets. Everything was so nice and all the people that came in were amazing people.
PetSmart,1ck0kruvs1d0316b,2.0,A typical day here is full of stress. Usually overbooked and struggling to get through the day. On a day with clients you already know it does go well. Usually days like those go by like a breeze. Working in the grooming salon is much like being in high school. The most enjoyable part is working with the dogs and seeing how happy customers can be. Plus they tip!
PetSmart,1ck0iq4p70mtm63g,4.0,"I was a bather in the grooming salon and cashier on the sales floor. I loved working with the different dogs in the salon. Getting paid to bathe and play with dogs was great. That said, the store manager was an obnoxious little 20 year old who kept telling people how to do their jobs, when she didn't even know how to do her own."
PetSmart,1ck07ierl1d0j30j,3.0,It has been a constant battle to have hours to live off of. They always worked with my school schedule but corporate doesn't care about its employees.
PetSmart,1cjv1q7bv1ai31ob,2.0,"I've worked under 3 different store managers and only 1 was worth workin for, from the ungrateful attitudes forceful management and the lying aspect I've seen from that company. There were no incentives for the workers to show appreciation only management could make good money including bonuses most of the time management I worked under were buddy buddy with each other and did as they wanted.. the pay back then was not good at all for what had to be dealt with in most occasion struggled to even get back into work the next day. It took me 8 years to finally make over 10 bucks an hour. It's hard to say what I enjoyed workin for that company I stuck with it long as I could hoping for a better outcome each year, when I was released I just found out I was having a kid and the day I was fired the manager at the time told me it was because of a customer complaint at the time but also cause of a complaint 6 months before that one so I asked to show me the documentation which all complaints were filed on the computer and she told me she couldn't pull it up and didn't know how cause she would of had to look through a bunch of files which was a lie. The hardest part of that job was tryin not to walk out."
PetSmart,1cjus8d9s0mcm3j3,5.0,"I loved the people I worked with. Very good trainers that teach you want needs to be done. The animals are amazing and it's very fun. On weekends, non profit organizations come with dogs and cats and it's just a great atmosphere."
PetSmart,1cju8nbsd1ai34pd,5.0,Loved working at Petsmart I hated leaving everyone was so kind to me I was just going through a bad time and had to take care of a certain situation that is now resolved
PetSmart,1cjtprdr21ahk1f6,4.0,"If you like animals, this is aa good place to work. This is a job and not a career. Typical retail environment. A very good place to gain experience about all animals."
PetSmart,1cjtkseql1ahk14i,1.0,When I say location will affect your happiness I mean it! Certain managers at certain locations will either bring you up or tear you to shreds.
PetSmart,1cjs6ridg1d1434d,2.0,I wouldn’t recommend this job because it is extremely stressful and I don’t feel that they level of pay accurately reflects the work that I do. I have also not seen any opportunity for advancement in my position.
PetSmart,1cjs3efv90mt73k0,1.0,"Don’t waste your time because you WILL end up leaving. The Store Leaders that have these positions aren’t leaders. They will sit in their offices and not help the employees in the floor. If you are a male they will make you do all the heavy lifting and dirty work. They claim to have a open door policy, but it’s used against you. Anyone that is a threat to their position they will find a way to get you out of the door. I spent a lot of time at the company and loved everyone there, but be careful of the clicks cause all it takes is two people to not like you and all they need to do is call Associate Relations aka CareSmart and complain and you WILL be written up no questions asked. The Florida area is a mess with incompetent managers who don’t know how to run a business or treat people with respect. Run Run Run!!! It’s so bad that other lower lever employees were offered the same job and they wouldn’t accept it because they knew they would be used as a pawn."
PetSmart,1cjroq4dh1ah55su,4.0,"When working in pet care, you are obviously going to be expected to do a lot of cleaning.  For about the first three hours of the day,  that is all you do.  Each day of the week, you cleaned a different set of animals cages.  I didn't feel like the rotation in employees who came in early (who had to clean) vs. the ones who came in later was fair, but thats life."
PetSmart,1cjrj7d6j1ba3430,5.0,A typical day would be clock in and make sure the registers are clean and ready for business day to begin. Make sure that all stock and shelves are fronted. Greet customers in a professional and warm manner. The workplace culture is very friendly and exciting especially when customers bring in their pets to the store. The hardest part of the job is not having enough time to spend with all the amazing animals that come in the store. The best part of the job is the people you work with.
PetSmart,1cjrhijn31fdj2le,3.0,Management is ok. Mine don't do much. They have been there for awhile and are too comfortable. It would be great if they cared a little more. I am just too old to work with teenagers
PetSmart,1cjq32edt1d030fv,5.0,"Every day you learn new things about each animal. You surround yourself with great advisors who will teach you their experience with animals. Learn to grow your heart for animals, each animal has a unique personality."
PetSmart,1cjp9a3qi1d0j7vl,4.0,"In my current position, very early hours (not a morning person) with very hard labor. I'm constantly running from the time I clock in to the time I leave. I don't mind hard work, but this can get exhausting.. I get little support from higher management in the tasks that must be completed daily even if I'm not there. Basically, if I'm not there, these mandatory tasks don't get done at all. I enjoy the pets I meet and helping the pet parents with their needs. Contrary to popular belief, there's no ""playing"" with the animals. We take care of them. We provide for them. We do everything in our power to keep them healthy. We, however, are there to do a job."
PetSmart,1cjp4cag81ba35u6,4.0,"Overall, the environment was great, the coworkers were very nice and helpful, and the management is very supportive. Honestly, it depends on the setting of everything and how you handle situations. A normal work day could be great or it could go bad due to mistreatment to/from a customer."
PetSmart,1cjoc93101ah51it,5.0,Pet Smart is the best place I've every worked. The managers are amazing and they are extremely flexible with your schedule. I would recommend working here to anyone

PetSmart,1cjnf45teb81f8pr,3.0,"Pet Smart does not take proper care of their animals.  They are often housed in too small homes, and they are not treated well. This place is a lie, hidden behind a veil.  animals should be treated with respect; their hearts beat fierce and free."
PetSmart,1cjn8oi7sb85ef92,5.0,"Very fun place to work, and everyone is nice, hours are flexible and everyone works well with each other. no real downsides besides it only being a part time job for me"
PetSmart,1cjn4u8i052t6e5n,3.0,Great to be able to work with pets on a daily basis.
PetSmart,1cjmsdn465nd7cj8,2.0,"I worked at a Petsmart in a different state and my managers were the best, everyone got along great, I wasn’t stressed at work and I could separate work and personal life. Since I moved stores its like working for a completely different company. I understand everyone is different and does things their own way but it should all be the same policy and everyone should be treated with respect. Whenever managers change stores they implement their own rules and how the store is run day to day and it takes time for the people who worked there before to get used to them and some people just don’t have the patience or respect for that."
PetSmart,1cjms1ffg52t6bsh,3.0,"Some managers are great but some not so much. My day consisted of standing in front of a register all day. Preferably I would've liked to do stock more so you can actually move around and the time goes by faster. As a company its really good at treating employees decently. It all depends on whos in management that day,"
PetSmart,1cjmqk8ddakh3bc6,4.0,"When I worked in Texas, I loooved my store. I made friends with not only the guests, but with every co-worker. I was allowed a promotion soon after I was hired and was given a set schedule with chances to get more hours. My manager cared for everyone and made everyone great everyday. My new store isn't near as warm and friendly as my old store, but they still are friendly and friendly somedays. Every store is different so it's best to see them in person before judging."
PetSmart,1cjm8qtdo5nd7erg,2.0,"The first location I was at wasn't too bad. I was a bather there and transfered to another place once I had my grooming training. The management there was terrible. The work environment is extremely fast paced, especially for a new groomer. They overbook like crazy and expect you to not work any over-time or you get written up. They want to churn out business in unreasonable amount of time, yet not sacrifice quality. This is causing safety concerns and loads of unnecissary stress on both employees and pets."
PetSmart,1cjk98tp4as17dbh,3.0,"Compensation is great if you work in a busy store that sells a lot of classes simply due to the volume of people that pass through the store. For slower stores, compensation is poor since it's hourly plus commission. In slower stores, even if the trainer is part time, they are expected to be on the floor selling classes if they are not in class; the problem is that in a low volume store many classes have 1 or 2 dogs in them and there are few people shopping at any given time to sell classes to."
PetSmart,1cjjun06kak56c8n,5.0,It is an ok job and I like it there. I have been in retail a long time so I really did not learn anything new. Management in ok.
PetSmart,1cjidntr2as17fgc,4.0,You will be doing your job and other people's job...but I liked my co-workers. It was great until a new business took over and started making cuts to staff so we were shorthanded and making it hard for groo.rrs to commission out.
PetSmart,1cjib7c2lb85eevk,3.0,"Working there wasn't the worst, but it sure wasn't a picnic. My coworkers were rude and management never did anything about it. Corporate expectations were a nightmare too."
PetSmart,1cji2i0gd5n96c9f,3.0,This is a good company to work for if you are passionate about animals and want to make a difference. There are lots of opportunity for advancement and the ability to work on your own development.
PetSmart,1cjfokrr4b81f9f6,2.0,"I work here and I’m trying to get a new job for a reason. It’s a high stress job and you get little reward. Especially if you are in petcare. You are in charge of all animals from reptiles to small animals, birds, and even adoption. Managers expect way to much from you."
PetSmart,1cjfaqrssakd49l7,3.0,"It was my first job working with animals so I was very grateful for the opportunity. I did pretty much everything there, overnights, daycare and bathing. The hotel manager was a little crazy, super nice one moment then psychotic the next. Weird rules such as not being allowed to interact with pets until someone else was in the store around 4 am..which made no sense cause they were nowhere near the petshotel anyway. The grooming salon was your typical salon..insanely catty. Second id walk in the room half the time they would just go silent when I had done nothing wrong. Really liked the manager but most of the ""stylists"" thought they were so much better than they were. After working in real salons I realized they were such a joke. They do take abuse seriously there though, one woman got fired for hitting a dog in the bathing area. I don't regret working there because it presented so many other opportunities for me, but I could never work there long term."
PetSmart,1cjf41mb8b899d8m,4.0,"I found that the company had rules that were set in place that seemed outdated to what I was able to work with.  I enjoyed the ability to communicate with others throughout the day, however, it was very stressful knowing my responsibilities couldn't be fulfilled."
PetSmart,1cjeih4tmaqh3ejc,3.0,When I worked for petsmart there was an immediate disapproval with my new location the overall atmosphere was horrible no professionalism whatsoever some of the employees were pretty much in a mindset of I run this place regardless of my position it didn't sit well with me whatsoever
PetSmart,1cjcc3fppb85e85f,2.0,Petsmart was a hard-working job.  Working from four in the morning until 11 in the morning is not exactly an easy thing and for me it was quite an experience although I personally feel that was me that field this company. The job itself was not easy.  I personally learned a lot from this company as far as organizational skills and how to be able to use my time in a viable manner.  My only issue with this company was the fact that I just did not or could not for that matter be able to keep up with the workload as it was a lot of heavy lifting and I was overweight at the time.  Because of this I thought I was not a good fit for this company this company was nice enough to bring me back even when I decided to leave.
PetSmart,1cjc73n93b85efrj,3.0,Associates are friendly but being understaffed by just one person in a department cripples efficiency and morale by putting more pressure on others. The technology used to track and manage inventory is decades old and does not function well with new software updates. The amount of space given to backstock product in very limited resulting in clutter and damaged product.
PetSmart,1cjc5s3d0ak56ft8,3.0,"It's a fun job. You learn a lot about animals and have a lot of regulars. Flexible hours, pretty stress free. I just had terrible management. Unfortunately they really only care about money and not about the well being of the animals."

PetSmart,1cj4rnflkak92akp,2.0,theres no drama but its impossible to have any weekends off. If you want to be a dog groomer there is room to move up but if youre going to school at all its difficult.
PetSmart,1cj4msa9bak929pp,3.0,Pet smart is a busy store we have people come in all the time with millions of questions
PetSmart,1cj4d0m63brd4e1j,4.0,"Petsmart stands for excellence in animal health care and overnight stays at their luxurious hotel suites. Its takes a very special person who has patience and love for different  breeds of dogs and cats. At Petsmart, you will learn life changing experience you can apply to your everyday life. The training is so rewarding and management will become the hands on team for your success. The easiest part of the job is to cuddle, one on one with a dog or cat. However, this makes leaving them the hardest part on the Job."
PetSmart,1cj4clq9sas12d7v,3.0,"I got to work with animals, most of the time. Everything was so chill, but I wish I would get more hours or better pay roll. There was favorites but I went to work not be liked."
PetSmart,1cj493vkab818aci,4.0,It's great experience to learn how to become a groomer by starting as bather  and working your way up. There's room for advancement and great knowledge about products and services for the pets. You learn to sell the best for the pets and bond with many dogs . It's great learning experience in the corporate world and policies and safety procedures for the pets. You learn to do the best for the customer and there pets.
PetSmart,1cj3n95kkakcvd2d,2.0,"While I was working for PetSmart company stock holders forced the board the take the company from public to private by way of a sale to a private equity firm. While this was not the first sign of issues for the company it did start ushering in wholesale changes. Slashing field team members (District Managers, Auditors) and corporate store liason positions. The company that bought PetSmart had a goal to eventually take PetSmart public again and to do this they started by making widespread labor cuts to quickly attempt to up profitability. But BC Partners overpaid for PetSmart, assuming a lot of debt, and this attempt did not help. Since then they, through PetSmart, have also purchased Chewy.com again overpaying and assuming even more debt. Chewy.com has not made a profit for PetSmart since it's acquisition. I say all of this to drive home one point, the corporate leadership and vision of PetSmart is seemingly non-existent."
PetSmart,1cj24grkq5n919m3,3.0,"Hours sucked, pay sucked, managers sucked, paperwork sucked. Only thing that made it bearable was that my specific store was close to hibachi take out"
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1cj2254frb8188cj,5.0,"PetSmart is a great company to work with. Working directly with customers and their pets is a great experience. Here, my skills have greatly improved overall. As an Associate Lead manager, I was solely responsble for our associates relations and customer service as well. The company will take the time and hear your voice if you want to be heard. PetSmart invests in their associates so that they can be as happy as they can be. Great company!"
PetSmart,1cj1i5iotb857bmv,4.0,"Dogs, super cool grooming manager, can advance from bather to groomer, the busier it is the better, occasional tips, reasonable pay, organized workplace"
PetSmart,1cj1fgfn1akguekp,5.0,Loved everything about it. It was the perfect job for a college student. They worked with my school schedule and were always understanding of holidays.
PetSmart,1cj155fec5j4vf0r,4.0,Always learning different things always stay busy if your not getting fish for customers or showing or selling other animals you can always keep yourself busy by facing shelves. There is always something to do. Walking around asking customers if they are doing okay if they need help or just getting ready for the next day or shift.
PetSmart,1cj00akudakcva58,5.0,On a regular workday the moral of the building was always at its highest which lead to great productivity from the associates. The most enjoyable part of the job was the initiative everyone took to ensure that the culture of the building was being practiced.
PetSmart,1civv5sif52t1f76,4.0,i 10/10 would work at petsmart again. co workers were cool and managers were laid back. it was kinda understaffed there was more customers than we could handle at times
PetSmart,1civqs67eb8578tg,5.0,Friendly everybody work at a team everybody was job was done before we all at home all team workers or nice we all Welcome to our customers in and if any customers needed help we all help them with their questions and what their needs for their pet friendly animals
PetSmart,1civnjl4552t1dgm,2.0,I absolutely love the job opportunity that Petsmart has given me. If it wasn't for the management I would have stayed for a very long time. The management is horrible to be honest although our district leader is wonderful. I hope Petsmart in the future maybe conducts 1 on 1 with its employees to further understand the situations per store.
PetSmart,1ciurdvl25nd2e3h,4.0,"Typical day at work - Teamwork is paramount because it gets very busy. Following the regimented tasks helps keep the confusion down, but there is still a never-ending amount of havoc in retail with limited staff. We all make it through."
PetSmart,1ciurb34abrd4c8e,5.0,"need more hours, more positions for part time employees, more store meetings explaining new policies, more training for managers on how to handle employee relations"
PetSmart,1ciuqclf7brd481s,2.0,"The day to day work is not that bad.  However, training is extremely vague and inconsistent.  A lot of what you have to learn is taught by word of mouth or through employee knowledge.  Every store operates slightly different based on this.  So many procedures gets 'updated' or changed so frequently that you're literally just trying to keep up with all the changes."
PetSmart,1cisorn3lakcvfj9,3.0,"It was a fun place to work, but very hard on stocking, no A/C until the store opens at 9am. It was a workout for sure. But there was little to no help, as I was the only stocker for a large scale PetSmart. (Trucks were anywhere from 11-21 pallets constantly)."
PetSmart,1cisn0rrh5n91ab5,3.0,Fun place to work for petsmart great company good benifits great place to find your next best friend friendly faces great people employees get one hr for lunch great way to relax and eat
PetSmart,1cis9uncfakcvahc,2.0,the only thing that sucks about being a dog bather is that you have to become a groomer after you been there for 3 months and go to dallas tx something i cant do because of my health issues also the management treats its employers poorly and you are only part time and get paid every week so i dont earn enough money to get ahead in life so over all the job is fun just the management is poorly
PetSmart,1cis9a83ias12cbu,3.0,"The best part about this job was seeing all of the different types of dogs that were brought into the store. Some days you would spend about 8 hours standing in the same spot, as a cashier, which was annoying. However, if you were able to stay away from being a cashier, the job is fine."
PetSmart,1cis7mhaiaqguf2q,2.0,"Managers are all full-time. If you are a part time associate, you get treated like a janitor. Benefits come with a full time associate. I learned that Pet Smart lacked management."
PetSmart,1ciqvnm0jb818ekp,3.0,"It wasn't bad for a part time job, it just wasn't enough for me to live.The company and environment is great. I love all the charitable donations they make."
PetSmart,1ciqps02mb894a9f,3.0,"Busy days, learned how to groom and bath the pets.  poor salon management,  lack of job security and some benefits. The work was very hard to do and poor hours."

PetSmart,1cipd473haqgu9kr,3.0,"Definitely a corporate run business. Impractical ideals for position held. Poor management. Too much workplace stress. Too many hours worked, especially around the holidays."
PetSmart,1ciohmd9ob8188kb,4.0,Working with animals can be fun but there are times were you'll likely get hurt. Labor can be heavy and customers can be snappier than the dogs. People skills are more important than animal skills here.
PetSmart,1ciobfocgas1285n,5.0,The best part of my job was helping to care for the animals in my department. I would also help customers pick out the best pet for their home. I learned a lot about animal care. This is also the company where I started my cashier learning.
PetSmart,1cio0nc3qb857b7h,3.0,It’s a good job for kids coming out of high school or a part time job but it won’t support your monthly bills and I don’t really think it’s a career job unless you’re a part of management
PetSmart,1cinrk6kuak92fhi,4.0,"I loved this job! I'm a huge animal lover so this was the perfect job for me as there was always an abundance of dogs, cats, etc. Most of the coworkeres were friendly."
PetSmart,1cinf91stakguctq,5.0,"I love the environment of this place, I feel as if I connect more to the customers relating to animals, I usually will build a strong bond with my customers and I always jump to help when someone seems like they might need help finding something. Even if they do not seem lost I will check on them anyways just to make sure everything is going smoothly for their shopping experience. I have bonded with all of my coworkers in a wonderful way and the management as well.. even if there is someone I don't find to be my favorite person I still try to treat them with the same respect as everyone else."
PetSmart,1cilthvnv52srecb,3.0,"The turnover rate is a bit high and it shows. There's someone new fairly consistently. Having new people so often is very emotionally taxing, as well as taking away time to get things done when they need to be shown how to do everything."
PetSmart,1cil55g7makcq90c,4.0,"Pet-smart is a wonderful first time or even forever job. The pet-smart on 1960 and 45 was the worst with management but got better with customer service.  A regular day in the salon you'll come in and sign on the computer , check to see how many dogs you have scheduled and if they have any notes that you need to worry about, then do a walk through of the salon front to back taking pictures of anything that didn't get clean or wasn't there the day before. Once you have done that you will go to your work station begin to set up while this is happening your morning dog 7 a.m. babies should be walking in the door. Once you have put all your morning dogs in a kennel with the service card and checked over everything you may begin your work day."
PetSmart,1ciklgbrtak8sbml,2.0,"An average day is fast paced and packed. I usually cared for three dogs at a time in a three hour time period and two near the end of my shift. Customers can be extremely nasty and there were multiple accounts of sexual harassment from customers. When the offenders were asked to leave, they would get upset and were then given free items and grooming. Getting bitten and attacked by dogs is fairly normal and you are expected to continue with your work. If you report another employee mishandling an animal, you are written up or transferred to another store."
PetSmart,1cikgkqgobrcvejs,4.0,Petsmart Pethotel is a lot of hardwork that is rewarded by playing with dogs all day. you create bonds wiht the aninamls and they recognize you and get super excited to see you. the management is friendly and always willing to work with their employees like schedule adjustments.
PetSmart,1cikbkutuakcq9q4,3.0,"orderfilling for pets. i learn to work smart and not hard by making it easy for my to pick my order but also following the rules. management was different every 3 months, work place unorganized, hardest part you had to make 100% everyday, enjoyable was lunchtime"
PetSmart,1cik77hk552sran4,3.0,"You will be cross trained and have to know just about everything in the store. So you can go from taking care of animals to ringing up customers to doing totes. It may sound like an easy relaxed job but, actually it's not. It is alot of hard work and always something to do. Not alot of down time."
PetSmart,1cijaosd6akcqdue,1.0,It was a very difficult place to advance.  What one does for another does not always apply to the next.  I loved working with the animals and collaborating with the clientele.
PetSmart,1ciin5je0aqgpcmg,3.0,Its a good place to work due to the fact you have weekends off and alot of vaction days lng as yu keep your number up 100% you have little to nothung to worry about
PetSmart,1ciijcbkcb88vb5h,3.0,A typical day at PetSmart is usually pretty busy and fast paced.
PetSmart,1cigcs02cak4rbrf,4.0,"At its core petsmart function like a typical retail store. There are sales figures that need met, percentages in sales vs. traffic. All that you would expect. The difference is that it is pet oriented so you spend a lot of time being around all types of animals, particularly dogs. If you are a cashier its pretty straightforward, just provide the best customer service and ring people up as well as doing some stocking or cleaning around your area, depending on how the Merchandise Leader runs the stocking."
PetSmart,1cigc4qk7b88vano,2.0,"Working here was fun at first I got o play with dogs in the pets hotel and pick up after them however management was severely biased. favorites were clearly played, managers will sit and do nothing while they expect you to fulfill daily tasks. scheduling was fair and were able to work with every ones schedule. the worst part about working here was the management"
PetSmart,1cig6b4sab88vcmr,5.0,Very enjoyable experience doing volunteer work with South Bay Cat Adoptions. I have gained lots of experience assisting and attending to the cats. Helping animals is what I do best.
PetSmart,1cig31jkqaqgpcrj,2.0,If you are looking for a job to give you 40 hours a week this is not it been working there for five months only seen 40 hours four time twice because I used vacation time the management staff tells you  only have to average a 100 for the week but if you try to only pull a just a 100 will wright you up for steeling time they will also try and take your bonus any way they can im looking for a new job.
PetSmart,1cift3t98akgpdll,4.0,"Working at petsmart, I gained the knowledge needed for multiple kinds of animals. It was especially nice to know when buying said animals for myself. I've gained the best of friends and do not regret working at petsmart. Although many of the good employees left and found something more suited and helpful to them."

PetSmart,1cidigoo2ak4rbrp,4.0,"Great place to work, fun and competitive work place. Management was willing to work with busy schedules. Fun and energetic employees. Working with animals is a plus!"
PetSmart,1cibt5vrlb88vbdo,2.0,"Perhaps it was my location, but the managers feel like they can step on you however they want. The job is fine but the way they constantly push you is stressful. When you try talking to them, they brush it off without helping. If you request time off or call out, management and coworkers get very upset."
PetSmart,1cibf4qvjbrcvfg8,4.0,"Working with my scheduled  pets was awesome. I enjoyed giving bath to them   or haircut depends on the owner request. After becoming Pet Salon Manager , scheduling  bathers and groomers became my one of responsibilities."
PetSmart,1cibc0ikc5j4q8nm,5.0,Great opportunity for most people. Not great for someone with a family. Long hours and very stressful during the holidays. Very easy to work your way up.
PetSmart,1ciao39r8akgpa21,5.0,I really enjoyed working there. It was fun seeing such cute dogs and building great relationships with my co workers. It had such a great environment too.
PetSmart,1ciacf15jakcqbbf,1.0,"Over the course of a year I have tried to call in three times and still had to come in because ""there was no one to cover my shift"". I started off in Pet Care, and cross trained in the salon as a bather, we've had at least two bathers up and quit right before their shift and they took me away from my shift in Pet Care and had me take over the dogs in the salon. The work environment is stressful especially in the salon. Managers expect too much from their employees, and give little support. The managers care more about their customers than their employees - they'll back up the screaming customers and throw the employees under the bus. In the salon it is very difficult to ask for any days off, you have to do it 8 weeks in advance and even then it's still iffy that you can get those days off. Salon manager doesn't help the bather by taking walk-in appointments when the bather is fully booked and manager has nothing to do. The salon manager is paid hourly, same as the bathers, and groomers are paid by the dog, so they can't do walk-ins. The manager would rather sit on her phone than take walk-in appointments, while the bather is working on dogs and has to put those dogs away just to help those customers. Groomers in the salon pick favorites and will treat new bathers like idiots until they start to get the hang of things and even then they will treat them the same. It's like high school."
PetSmart,1ci93mbghak8sf6g,1.0,"Management unfortunately killed my experience here. They push policies that are not safe for pets, and push numbers over quality of each customer. Extremely stressful environment"
PetSmart,1ci9228bvak8s9e7,1.0,PetSmart is only a nice place to work if you love animals. Seeing them come into the store was always exciting and provided the day with a little happiness. Other than that the location I worked at was awful. Very unorganized and very lazy management. There were little to no benefits and the pay was very low. Most PetSmarts are smaller stores meaning that one employee could do a little bit of everything and most times you did.
PetSmart,1ci8pimer5n8r80a,4.0,"It was relaxing to work at PetSmart, as the Night Care Pet Specialist, but at times, it was stressful. There was a lot to do in such a tight amount of time that it was difficult to remember what had to be done. In addition to this, it was difficult to balance my education along with working there."
PetSmart,1ci8c8eie5n8rda4,4.0,This was a very enjoyable job.  You not only got to know the pets but their parents too and develop a relationship with them.  There were also many charity events at the store that were fun to participate in.
PetSmart,1ci871046akgp90h,4.0,"I personally loved working at PetSmart. The one in Augusta, ME appeared to genuinely want to help the local humane society and pet parents make the best choices for their pets as opposed to the bottom line. Very clean and great teamwork. The problem is that most of the positions were part-time and that doesn't pay the bills for most people. I worked between 14-32 hours in any given week."
PetSmart,1ci7snnfsb88vdj8,3.0,Groomers are paid on commission and PetSmart keeps hiring more so there is not enough dogs to make a livable income. There are days where you do nothing but sit and there are days where you get so overworked you want to cry. The pay is very inconsistent and poor. You are forced to bend over backwards for every customer no matter what because they hurting for customers so bad. It’s a very stressful situation to work in. You get yelled at by customers and management on a weekly basis. Not fun at all.
PetSmart,1ci5ua314as0pdpq,1.0,"Horrible place to work.  If you don't quit, you will be fired.  The turnover rate is unbelievable, and is the direct result of poor management.  If they were fair or cared about their employees, it would be ok.  Favoritism and 3rd grade playground rules apply."
PetSmart,1ci5s77l7b84vdgm,3.0,I liked working at the groomery. It was a new concept and I was happy to be chosen to start as a bather. They worked with my schedule being part time and understood my needs.
PetSmart,1ci5n60kbak4of4h,1.0,Management is very poor and disorganized. Manager wasn’t around to help in our salon as much as she should have. I wish this job experience was less stressful.
PetSmart,1ci5budjc5n8ofi0,4.0,I love the training part of the job because it allows me to create a bond with pet parents and their pets while they learn to communicate with them using positive reinforcement techniques.
PetSmart,1ci4i3jh3as0pbgf,4.0,"A typical day at work was very stressful. There are 12 groomers and 3 bathers packed into a tiny salon with no windows and 6 grooming tables. I loved the pay and my managers, but there was only so far you could advance as a groomer."
PetSmart,1ci4b5fvr5ncpbhi,5.0,Everyone was nice and helpful. I would have never left this job but lost our home and could not get to work with as little hours I had. The gas prices prevented me from be able to get back and forth and still have money to live on.
PetSmart,1ci41jui5ak8pck4,3.0,"Again, I loved what I did. Informing pet parents on the proper products was satisfying. But once the quality of pet care declined, and the favoritism showed admits the work environment, the amount of hours and pay wasn't enough to simply living standards."
PetSmart,1ci3t2lrnb84v9nt,5.0,The most enjoyable part of working in PetSmart was watching all the pets come in and seeing the faces of the parents after having all their questions and help they needed. I've learned a lot being with PetSmart from cashiering to stocking to doing manager jobs.

PetSmart,1ci2ne2hgbrcs99v,3.0,good for someone who only needs a few hours a week and is really flexible with hours. for how hard you work you don't really get paid very much. they don't give you the same amount of hours every week so planning my bills was very difficult and caused me to be late a lot on them
PetSmart,1ci2h276jakcn8on,4.0,"Over all petsmart is not a bad place to work for a groomer, paid time off steady work and benefits. Very fast pace and can be stressful at times but if your a groomer with plans of managment it's a good place"
PetSmart,1ci2fa1soakcnaeq,4.0,The petsmart company as a whole puts alot on their employees.  Managers and Staff alike.  High up beyond the Store Manager does not listen to their employees very well.

PetSmart,1ci0vah6cakck8h5,3.0,Most of the managers were good the work environment was good maybe some work on more education for care takeing of animals staff should have more knowledge by corporate
PetSmart,1ci0trdbtak4lb00,5.0,"must love animals, fast pace and lots of managment change. unsure of why I must write such a long review for a job aplication. but if you love animals and need a starter job this job is perfectly fine."
PetSmart,1ci0otvmlakckb66,4.0,PetSmart loves pets and believes pets make us better people. PetSmart will be the trusted partner to pet parents and pets in every moment of their lives.
PetSmart,1ci0muijhakgjaao,3.0,A lot of turnover in management within the stores.  And tons of change on a weekly basis from reporting to methods to do things.  Job is very inventory based for counting products daily for about 4-5 hours and that's 4-5 days a week of counting products..
PetSmart,1ci0cd4ka5ncmdi6,3.0,"Good place to work for college students. very willing to accomadate your schedule, but the pay is minimum wage and doesn't ever really improve.  But you get to spend the day with puppies so that's nice."
PetSmart,1ci0afrjkaqgjd7b,5.0,This is an extremely fast paced work environment. Almost everyone is willing to assist you when needed. Management team keeps you updated and is willing to give guidance.
PetSmart,1chvo27tcakck9af,4.0,great place to work especially if your an animal lover. be ready to work weekends and holidays. the leadership in my district is great and I love the relationship I have with them
PetSmart,1chtvlcn5as0mbfp,4.0,"Petsmart will constantly try to push you into doing almost everything, from cashering to sales associate, to cleaning, etc. They have also taught me a great amount in animal care."
PetSmart,1chtttcdj52slbbl,1.0,"This place is horrible to work for. Managment knows absolutely nothing about warehousing besides walking around and picking up trash and wood chips. Always being watched. Latest manager was hired from a coffee shop. No advancement opportunities unless you know a boss or you kiss their butt. Only promote women, I saw 4 or 5 promoted within a year. Rates are insane to hit. Boxes in warehouse are not put in any order so people have trouble building skids. During busy season they make you pick kitty litter tubs for 5 hours out of your 10 hour shift. While their favorites pick dog toys for 10 hours and can easily make bonus. A lot of petty drama within co workers he said she said. Wouldn't recommend anyone work here it's very brutal. Trainers know nothing they don't help you build pallets all they do is ride around on a bike and talk to people."
PetSmart,1chtntl7ub84qc5i,4.0,I had a lot of fun working here. I left because I wanted to broaden my resume. It was fun educating customers about animals and also to be around animals. I've learned a lot from this job.
PetSmart,1chthq9a7akck9j8,1.0,"Very bad job. Overnight you are by yourself which is not a good idea to begin with. If you need help you are pretty much on your own. I had gotten sick overnight and had called manager that was supposed to be on call to help but no response. So I left the store and then I was yelled at for leaving store. My manager Dave was not concerned for my health of being sick and didn't care that I was unable to reach anyone, although one other person was there with me she was swamped with work because the dish washer broke and water was all over floor so i did not want to bother her. Dave yelled at me because I left and apparently i set off alarm making police come. Dave cared more about the store than an employee."
PetSmart,1chtekbff5ncm8oh,5.0,"The job is easy enough, the pay is good considering most of the day is spent stocking or fixing the inventory. There are lot of animals to play with, which kind of relieves the stress of deadlines or customers. The job does get quite monotonous as a downside."
PetSmart,1chst4vitak4lbi2,2.0,Stress filled day in and day out.  Loved the pets and merchandise but the atmosphere at our store was very stressful.  Nobody took their job seriously and they were always getting into disagreements.
PetSmart,1chribubvakgjfmv,1.0,This job is very stressful and lacks teamwork.  Always gaps in the schedule and short staffed. More about the money than about the animals. Would not recommend.
PetSmart,1chq4ut1fb80rdlr,4.0,Very fun working with the pets. Management was ok. I received consistent hours. Coworkers were fun though they had already been working with each other for awhile so you could feel a little left out sometimes.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1chp341l3as0m9g4,4.0,It is very hard to put in vacation as a leader. But if you work for the company for 5 years you get an extra week
PetSmart,1chotl7rp5n8lcp3,1.0,"Corporate sucks, management gets killed from corporate, i worked in grooming, corporate didn't care about the pets just the money, and the stylists got in trouble when the dog got put first over the dollar signs"
PetSmart,1choqr2e852slb89,3.0,nothing worse than a high turn over rate. good company but should focus on employees better. and keep a better eye on their store leaders. but to do that you would have to have a consistant district leader. someone just needs to crack the whip and hold people accountable for their actions
PetSmart,1chn5m4rlak8mbs5,5.0,I was proud to educate people on proper animal husbandry and care. Hardest part was learning and seeing how many people neglect their pets or are unaware of the amount of work and care that goes into owning one.
PetSmart,1chmihlgjak8me5a,4.0,Fastpaced workplace.  Lots of changes on a consistent basis to ensure PetSmart continues to be the top company in its field.
PetSmart,1chm3joehb84q9bb,5.0,If you love animals and love interacting with other people who love animals this is the perfect job. It is a very fun place to work at and give people and their pets a wonderful experience.
PetSmart,1chm0p2ldak8ma26,3.0,Petsmart is definitely not a place for people who've never worked in service before. You need to know how to communicate with each other and the clients.
PetSmart,1chlrnvk5ak8m9im,2.0,management sucks they don't care about associates. they want robots not people. most supervisors know nothing about the department their over. they are always late posting numbers. overall I would not recommend.
PetSmart,1chlggvsqak4leno,4.0,"A great place to work if you love animals, i learned more about pets, and how to watch for emergency pet behavior, you also clean and make sure all pets are taken care of with food, water and clean rooms at all time."
PetSmart,1chkbat5takck96d,3.0,Fun place to work and always a friendly pet to brighten your day. A lot of work to be done keeping up with cleaning each area as well as attending to customers.
PetSmart,1chjglbe2b88ma9p,5.0,They we're flexible and understanding and supportive. They we're open to associates ideas. They took care of their associates needs. They wanted a better work place.
PetSmart,1chjf72dpas0k9bd,3.0,"At the time that I left the company, the focus shifted away from genuine care as client assistance to pushing certain products or services even if it was not apropriate."
PetSmart,1chhltb0kak4icea,2.0,"Actually sucked the entire time, management does whatever they want and dont pay any attention to the animals health, only really cares about sales. pet care team ends up solely responsible for animal health and has to convince managers to actually take care of the animals by getting them vet appointments."
PetSmart,1chh1njr1b88lc0s,5.0,"If you have and love pets, this is a good place to work.  Customers are generally happy when they come into the store, especially when they get to show off their pet(s)."
PetSmart,1chgrjoj9ak4idc4,4.0,"offers decent pay in a fun but hard working work environment, lots of work advancement opportunities, management communicates well and clearly so you know exactly what you need to be doing and given the tools to do it"
PetSmart,1chgoc198akchetk,4.0,"I really liked working here- at first. Coworkers are awesome, the customers were okay, and the first manager that hired me was very nice and team oriented. But when the managers changed everything started to change and it became a lot more disorganized. It was difficult when things would be marked as little as a dollar with no notification to the cashiers and no identifying marks to separate them from normal priced items in stock. And when trying to confirm price changed being met with rude and condescending remarks or attitudes. It was also very frustrating that the regional supervisor (as we were told) limited the number of total hours worked for one store so we were always understaffed with only two people in the store during some of our busiest hours."
PetSmart,1chgcngfaakchb39,1.0,The lacking of staffing and nonexistent dog qualifications as a good fit often led to employee and dog injuries. They would put inexperienced staff with known aggressive dogs and the staff member would end up getting bit. They would also overbook appointments which led to the staff member having to rush and often the dog would end up injured.
PetSmart,1chf019sfaqgganl,2.0,"Was let go for obtaining pink eye and brought in a doctors note stating I could not work the hours I was set due to an emergency, I felt the manager was being a little insensitive and not understanding."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1ches1pj6b84navo,4.0,Good place to learn your entry management skills. Can take some time to move up to the higher management positions. Can be fun place to work. Fast paced.
PetSmart,1ched5227b80oetf,4.0,A pro employee company with excellent benefits.
PetSmart,1che5ot3mb88las3,4.0,"I learned a lot about animals during my time at Petsmart, the work environment was nice, lots of friendly people, tasks were easy to preform, it was a steady pace job"
PetSmart,1che2pef0akchedf,5.0,I absolutely adore my job at PetSmart. I love working with and around animals. Most days were fast paced but even the really slow days were pretty enjoyable.
PetSmart,1che14gt6b84n92q,3.0,"Depending on the day, work can be slow or busy, scheduling is usually ran in 4 hour blocks. Lunches consisted of 30 minutes, and we were given 2 15 minute breaks if we worked 8 hours."
PetSmart,1che06lkuakggd0r,1.0,"PetSmart the company is under quite a bit of fire lately due to bad groomers being careless with the dogs under their care, and the good groomers are not paid a sufficient wage, good enough healthcare or ideal hours to want to stay."
PetSmart,1che033coak8je1g,1.0,"Was discriminated against due to my age, and was not considered for any position to advance a career there.  They did not give the hours needed to support my family and myself. They are not a team work type environment. Everyone is for themselves. Unhealthy work place."
PetSmart,1chdu94bbak4iepa,4.0,"Easy work just as any other retail job, but it's better than others because you get to be with animals every day. I've seen a goat, a pig, & a bunny brought into the store, all by nice loving pet parents. The staff really cares i love the job because all the animals help you forget that your working."
PetSmart,1chdqrba1as0jaoq,4.0,Great temp job . Good hearted people. People work here because they have a strong connection with animals and want to do everything in their power to do what’s best for them.
PetSmart,1chdp0gikak8jbvu,5.0,"I started at Petsmart when I was 18. It's amazing and fun. You learn so much and your coworkers all love animals as much as you, so it's always a blast. They don't really pay anyone enough to ""live"" off the salary, but when your fresh out of highschool or in college it will definitely cover what you need it to. I stayed on Part Time for 7 years because it was just such a fun working environment."
PetSmart,1chd0bm1ib84nega,4.0,"I get to meet people's dogs every day while doing simple enough entry-level retail work with some pet care mixed in. And I genuinely like most of our managers, the only annoyance is a variable schedule and occasional lack of hours."
PetSmart,1chd012okbrclbie,4.0,Working at petsmart was fun and I was able to learn a lot about working with animals while I was there. Getting a regular schedule is really difficult and you may not always get all of your breaks during your shift if it is really busy.
PetSmart,1chchdg231agv3e4,1.0,Management only cares about making a profit and does not care about the health of the animals in the store. They are very callous when it comes to getting required tasks completed.
PetSmart,1chcad0gg1ahu38p,5.0,The job was amazing. I had the pleasure to interact with many creatures that I dont encounter on a daily basic. I made many great relationships with my co workers and customers.
PetSmart,1chc3knff0mcu3fd,3.0,"its an ok job i would never work there again but it good it you are just starting out, the customer are good to be around and you must love pets witch i do"
PetSmart,1chc062ud1ahu4gl,5.0,Would usually start shift off with quick meeting about focus for day and then jump in to customer service and store duties. We had a great vibe at the store I worked at with good employee relations and made shifts fun and enjoyable. Loved seeing the pups!
PetSmart,1chbj8dcf1d1f139,3.0,They did give accurate information to me about how commission works and they underpay their staff. Manager is unorganized and hardly ever gets the schedule out on time.
PetSmart,1chaibs4s1bae7tn,3.0,If you love pets  and you need a part time job an associate is a good job to have at this company if you are looking into management be prepared to lose your personal life. The requirements and job duties for management positions are ridiculous and overly strenuous.
PetSmart,1ch8kq4981aie4d0,4.0,"I love being a pet trainer, at this time sales are low and my commission pay is not what i want or need it to be."
PetSmart,1ch7ff61h1aie149,4.0,Petsmart is a great place to gain experience in cashiering and about customer service. You do as well learn about caring for animals. You do get trained on how to speak to customers and getting certain sales as certain things through the year do get promoted a lot.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1ch7cvt1rb84hbkv,5.0,"I loved my job there. I was having a hard time with my son whom had medical illness and how to understand how to help him, raising 2 teenage boys and work a full time job. I lost my only son to mental illness and lost my job. I still have nothing bad to say about Petsmart. I love that company, I am stronger now and have been and I had to move on and get a job at Veyo. I want to move on and do more for members/patients/ people and help them. I want to be with a company that will help me with that. I have a lot more knowledge and strengh. I know I would be a great part of you team with a lot of knowledge. I have over 15 years experience working with customer services. I love helping out others. I am very compassionate and caring, integrity, thorough and love to learn new and different things every day."
PetSmart,1ch75t3gsb84hfui,4.0,"I love working at PetSmart in the grooming salon. I just can't make a living for what it pays me. If I could be a full time bather, I would stay. I don't want to be a dog stylist and that's what the bathing position is all about: stepping up to haircuts."
PetSmart,1ch72jht91bae6o4,4.0,It okay to work there if your in school don't give a lot of hours for people that are not in school other then that it is a good work place with great management
PetSmart,1ch6snesf1agv1vc,4.0,You stay busy while working here. Customers are mostly friendly. The animals are so adorable. I learned a lot working here. Associates work together as a team.
PetSmart,1ch6o6a2fb80id6p,4.0,"It was a good job,only part time and there is overtime during the holidays.  Very strict on adherence and policies.  Not so strict on having your phone with you."
PetSmart,1ch61sn0p1aie094,3.0,"Good for high school students as well as a temporary job for someone who is in between jobs. Easy work environment, must have good customer service skills."
PetSmart,1ch4shpsdb84h8j4,3.0,I liked Working there for the first year. The management was terrible. It was nice starting as a cashier then getting promoted to a dog bather and from there get sent to grooming academy and becoming a dog groomer.
PetSmart,1ch45ufg6b80iarv,1.0,The managers don't train you properly they just want you to get every thing done yesterday. Co-workers were great. Great staff discount. Enjoyed working with the animals.
PetSmart,1ch3qe3b31aie4lm,4.0,"fun times and great managers.always smiles on everyones face..........always had breaks and great work life balance. alwasy meeting new people, new dogs."
PetSmart,1ch3mlbkq0mcu7fn,4.0,"This was my second job and I absolutely love it. Working with the animals is definitely my favorite part but it can be stressful at times when the store is extremely busy and many people need help.  If you wanna work here remember that this is a retail store above everything else. Customer service is extremely important to this company. I started as a cashier and working my way over to pet care. Being a cashier is incredibly easy but their registers are old and I think the system really needs to be updated, especially with the amount of fraud that it doesn't detect. In my store, the animals were always treated fairly, no matter what PETA or whatever group says. My coworkers and I are all passionate about the well being of the pets we sell, and it definitely shows in our customer service. Thankfully we're allowed to deny certain animals to people who we feel wouldn't take care of them. As far as the retail part goes, they definitely push you to sell puppy guides, training classes, and get people's emails at the register. It can be annoying depending on who your managers are and how much they wanna push you to sell. I think the thing I hate most about the company is how they don't really hire managers from within your store. I feel it's incredibly hard to work your way up in this company. The pay also sucks. I started 2 years ago at 9/hr and I'm at 9.44 right now. The only benefits I get is paid time off that slowly adds up by the minute. The employee discount is 15%."
PetSmart,1ch3iho931ahf63e,5.0,It was always pretty calm and very fun to always see dogs and cats. The hardest part of the job is by far when a family is about to put down their dog. its rough particularly if its a regular.
PetSmart,1ch1uv7sp1bgf3h2,4.0,I've worked in the grooming salon for years now and it is a friendly and demanding environment. Groomer's pay is based off commission so you get out what you put into it. Great place for the motivated employee!
PetSmart,1ch1oudkh0kbv39m,3.0,Working in the salon is very high paced and stressful. Corporate expects you to do so much than just grooming dogs. I really enjoyed working in ma and pa shops but they don't have any benifits.
PetSmart,1ch18l8fab80iak1,3.0,The job and its benefits were great. Although the environment made working there stressful and a huge impact on my mental state that caused me to not be greatful for working there like i had used to.
PetSmart,1ch0u6ncc0kbv0ep,4.0,Working at PetSmart was fun and i enjoyed it just because i am a pet owner. It helped me learn certain things about animals that i would need in the future as a pet owner.
PetSmart,1ch0jl8uu0kbv08s,4.0,"In all my years it's hard to give an overall review. It honestly depends on the store leader. I've seen a lot come and go. Basically, if the store manager sucks the job will suck. If the store manager is dedicated, and cares it's a wonderful place to work. The only overall negative thing is the lack of job security with the retail apocalypse. Watching other retailers next to you shut down, and seeing sales drop, wondering how long it will be before it spreads. to your store."
PetSmart,1cgvlmci21agv5gk,3.0,PetSmart was fun but corporate made it difficult to work with living animals.  I worked there for 4 years and never had any major issues until I became a manager.
PetSmart,1cgv6bdaf1fdv5p1,3.0,Bad management made a great job stressful. Petsmart is a corporation and It would have been a better place if more care went towards the pets than the bottom dollar.
PetSmart,1cgunqror1fdv48d,5.0,"I loved the team work and positive attitude. Everyone was professional, everyone cared about the customers and would do everything they could to help."
PetSmart,1cguk3crd0kbv0u2,4.0,very fun place to work for if you are interested in animals. great energy within the team and the staff and also great communication between the managers and the staff.

PetSmart,1cgu9mdml1ahf7dv,4.0,"At times we were busy, other times not. Got to meet a lot of people and their animals. Had to straighten store before and after closing. Management was pretty good."
PetSmart,1cgt30ced1d0a18k,4.0,"I enjoyed working at PetSmart a lot I learned a lot about the animals that I did not know before and how to take care of all different species. Nice experience, poor management."
PetSmart,1cgt0i2cu1d1c21h,4.0,My first two stores were fantastic! My last store was great until we got a new manager who played favorites. She was let go shortly after I left due to this. I feel that the company as a whole has great values and does right by the employees.
PetSmart,1cgsqtbs21fdr1r2,1.0,"Very stressful place to work. Management is horrible. They tell you one thing, but do the complete opposite. They don't care about the animals either."
PetSmart,1cgsm2shf1ba548e,4.0,"Just being in the store helping customers with their pets, which included all types of animals, was amazing and fun! I had many interesting conversations and each day that went by I improved my customer service skills."
PetSmart,1cgse3p5u0mtq76g,3.0,Extremely disorganized with no management and this is the reason I am quitting. They do not treat their employees right. They paid me decent but all of my peer were not.
PetSmart,1cgs46qn31ah9294,4.0,"Very fun environment and fast paced, I wouldn't have left if I didn't move, I miss it all the time, my manager was great and always made sure everyone was taken care of."
PetSmart,1cgs3tf401ago4sg,1.0,terrible management
PetSmart,1cgs2hbo51ago75q,4.0,"the day to day experience of the job is pretty much all physical. It can be very tiring. Petsmart offers excellent benefits such as medical, dental, eye. however, the job safety is very low. management doesnt hesitate to tell you, you can be replaced if you arent hitting the productivity goal."
PetSmart,1cgrvo98b1ago69e,1.0,Petsmart isn't a good company to work for.  There isn't any deference in pay from the stocker to the cashier.  The working environment is chaotic and hostile.  There aren't any full time positions except for management.  No room for advancement as well.  Very poor pay.
PetSmart,1cgnv0ria1d0t080,3.0,"The job is very easy, but tends to get busy and you get pressured and yelled at for not getting tasks done although you're told customers first. Customers are extremely rude and impatient. Managers have favorites. They let employees get away with not doing their job with no repercussions."
PetSmart,1cgne4enn1ai843p,4.0,"At my time at Petsmart, I’ve had the opportunity to put myself into the animal husbandry world. It’s a fantastic place to start if you’re serious about pet care. Management can be unreasonable due to corporate standards, but if you do your own thing, you’re going to have a good time"
PetSmart,1cgljfdlh1ah950f,5.0,"Obscenidades, lenguaje discriminatorio o cualquier otro lenguaje no apropiado para un foro público"
PetSmart,1cghn8snj0kbr4se,4.0,The staff was fantastic in helping me learn and grow in the position I was in. There was always room to make friends there and it was great to help all the customers who came in.
PetSmart,1cghkmrnc1aho6g1,3.0,"I wouldn't make it a career, but PetSmart was an excellent place to make some money. They are willing to work around your schedule, usually, and the job is not difficult."
PetSmart,1cgh533a40mtq35o,5.0,I love animals and loved working at Petsmart.  They took care of their employees and the animals.  Loved helping customers with their pet needs and acquiring a new family member
PetSmart,1cggfa5at1ba12o3,3.0,"Company is always changing policies which in some ways is beneficial and necessary, however, a lot to keep up with. The job is much more physically demanding than let on. I think each location so the job might be different with someone else. I think a big part of how the job will suite you is also who is managing."
PetSmart,1cgg8ci080mtl613,3.0,"A typical day working at Petsmart was to come in at 3:00AM, immediately begin receiving merchandise truck and begin restocking shelves until about 8:00AM. At this time if most of the receiving and stocking was complete my manager would place me at a cash register to work in the capacity of a cashier. Management was very hands off but stressed and pushed safety standards and a safe working environment while stocking, and friendly customer service at the cash register. Lifting and moving heavy weight around consistently for several hours without a break was the hardest and most enjoyable part of my job as i love to be challenged in any capacity."
PetSmart,1cgg3l8a40mt54hp,3.0,"I'm sure other locations had to have been better than mine. However, at my location the salon manager was not given the authority to correct the issues in the salon (ie. issues among employees, broken equipment, etc). The general manager micromanaged the salon and salon manager while showing blatant favoritism to a clique that had dug into that store. Meanwhile new employees were treated like garbage, and the general manger made jokes about it. The culture was all about the bottom line with no care to the pet's or the guest's needs."
PetSmart,1cgfs4d3a1fdm0hg,1.0,The management was awful! If you had an issue they would just pass it around from manager to manager and you would never get a solution to anything. The work is fast pace which is great but when you need help it is never there.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.

PetSmart,1cgflnk9q1fdm3t8,5.0,"loved being around the pets. easy to get along with co-workers, wish I had more hours. got to interact with different type of animals. close by the home."
PetSmart,1cgfeea2l1d130n7,3.0,Only worked here for a small period of time. Cleaning fish tanks and stocked items on the shelves. Was a good job to have when I was also working in the same building at the veterinary hospital.
PetSmart,1cgfe4kn70mcj5se,1.0,"dont do it, do not recommend, run while you can. loved the coworkers, management was lacking. management was also very unprofessional. they allowed personal feelings influence the decisions on who got promotional or additional job training to advance."
PetSmart,1cgf9vlq11bg21at,5.0,I loved working for PetSmart in the PetsHotel. It was like one big family. Your hard work was always noticed and rewarded in some way. The people are super friendly. I definitely felt it was an awarding job with opportunities to move up with the company.
PetSmart,1cgf4hhr51ba17j1,3.0,"lots of drama at the store, but generally had a good time working and felt supported by my manager. they did a good job of training me and had fun working with the dogs and building relationships with the customers and their pets."
PetSmart,1cgdtf1ho1d0i4qe,1.0,"I worked in the grooming salon. To be completely honest, a lot of against policy stuff happens back in the salon. Too many dogs and not enough time to dry them all. Dogs are left with the cage dryers on them for an hour or more at a time depending on the schedule. Dogs are tied and left to sit in the baths unattended, you're not allowed to turn down a nail trim so if you have four nail trims that dog could be sitting back in the bath tied up and wet for anywhere between 20-40 minutes depending on how fast you are with nail trims. The salon manager lets you have customers that you charge the minimum for, so that you can get the tip money under the table."
PetSmart,1cgdpefc50mtl327,5.0,I work all positions so it gets a bit crazy sometimes abut the job is nice. Hours are less then wanted at times. Pay is not the worst. Always have something to do.
PetSmart,1cgdic8rj1bg26hp,3.0,not enough support from management. corporate has unrealistic ideals for management and associates to handle for the rate of pay they get. they continue to add on more and more tasks with no additional hours or help allowed. there is a general 'money hungry' feel to the corporation now. a lot of their services can't match with new and up and coming companies because they refuse to spend money on updating things or fixing things that are not considered safety issue.
PetSmart,1cgd3r4hc1d0i6i1,5.0,Great place to work! I had to relocate but this was my favorite employer. There is room for improvement much like any other place BUT this company treats their employees well and it feels good to be appreciated there!
PetSmart,1cgd01ak51fdm346,5.0,Working at Petsmart for me is great. We are like family. Sometimes when the store is busy you can feel like it is understaffed but you do your best to get the job done. I feel the management is open and there for you.
PetSmart,1cgcu0fop1d0i4r3,5.0,"It a very fun and fast pace job that will keep you on your toes so be ready for some new everyday, however it can be stressful on days so ppl will need to know how to cope and multi-task as well."
PetSmart,1cgctmkp91bg20t7,4.0,"Sometimes it's too much drama here, some people just start mess just to have fun, managers can be either rude to you about why you're late or why you can't work, sometimes customers can be rude as well, but some days it's the opposite like people can take care of the situation."
PetSmart,1cgcmglj31d136pt,5.0,It is a good place to work if you don't have kids. I have 5 kids and they require alot of attention. working nights is not good for someone who has kids and wants to spend time with them.
PetSmart,1cgbbut3o1d135iv,4.0,"A lot of customer service. Great interaction with co-workers. management is well maintained and helpful. I'm always learning something new at my store. Sometimes it can get overwhelming during the weekends as we get extremely busy but we always tackle every situation with our team player roles. I love helping our customers and making sure they have found everything they were looking for and well taken care of. It's a great place to work, I love it there."
PetSmart,1cgb4nlbcakgi8a6,5.0,If your looking for a place that treats its employees fairly and has good oppurtunities for advancement if your willing to work for it this is a great place for that. Management when I was employeed were the best I have ever experianced they check on new employees regularly and training lasts 2 weeks where they have you assigned with an experianced member to ask questions and relay knowledge. Staff is polite and friendly to everyone and extremely helpful.
PetSmart,1cgb4hvl0akgif5i,3.0,"just another underpaid job. it was fun working with the animals. the environment you get depends on the manager working, as with most jobs. uniform is too uptight for the environment"
PetSmart,1cgaqla1cbrcjd1n,5.0,"The managers really care about their employees. As long as you show up when scheduled and help out, they will help back in any way they can. Everything is dealt with in a professional manner and the company overall is a great company to work for. Always room for advancement and if you start in one area and think you might like another, it is easy to be trained elsewhere."
PetSmart,1cgaqci46b84lfsu,5.0,I love New Animal day its dope. The people are dope and honestly I can't think of very many bad things to say about this job. The animals make the job worth it just by itself and even makes it easy to work with everyone even if they are a bit abrasive.
PetSmart,1cgao24ql52sk89o,5.0,"I loved my job at PetSmart, I honestly was just ready for a change. While there they gave me so many opportunities and opened so many doors for me. It was a great start but I'm ready to try new things."
PetSmart,1cganlvisakci8c1,3.0,"As a dog trainer I was fortunate to always be able to break away and make personal connections with my students and their dogs. Hardest part was being so short staffed all the time, and management not working well together."

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1cgan8cpoak4k8ii,3.0,"A ""typical day"" at PetSmart does not exist. Obviously weekends and holidays are busiest because most people are off from work. Other than groomers, management are the only full time employees, which sometimes can make things difficult. The most difficult part of my job is the never ending additional responsibilities, policies and procedures, and communicating all of these changes to staff."
PetSmart,1cgak7pfdaqgiapl,3.0,Expected way to much out of just one employee to run the whole side of the store. They put way to much work load on the Pet Care associates and expected everything to be 100% perfect.
PetSmart,1cgaeln355nckbu1,3.0,the management is horrible they dont care if you have a family you get wrote up if you call out twice a year they see you as a number they dont care about You they only care about the company they dont care about customers only the money
PetSmart,1cg8ro9edbrcjcm7,3.0,"are constantly caring for animals coming in, must be a fast worker and should be good at multitasking."
PetSmart,1cg7sjs68as0kco0,4.0,PetSmart provides a different atmosphere compared to most retail chains due to the variety of animals and entertaining customer/pet interactions. Communication is somewhat lacking in some areas but can be improved upon nonetheless. All staff members are nice and willing to work to further improve store culture and sales.
PetSmart,1cg7n0g025nckcli,2.0,Animals were not kept in the best conditions and we as employees could not do anything to help them. Management was terrible and some managers did not know anything about animals that were not dogs or cats.
PetSmart,1cg7lgi6i5nck8qe,5.0,As a cashier it is pretty laid back. It does get busy form time to time  but still pretty simple and you have other workers there to back you up if need be. They gave me pretty good pay for a part time seasonal cashier.
PetSmart,1cg5vcld5as0kc5b,2.0,"Strefful place to work, always under-staffed, horrible management. Unorganized, high prices, careless associates, unfair scheduling. Bad pay, rough environment. Low discount rate."
PetSmart,1cg5lseuiaqgi97i,4.0,The job its self you would really have to have patience and understanding. dogs cannot talk so you have to be able to be patient. I loved interacting with the dogs and getting to know them and pet parents
PetSmart,1cg58porhas0k82u,4.0,"Although weekends got pretty busy, I wouldn't say an average day was super busy. And by busy I mean customer busy. On the slow days I would clean any fish tanks that need it, that was most of how I spent my shifts. There always seemed to be another tank that was dirty. Throughout even my worst shifts I think all the the whole team was always trying to help eachother. I think we communicated very well on where we needed to be and where someone was needed for customer service and ect. As petcare specialist I take any returns. Petsmart has a 14 day health guarantee. So no matter what reason we took in returned pets. This was the worst part of the job. I hated seeing the animals I helped care for and maybe got a bit attatched to come back dead. I wish there was not such a big return policy because half the time I did not want to give the said customers another pet. My favorite part of working here other than greeting all the dogs and their owners, is closing or opening. This is when I would handle the animals the most. Checking on them and trying to reasure them that being handled was not the worst thing in the world."
PetSmart,1cg4oqne8b80ler2,3.0,Used to be a wonderful and family oriented company. After selling Petsmart to investors 2 years ago they lost their core values and beliefs in how they treat associates and the atmosphere they create. They are now just another brick and mortar as opposed to the once amazing company they were prior to the sale.
PetSmart,1cg3ccsfoakgi9p2,4.0,"Customer care I loved seeing the animals. I learned my best experience at Petsmart I was taught by great managers on balancing my drawer, counting money phones etc."
PetSmart,1cg2mkiikakgia2v,5.0,"Good place, loved being there. Had differing views with my manager at the time, other wise I would not have left. Good job for some looking to get started working with animals."
PetSmart,1cg22sj8752skdu7,5.0,"A typical day at PetSmart was very fun, fast-paced, and productive. I learned multiple qualities that I can take with me in my future career opportunities and daily life. The management was also very professional and always gave a helping hand when in need."
PetSmart,1cfv7ipl05j4icu5,1.0,"Awful company to work for. I have been an employee there for almost 8 years and I still do not make a decent hourly wage. As a salon employee, I do not think it is fair that if I do not commission out for the week that I do not see any of that money in my paycheck. Management is incompetent and you'll get different answers from everyone. Horrible company that does not care about its employees or the animals. Was a student so I was only only working part time hours, I wanted to switch to full time during the summer but was initially denied from pursuing that for reasons I still do not understand. With all the bad PR as of lately, if you are looking to become a groomer I recommend going somewhere else."
PetSmart,1cfu5c1d31ahf49r,3.0,"As an associate, it is a great place to work. Most managers will work with you on scheduling. Depending on what shift you work, the day is super fast. The best part is taking care of the animals and helping people with their pets, to better their lives."
PetSmart,1cftobrks1ahu7d9,3.0,I loved petsmart for the experience. it made me realize that i wanted a career with animals . That's why i went on to be a veterinary assistant. I got a lot of hands on experience with the animals.
PetSmart,1cftnb6n31agv46d,3.0,"Bad hours, poor management, salary very poor. Unprofessional work environment, stresfful atmosphere, unclear assignments. Confusing pay system. Genuinely not worth the stress"
PetSmart,1cftlpjac0kbv3os,5.0,i loved working here and if it wasn't for school i'd still be here. the people were amazing including the clientele. so many things to learn if you love animals.
PetSmart,1cfrj67201ahu3pv,4.0,"There are five managers and I like three of them other than that I love my job. There was one manager that would always give me a really hard time about my work and I was an exceptional employee, the store manager loved the work I did."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1cfr4pfe31bae7ve,2.0,"Terrible place to work when I was there for the start up. Management was not competent did not know what or how to run the teammates . they kept changing hours to work if they needed 1, 2 or 3  shifts.  Did not know who was really incharge."
PetSmart,1cfqs569p1agv763,5.0,Overall a great job with great people. Management was professional and they were very helpful when you are in training. t can get hectic throughout the day and all the employers were understanding and helpful
PetSmart,1cfqr316e1ahf2o5,4.0,"The overall job culture is very fun and easy, however the hours fluctuate often and the pay isn't the best. At times it becomes boring when it's not busy but it's definitely nothing to stress out about."
PetSmart,1cfqjfkmrb84ha5u,4.0,"I truly loved working there, I loved helping people and their pets. I felt like I made a difference in peoples lives and their animals, I enjoyed interacting with the customers as well. I felt that I wasn't allowed to go into other parts of the store so I left, but I would definitely recommend petsmart to people."
PetSmart,1cfqa1jp80mcu5ks,5.0,Love my job! I love getting to see all the cute animals people bring into the store. Makes my day so much brighter! Never a dull day. Everyone is so welcoming. Work is easy and never too stressful!
PetSmart,1cfp0eben1ba13kk,4.0,"I enjoyed working here as part time. There was one problem though, I couldn’t get any more work hours because I felt I wasn’t working enough. I tried asking for more hours, but as a result they cut my hours a lot and eventually fired me."
PetSmart,1cfostuki1d0h47i,4.0,"Over-see 180 employees, 6 managers, 6 supervisors. Worked with each to set and obtain goals. Strong management culture, worked well together. Hardest part were the hours. Best part was the positive environment."
PetSmart,1cfora34t1ai135e,1.0,An awful company to work for. If you are not willing to throw people under the bus to get ahead you will never get a head. They only care about management they do not care about their employees .
PetSmart,1cfo5l7iu1d1232m,2.0,Some areas are highly over worked and you'll most likely have to work through your breaks including lunch. Proper training is key or it's just an uphill battle.
PetSmart,1cfnqer6t1ahi6ae,3.0,Fun place to work and management is great.  However there is never enough staff or hours given for staff so employees are expected to do the work of 3 people.  Staff is so over worked and burned out that turn over at this store is through the roof. New district leader puts so much stress on staff and management that everyone is always overwhelmed and exhausted.  Don't feel like managers get paid enough for what he puts them through I feel sorry for them.
PetSmart,1cfno458h0mci7kt,4.0,"I learned a lot at PetSmart about canine behavior, hard goods and pet food, and customer service. The management at my location was good."
PetSmart,1cfnna1631ai15vr,3.0,"Overall, the other employees are  very friendly and easy to get along. Expectations are very high and very hard to keep up with. Pets are allowed inside and make the job worthwhile."
PetSmart,1cflr98cb1ba16lm,4.0,Good place to work. I am a groomer so it is 50% commission. The Policies are sometimes annoying but they are there to protect you and the pets. They are not a bad company and do a lot to help pet adoptions nation wide.
PetSmart,1cfijkvdt1ai14p5,3.0,"I don't recommend working at PetSmart if you love animals, because it's guaranteed that people will be mean to their pets in front of you and you can't say anything! The management is poor and doesn't work together at all."
PetSmart,1cfi5ems70mt233k,4.0,"Really good place to work b.   People are expected to do too much. They are expected to sell animals on the floor, do register backup, take care of any customer that needs it stock shelves scrub fish tanks everyday, take care of a whole room full of sick animals, and carry a phone around it answer it.its a little much people employees are friendly and the managers are great."
PetSmart,1cfhfo7f71bg20r8,3.0,"So my experience wasn't a bad experience. The first few managers I had, coming into the job, kissed corporate's butt cheeks to make themselves look good. They were good at bending rules to make sales, they were good at spoiling customers to the point of no respect for the workers and always assuming they got free handouts or special discounts because the managers did it every time they were around. Might as well not even be a retail store, but a goodwill."
PetSmart,1cfhfedcg1ah2379,1.0,"I worked at PetSmart in Merrillville, IN for almost 2 years and here was my experience."
PetSmart,1cfh8pgdd1d020vi,5.0,"Honestly, this was my first real job outside of my fathers dental office and it was one of the best, most rewarding and responsibility driven jobs I have had. You are at the mercy of taking care of so many sweet animals that just want to be loved. One of the best jobs for a teenager!"
PetSmart,1cfgh4af51bg244t,4.0,"I enjoyed working here when I was right out of high school. It was a fun environment, but I did not have much room for growth. Nor did I have any benefits, however this was over 10 years ago and things could have changed."
PetSmart,1cfg90l5f0mci41u,5.0,This location has a great team. They are supportive and are always willing to help you learn and succeed. The managers are also approachable and very accommodating.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1cfg45v4n1ahi1q7,4.0,Getting to hang out with animals is the best part of the job. Picking a store where managers and associates that care about those animals and customers are key.
PetSmart,1cffuh5pr1bg243u,5.0,When I started the manager was willing to work with me in moving into grooming. Once being there the head manager said I was only hired for petcare and wasn't willing to help me move or grow.
PetSmart,1cfdg1mb71bg223q,2.0,I only stayed because of the people I was working under. Few benefits for part timers and little respect. I would not have stayed at this company if it were not for my coworkers.
PetSmart,1cfcabligaqhbdh0,4.0,"I've had this job for two years now and it has been great having it on the side while going to school. They have always been great about being flexible with hours and for my purposes the job pays well. My job is essentially to take care of and play with dogs, so there's no complaints there. All my coworkers have been enjoyable to work with and overall my experience at PetsMart has been very positive."
PetSmart,1cfbusje3ak9eeme,3.0,"I honestly didn't have a good experience working at petsmart. I was big and pregnant but still had to lift 50lb bags of dog food, get on my hands and knees to scrub dog feces off of floors and display cases, and didn't really get breaks."
PetSmart,1cfbu0m2obrdia8v,3.0,"I can only speak for the Beverly Hills Location. I honestly feel that if the mangers weren't under so much stress from corporate, they can actually treat their employees better."
PetSmart,1cfbpepapb81rdcc,4.0,"All the managers knew what was going on with the store and capable of clearing up issues. Good team environment, communication was a huge part in working here and everyone got along. Closing and opening are the best shifts to work, they allow the most time for employees to mingle and create a good environment."
PetSmart,1cfbhiodsb85v9uj,4.0,Loved working here with all the associates! Everyone’s friendly. The only downside is the customers who think they can do whatever and treat you wrong.
PetSmart,1cfbg9519akd9cqt,5.0,I was very young when I worked here I learned a lot about customer service and stocking merchandise. It was a great place to start learning how to be an example employee.
PetSmart,1cfb176vuakd9ctp,5.0,"I live working here, it is clean, almost everyone is extremely friendly and customers are almost always happy. I have had to diffuse a few customers but it is not too hard if you play your cards right."
PetSmart,1cf92a79las1cdd1,4.0,It is not that that stressful or fast-paced but required/expected to get things done. Managers are good and helpful never had a problem with any of them. Relaxed and friendly work days.
PetSmart,1cf8vu4lmakh7fv9,5.0,I found PetSmart to be a very unique company to work at. A company that allows employees to bring their pets to work. Where human & pets can reside at a work place.
PetSmart,1cf8qk6h752tc86q,3.0,"Basically, you do the work of at least two people and do not get paid enough for it. New hires get paid more than people that have been there 2+ years. The management asks way too much of you and cuts your hours when you ask for time off. If you're crosstrained, you are expected to do the work of both cashiers and petcare, but do not see that in your paycheck. Sometimes you're stuck on the register for eight hours at a time with your lunch break being the only relief."
PetSmart,1cf8b7n3obrdi813,5.0,"This is possibly the best company I have ever worked for. the slogan is ""where pets are family"" yet they treat employees as family too. I would highly recommend."
PetSmart,1cf88u5ksaqhbf5s,3.0,"If i had stock i would come in about 3 in the morning and as soon as we opened i was in the salon doing anything i was needed for from just clipping and filing nails to full bath, blow out, and brush. If the salon was slow i would condition shelves, help customers, run the registers, and clean anything that needed cleaning"
PetSmart,1cf6seu6ras16al5,3.0,"I enjoyed my time here but no matter how hard I worked, I felt that many policies from the corporate offices are outdated or ineffective. A lot of the policies regarding animal care could be improved upon. They work for now, but many stores have old and decaying filter systems, as well as broken enclosures that are difficult to access. Could be improved"
PetSmart,1cf6nm4vpbrd9btg,2.0,"While working in this position is pretty easy, management and the general atmosphere in the store is a big put-off.  Hours vary widely week to week and managers are not very helpful."
PetSmart,1cf5tibl0aqh6ak7,3.0,"I applied to be a stock associate, but was trained to basically work at ever part of the store. The hours are pretty inconsistent, so you won't make enough to make a living and probably want another job. It is pretty fast-paced. My managers haven't been bad and my coworkers are friendly so it isn't all bad."
PetSmart,1cf3tvg3fb81gcvq,3.0,There has been a lot of change and uncertainty. The next  two to three years will determine the future of the company.
PetSmart,1cf37q6f652t5bdk,5.0,It gave me a good experience to get myself into the work field. All the employees were nice and helpful. I got to clean cat cages and encourage customers to adopt a cat.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1cf22bhc1ak97dcg,1.0,"Managers were horrible and petty, terrible at communicating with the rest of staff. Favored specific coworkers and never gave opportunities for advandcement"
PetSmart,1cf12kgba5nd4f3v,3.0,Ok starting job. On my worst day I get yelled at scammed and clean up after dogs in the store. On my best day I am greeted by puppy kisses and cute kittens as well as new pet parents. This is a great place to see if you want to stay working with animal's. I'm currently in school for my veterinary certificate. The reason I'm choosing to leave is because it's very hard to become full-time here. In order to get my benefits I need to be full time
PetSmart,1cevfqkh4ak55elv,4.0,Management leaves a lot to be desired. They don't hire knowledgeable staff and it sucks for other pet care people to have to educate people that supposedly already knew everything. They prefer to promote externally rather than internally. They hired a new manager who had never worked at petsmart.
PetSmart,1ceuta1j6b81gf6l,3.0,"There's a lot of maintenance one must do for this job, but it was very fun and worth while.  The managers were always approachable so i felt like I could ask questions without feeling down.  The co-workers were really cool from what i remember."
PetSmart,1ceul0teuak55ekm,5.0,"Fun filled opportunity. Great atmosphere and flexibility in scheduling. Allowed an opportunity to work in a relaxed environment. Building team building skills, learning multiple positions within store. Being able to earn money & gain experience a plus."
PetSmart,1ceudb6lpakd4db8,3.0,Typical retail work environment nothing more nothing less.  Clear communication depending on management and personal feelings get confused with professionalism
PetSmart,1ceu5i6flakh2avn,2.0,Petsmart is an OK place to work. For a part time job or even a first time job. Would not recommend for a long term job. Higher up management does not resolve issues.
PetSmart,1cetopo4iaqh6efl,5.0,I loved being able to work with animals everyday. I enjoyed providing good customer service to all the customers and being able to love on all the fur babies as well!
PetSmart,1cet16dtqakd4ddf,3.0,Wasn’t getting overtime because I was never crossed train. Pay never increasing started to effect my lifestyle. Worked their for a year and 6 months . . One day I decided to part ways and find better.
PetSmart,1cessemjl5nd4fih,4.0,"It can get very stressful at times considering there were days where there was only 1 manager and 2 employees in the store at a time, but for the most part it was a fun experience where I got to take care of animals all day and meet fellow animal lovers!"
PetSmart,1cesrat7c52t5bvq,4.0,"Cashed people out in a timely and efficient manner, stocked shelves in the early morning, flexible hours, great management, most enjoyable part of the day was being able to talk with coworkers"
PetSmart,1cesfcbgfb85jdk1,5.0,working for petsmart is fun and active. youre in intetraction with many animals and humans. dealing with pet parents and pets is always a plus when you love animals.
PetSmart,1cesa8qu9b85jcf5,1.0,Petsmart was worse than Petco for me. I found they didn't care very much about their employee's or the pet's coming into their salon. I feel they could focus on safety and how important their employee's are
PetSmart,1ceqc2rqhb818fuh,3.0,"Both departments i worked within the company where fast paces, competitive and stressful. management used threats of termination to increase metrics and set nearly impossible goals."
PetSmart,1cephqijg52t2b0s,3.0,"Morning duties to be done by opening included feeding and caring for all animals (giving medication or special attention where necessary). By opening, we were expected to be ready to receive customers as they came. I learned a great deal about the care of small mammals, fish, reptiles, birds, and even the insects utilized to feed the reptiles. I also learned about different types of dog and cat food and products designed for each animal's comfort in a given situation. Management during my time sought to maintain their effectiveness in the eyes of the customers, but lacked in the cohesion they professed behind the scenes. We within the working force were cordial and helpful to one another for the most part. The hardest part of the job were often relationships with difficult repeat customers or new customers uninterested in our advice. Still, he most enjoyable part of the job for me was watching the animals grow and flourish under my care. When those few customers that did surface with the want to learn and properly care for their new animals."
PetSmart,1cenkqaduak4v9bl,4.0,I enjoyed working at Petsmart for quite awhile. Until the owners sold the company to someone new and everything became about numbers and money. We were no longer groomers but salesman. That is not the job I signed up for. There was also unfair treatment of employees. Some were favored over others.
PetSmart,1cend7gioak90chj,3.0,"PetSmart as a whole is a great company. They work with lots of rescues to find homes for homeless animals, they take great care of the animals that they do sell, and they treat their employees and customers well. My location had an unfortunate management team that failed to supervisor, encourage, or assist their team. I’ve had friends who have worked at other locations and had the exact opposite experience."
PetSmart,1cencp7s8ak4vb2u,4.0,"It takes a special kind of person to have the patience and ability to work with animals who are out of their element and often times not happy about the necessary work being done on them to get a decent haircut and service. I learned to calm myself in stressful situations, connect with customers about their pets and the ins and outs of the grooming process and amount of time it can take to do the job safely. The salon becomes a family and close relationships are formed between everyone who works there."
PetSmart,1cenagrkdb855c1d,4.0,Petsmart is a great place to work with a great culture and very nice coworkers  but the business has model has some big challenges. Amazon will eventually eliminate the merchandise business which accounts for 85 percent of petsmart revenue
PetSmart,1cen8ctnibrcucmc,4.0,Fast paced work environment. Worked 4-10 hour shifts and had Friday Saturday and Sunday off. Had a sale 2 times a year where you could buy discounted products really cheap.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1cemucethb892bq6,2.0,grooming salon is stressful and they groomers are jerks. the petshotel was amazing and loved their jobs. groomers were always getting over booked and getting behind . the management expect to much from the employees in the grooming . They DONT communicate professionally or courteously. BUT petshotel was awesome and friendly .
PetSmart,1celvci6daqgva17,4.0,I have a love hate relationship with petsmart.  Love it because when working with animals you dont feel like you are not at work. Dislike it because i was expected to go above and beyond  my job description but still paid the minimum.
PetSmart,1cekgksm05ncuccs,4.0,Pet smart was a very good company to work for. They give you many opportunities to learn many different things They also have a great management system. They also have many great charities  and help adopt pet pets.i Think this is a good company to work for all around.
PetSmart,1cef499ivb8129vl,4.0,I learned a lot about the animals I worked with and it was an experience that I'm glad I had but I dont wish to do again. There was quite a bit of labor involved and no matter how much I cleaned it was never really clean which was the worst part not including the low hours and lack of recgonition for tasks.
PetSmart,1ceev31b6akct944,3.0,"A typical day at work consisted of mostly tasking. Team members, including myself, would spend our time assisting customers, putting product away, and fixing up the store at the end of the night. In between breaks from classes I would assist my coworkers in these tasks."
PetSmart,1ceefknqrak4vem3,5.0,I love seeing all the pets that walk in the door.We always have fun  events for the pets on the holidays. We always strive to have a good time and make it a fun environment.It feel awesome when yo can work with people who love what they do just as much as yo do. Employees are always in a great mood and always ready to assist the customers.
PetSmart,1cecqu0rvak90a02,5.0,Just a simple job of stocking by bringing the truck from the back ware-room and working the pallets to the shelf while listening to music on the overhead.
PetSmart,1cecqgat952svfv0,3.0,"In grooming you are able to build a career for yourself by retaining a clientele, but between management and corp constantly adding on more demands to the work load, it's physically and mentally draining. If you can deal with it the benefits are great."
PetSmart,1cec7b87uakct9nf,2.0,"As a petsmart bather you are supplied the tools you need in order to compete the job,however they are not your tools to take home so often times they end up missing or broken. Management seems to have little care for the work environment, and in my time there the rooms I've worked in have all but fallen apart. Store manager seems to have little idea of the day to day small details that help keep the salon working."
PetSmart,1cec0ic0eak4va5r,4.0,"I was only here a year, but during that time I had a blast. I met many people who I am still friends with today."
PetSmart,1ce93gcmj5n91f8t,4.0,"The people you work for are great, management is pretty decent.  The work load and pace is a bit much, but manageable if you stay focused. You will get tired of hearing your voice and the headsets voice though."
PetSmart,1ce8083l9b850c9r,2.0,"Petsmart is a great place for a teenagers first job, but if your are management things play quickly into politics and the backstabbing is increcredible."
PetSmart,1ce803ba0b88tdu9,3.0,"at petsmart, the grooming salon fluctuates on the actual pace of business and it is pretty competitive since you want as many appointments as possible since you make commission. I don't believe the commission was enough or was fair"
PetSmart,1ce7uk8ds5n8ud4n,5.0,"It was a great experience I liked the people I worked with, very helpful and don’t mind showing you things hands on, answer questions and all. Very big and spacious, work to yourself, didn’t have to work in groups very nice overall"
PetSmart,1ce7l5bk0b850885,4.0,A typical day at Petsmart starts with greeting the line of people that are more ready to be there than you are. It is getting to meet different people and different dogs and providing a safe and fun environment for both pet parents and their pets. I enjoyed my time at my first store and I am looking forward to meeting the Petsmart team in Tempe.
PetSmart,1ce7jk3205j4pfa6,3.0,"Petsmart is a great place to work if you want experience working with animals. Most management is pretty terrible and corrupt by corporation and money. Most of the people that work for Petsmart are compassionate towards all animals and great employees but you know the saying ""a bad manager can take a good staff and destroy it"" that is most Petsmarts."
PetSmart,1ce7ilm895n8ubm3,3.0,"This is by far not the worst company I have worked for, but it's definitely a place where people feel burnt out, myself included. The hours are long, you work a lot of days, and the pay isn't great. Some of the customers are obnoxious, and oftentimes you will have to go on breaks/off shift a few minutes late. The positive is that I did have great coworkers and okay management. If this is a temporary job, then this will be fine. This is definitely not a place for long-term employment, however."
PetSmart,1ce7e5s6a5n8u9f4,3.0,"There are generally no benefits. The best thing my job has to offer is that I get to work with dogs. The only way to have a full-time job in the grooming salon is to be a full-certified dog groomer, and the only way to advance as a dog groomer is to have a 2-year contract with PetSmart, for which you get paid hourly until you groom 200 specific dogs and then go through 6 months of 40% commission, upon which you will then get 50% of commission. My coworker currently making the most there gets about $1200 a week, and that's by taking at least 10 dogs a day, which is extremely stressful--most groomers here don't dare go over six. Is it worth the stress, let alone the lack of benefits?"
PetSmart,1ce77ndmrak8sa5g,4.0,"PetSmart is a fast paced, easy to work job. The hardest part is higher up jobs such as pet care and management positions. The most enjoyable part is connecting with other pet parents who have a passion for their pets."
PetSmart,1ce714rgmas0sbg4,4.0,"Good place to work if you love people and also animals, being able to help pet parents with their question is alsways a plus. Manger scheduling could be better and also the turnover rate is fairly high"
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1ce6u3ejiakcqb8k,1.0,"This is the job for you! Poor management and slack co-workers, nobody cares about animals, only policy! Is it policy to save this animals life? No? To the freezer! Its policy policy policy!"
PetSmart,1ce4sg7nrb88qdk5,3.0,I loved working at PetSmart and would still love to work there now if not for the low paw. They do not hire full time employees but expect you to have open availability which is not feasible if you need to work to live.
PetSmart,1ce47n7f0ak4of4a,1.0,"The work itself isn't that stressful or strenuous, but the poor management means you end up having to do more than your fair share of work without any real consequences for pushing work off on to others."
PetSmart,1ce3cv74ub80pa2p,5.0,They work with you if u truelly work for them. I cant explain how thankful I am to be with this company! I wish they had a store where i want to go....
PetSmart,1ce1r0e3q5n8p93d,3.0,"Pay sucks, the rules change every time a new DM is hired, and there is no place for advancement. My manager is wonderful and really cares about the employees, but corporate does not. The job was fast paced but fun. The best part is definitely the relationship that is formed between you and the pets and their parents."
PetSmart,1ce1puaf1brcmfp0,4.0,I have learned a lot about animals at my current job at Petsmart. I enjoy my coworkers and some of the customers I have been able to help and meet on a daily basis. Its quick with getting to every customer and grabbing products for people. Also when stocking it is very fast and efficient pace to move things quick but also keep things organized.
PetSmart,1ce1eh0j7b88qarh,2.0,Poor store manager creating a negative work environment. Employees are made to feel like they can never do a good enough job. Hours are given to favorites.
PetSmart,1ce0jt79rak4o9vf,1.0,The girls are extremely catty and unmotivated to work. Every person in that grooming salon complains about everything and always made inappropriate comments about the animals to no exceptions of customers being present. Employees are rude and act as if them selves are more superior then customers. Management encourages behavior. Won’t cut cats nails because of personal dislike of cats.
PetSmart,1ce040mbrak8pdss,4.0,Management is overall awesome. Days go by fast. Fun place to work. There can be some slow days but the team makes it fun. Overall would recommend anyone work there that loves animals.
PetSmart,1cdvq27s7ak4oba4,4.0,The GM is a nice guy-tough but nice! Assistant mgr is annoying lol
PetSmart,1cdt2f4l7aqgpbhg,4.0,"Typical days are usually busy, between check-ins and check-outs, grooming, play times, and minding Doggy Day Camp. Our previous manager was good, but our current manager is a bit of a lame duck and seems to frequently misunderstand me. The physicality is the hardest part of the job; it is loud and can be smelly and dirty, plus I am on my feet for up to eight hours a day. The staff is very friendly, and they all show a clear commitment to the pets in our care. Plus, getting to play with dogs and cats all day is hard to beat."
PetSmart,1cdsn71035j4lc4i,5.0,A good day at work for is keeping busy.    The management recognizes you when you are a good worker . Even though I was only there a short time I felt that helping customers was the most rewarding feeling
PetSmart,1cds92vulas0pf53,5.0,"My time at PetSmart was enjoyable and will always have a place in my heart. I just needed to move and needed more money and more freedom to do that. I smiled every day from not only the animals, but from positive customers as well."
PetSmart,1cdql1cugakcnehv,4.0,"As a cashier, I rang up customers at the register, restocked and maintained shelves, and helped with basic cleaning (vacuuming, mopping). The workplace environment was pretty relaxed, and the managers were accommodating."
PetSmart,1cdq00s7sb80pch9,4.0,Petsmart is a great company work with I would highly recommend them to anybody That atmosphere is very fun to work and the people are great I would definitely recommend this company to anybody to work for they are very family orientated and just all-around a great place
PetSmart,1cdpolcdmaqgpdim,3.0,"On a typical day the staff was limited. Only one petcare associate, one cashier, one or two managers and no customer service associate. As busy as the store gets at times, the lack of staff really becomes a burden on other associates especially when there are multiple tasks that need to be accomplished."
PetSmart,1cdpliap8ak4of08,3.0,"The store was always short staffed, and between working trucks, setting plan o grams and doing pricing and planner very frequently the store fell behind. The workload expected each month would be easy to maintain with just an extra employee or two to help, but corporate was always cutting hours so we were never able to hire anyone new."
PetSmart,1cdo73a91as0p8l9,1.0,Worst place !
PetSmart,1cdo6ug695j4ldas,5.0,"I enjoy working here it is a great environment however, you must have at the least a like for animals or at least be interested in them though because you will encounter them daily."
PetSmart,1cdnrsdv4akcnfh4,4.0,"Great company that really strives for a good relationship with customers and also employees at the establishment. Payment could be higher for amount of work one does. However, is a very enjoyable job"
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1cdnjq64pb80pd03,2.0,Teams are making strides to restore the fun and exciting culture that he company was known to have in the 2000s.
PetSmart,1cdnea3955ncm8gk,4.0,I loved the job was fasted apce only down fall when I went on medical leave for a hernia they let me go upon returning to work adnt old me to reapply after 6 months
PetSmart,1cdne2ssdakgmcbl,3.0,Enjoyable parts of the job: Tons of pets to greet and interact with
PetSmart,1cdn9qlmaakcnd21,4.0,I drove a reach truck and it was a little stressful at times but It wasn't a bad job. I didn't apply for any other jobs and maybe I should have. I could have probably picked in the shipping department.
PetSmart,1cdmmplpr5n8pdgd,5.0,"Not a bad job just wish the pay was a bit higher. Depending on what you apply you will be very physical. Good discounts, fun animals, good customers but managers need work."
PetSmart,1cdl47jaf1aid3q1,4.0,"PetSmart is a good solid company to work for, If you aren't afraid of hard work  The management is fair in their dealings with the employees. What you see is what you get."
PetSmart,1cdl1mgma0mtf70s,3.0,They refuse to hire more employees for full time so it's hard to make rent every month with the amount of hours I get. Plus we are low staffed so opening pet care can be a challenge and not everything always gets done. The managers are very nice though and working with animals is great.
PetSmart,1cdkjo8se1aht1ve,5.0,The hardest part of working is working weekends. The managers there are not the best. The only manager that was amazing is the grooming salon manager.
PetSmart,1cdjptufsb88h8or,3.0,"Decent place to work. Although corporate tries to get the job done with as little people as possible. Often understaffed,and the work life balance was not great."
PetSmart,1cdjbg9kr1bge1cg,4.0,"PetSmart can be a fun place, to learn more about the animals and products in store. It also depends on your team. It can get busy at times and can be slow at times as well. I would normally be running back and forth from the cashier to pet care a lot because we were short staffed for a while and I was the only pet care associate scheduled during my shift."
PetSmart,1cdj77h821baf2eg,3.0,A great place to work if you are looking for something part time or a stepping stone to retail.  Hard to advance and poor pay for lower management. The pets and customers is what makes it easy to get through the day.
PetSmart,1cdin1b7i1bge7c6,4.0,I've been employed with PetSmart for three years and have a positive work experience in this organization.  Unfortunately me commute has become burdensome and I need to work closer to home.
PetSmart,1cdimah5r0kbs0lk,5.0,"I enjoyed working at PetSmart, Great company to work for. Lots of room for advancement, Great coworkers, Leader, and supervisors. Friendly place, clean."
PetSmart,1cdiljpfj0mtq017,5.0,I worked as a Pet Trainer at another location for over two years. I transferred and the management at my new location was absolutely horrible. I loved my job and took a pay cut to be a Pet Trainer. After the transfer I was miserable. Management is key. Otherwise the company is GREAT! Training dogs is GREAT! Dealing with micromanagers is HORRIBLE.
PetSmart,1cdiil65v1agu1fq,1.0,"not a recommendation for this company, the focus is not on the animals..  it’s focused on sales and they get their small animals from animal farms and they are normally sick when they arrive"
PetSmart,1cdih67tj1aht50m,4.0,It was a shame for me when I left. I really enjoyed my clients and most people I worked with. There was no real career advancement especially if they like you were your at.
PetSmart,1cdi7udd01agu3qv,4.0,The managers and other co-workers would help the newer hire on to help them do a better job in the field. Managers knew what they were doing and would help when a situation arise.
PetSmart,1cdgv657q0kbs5ev,4.0,This job was an overall fun job and I enjoyed my time spent with the animals. The management was okay but seemed a little cliquey. The Petsmart company was great though.
PetSmart,1cdg7mr5p0kbs3ip,4.0,Pet care has a lot of tasks to complete on top of handling customers and caring for ALL the store's animals. I enjoyed the fast pace. I learned everything from my store manager and an associate who'd been there for 20 years. SM left and new SM and ASM are unfit for their positions and no number of HR calls or investigations have changed this. I have moved out of the sales floor and into the salon and haven't dealt with much more managerial shenanigans as the salon manager is amazing.
PetSmart,1cdg6m1411d0c47a,5.0,Great place to work. Great staff and amazing management. Only bummer is how greedy corporate management is and how annoying all the donation drives are.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1cdg3sc141baf3ih,5.0,"I've been working as a cashier at PetSmart for about 5 months now, and I absolutely love it! The work is not hard, but can be stressful at times. The management is great, and they are willing to work around school or other job schedules. This is a great job to have while you're in school."
PetSmart,1cdg2dpfm0kbs49e,3.0,"The rollover is ridiculously high, especially Store management. They have little to no communication skills. Plus there is no gray area for termination. sometime it takes months to fire a bad employee and a few days for a good one."
PetSmart,1cdfqrosr1aht0es,4.0,I had fun while working here while studying for my future career. The work was heavy when it got busy or when it was receiving day for animals or inventory but overall a great atmosphere. All the managers are as accommodating as can be for college students but do keep in mind you need to afford gas and try to give you decent hours. They had a fun and inclusive way of making their staff feel more like team members than workers.
PetSmart,1cdfah9190mtf61o,5.0,"I absolutely loved working  for this company, if you have any interest in pets and need extra income this is the job to have. feels good knowmulting the animals need you,fun to play with throughout the day. also sharing your love for animals with others."
PetSmart,1cdekqlomb88h8dn,2.0,hours were super inconsistent because i was “part time” and they wouldnt let me have a more set schedule. boring. people who have worked there longer can do whatever but if you do something they do you get in trouble. all cashiers/floor people/ pet department are part time only. have to clock on ON the dot ONE minute early or one minute late will get you in trouble
PetSmart,1cde655gn0mtq2ce,3.0,It has plenty of its ups and downs. Over the years i been then everything has been changed and from my point of view is just bad. Management got bad. Employees started leaving and they hire people with less experience but pay them more. I been there for over 2 years n still havent got my 1 year raise.
PetSmart,1cde2rhd00kbs1g8,2.0,Glad to work with animals- too bad they do not have full time positions for all.  Like to handle the reptiles and cats. Like helping get the cats adopted.
PetSmart,1cdcbuf191agu0ul,5.0,Great place to work I would recommend anyone to apply here. The hours are great the people are friendly. They treat everyone like family. If you love pets than this is the place for you.
PetSmart,1cdc0l2hf1aid1j3,2.0,"Everybody knows everything that's going on all the time, there is no separation of personal and work life. Very high school type environment, lots of gossip and rumors. Management would threaten with write up and termination as scare tactics to get what they wanted and if you did get to a write up you had to sign or face termination for insubordination for little things. Lots of gossip within the salon and nothing was confidential, management would talk about personal files with other employees management or staff. Other employees call out or no call no show so often your days off will be taken so they can have theirs, overtime is common but you can face write up for overtime if they feel like they want to. Would not recommend at all to anyone."
PetSmart,1cdbmq9pv1bge3dj,3.0,enjoyed learning about exotic pets help me find a job with lionville  vet hospital because I use to take sick animals from petsmart to them.  left to work full time at lionville vet hospital.
PetSmart,1cdb8d4001agu1ov,5.0,Really enjoyed being able to work with animals everyday.  The other employees were friendly and team players. Required a lot to be a team leader but it was worth it and made sure I knew what was required of me
PetSmart,1cdagt8nf0kbs5n5,4.0,It was a good work environment with competitive pay. It does tend to get stressful sometimes working in the grooming salon and can be challenging to work with misbehaved dogs.
PetSmart,1cdaem0v71aht2f0,4.0,"I love PetSmart all the people that I work with are wonderful and helpful. It was a great experience to learn about animals and working here, it got me to put my dog on a better food, so thank you. However, with my pay I cannot move out on my own."
PetSmart,1cd82frv01aid1r4,3.0,PetSmart was a rewarding experience in learning about handling pets and properly taking care of them. I also interacted with many people from many different walks of life and learned a lot.
PetSmart,1cd822kqb1d0c14t,4.0,It was fun to be given the chance to take care of animals and teaches you a lot of responsibility. I really enjoyed the working environment and the discount was helpful since I have pets of my own.
PetSmart,1cd7d6l8e1aid037,4.0,Like any other job there are pros and con. The main pro for me is getting to work with animals. The only con is the pay is not sufficient for all the work they have us do. If it wasn't for the pay it would be a great job. You definitely have to be quick and hardworking to keep up with the workload around holidays.
PetSmart,1cd6utvpf1aht71a,4.0,"My store manager is a good person but i just don't think he knows what he's doing, and the assistant manager is very lazy and hardly works at all. My coworkers are easy to get along with for the most part, and I like being able to help people and their pets."
PetSmart,1cd6idrjob84jd4s,5.0,Best part of the jobs were all the animals. Worst part of the job was you couldn't really explore different positions. Could not evolve into something more.
PetSmart,1cd5u5p111ahe5dg,5.0,"I loved that I got to work with animals everyday and getting to see different breeds of dogs everyday. I also learned a lot about some other animals. Now, I have my own breaded dragon. All the information that I need to know to take care of him I learned from working at PetSmart."
PetSmart,1cd5r3oep1ahe6mb,4.0,"Very fun place to work, relaxed, and you get to know your coworkers well. There is some difficulties to the job, same with any other, but the competitiveness is fun and exciting."

PetSmart,1cd5brrjp1agu1b5,3.0,"There is no typical day at work with PetSmart. Some associates know exactly what their job duties are and others don't until they clock in. For the most part, the management team is good. However, they give more ""Atta Boy's"" than raises and/or promotions. The most enjoyable part of working at PetSmart are the animals: dogs, cats, bird, reptiles, small animals, fish, etc. Helping a pet parent find what they are looking for is rewarding."
PetSmart,1cd58c0re1bge0pk,5.0,"When your products and services involve live things, you'll never know what every day brings. From the pets you carry, to the service dogs in the salon and hotel, you will never be bored. and have challenges and joys every day!"
PetSmart,1cd3n4vfu1bad3ng,4.0,"Good policies, benefits are better than most retailers, opportunity for advancement. Great coworkers, plenty of animals, employee discounts for products (great if you own pets), fast paced"
PetSmart,1cd3mjv8e1bgb6ea,5.0,sometimes trying to get resets done on-time cause be over welming because they don't allow enough hours to complete the task. management is pretty easy to get along with.
PetSmart,1cd33dlnrb84hfsq,3.0,The head manager was unwilling to work with anyone when it came to scheduled hours or requested time off. He made you feel like you were always doing something wrong.
PetSmart,1cd2o0fb8b84h8u9,4.0,My positions were challenging and I enjoyed my time at Petsmart. When I was there they went from a small company to being on the stock exchange so I saw a lot of growth with this company.
PetSmart,1cd1frd2a1bad3kp,4.0,Put pressure on everybody to sell training classes..merchandise was to be worked fast. .Working with the animals was fun and stressful when they became sick.
PetSmart,1cd181d600kbq3hj,4.0,"The pets hotel was fast-paced; unless there were a good amount of employees (like transitioning between shifts) there was always something to be done. If you do not know dogs or fear dogs., do not try the pet hotel."
PetSmart,1cd14opfk1ahb51v,5.0,"I enjoyed working as a store manager. It was challenging every day and my team was great.  You get out what you put in.  During my time there I had a few different bosses and we adapted just fine. As a whole, it's a great place to work if you like working in teams and love pets."
PetSmart,1cd10nr0o1d094m7,5.0,"It is a peaceful environment and usually your coworkers are flexible and will work with you for shift pickups, etc. Its a relaxed type of job to have."
PetSmart,1cd0u69rs0mtc76e,1.0,The reason I had left Petsmart was that the environment was to tense and unfair. I worked long hours with short breaks. I was also sent to the hospital and the management was giving me issues in paying for the hospital bill.
PetSmart,1cd0o4oqu1agr6g3,3.0,"I started as a cashier and was promoted to management. My store manager was terrible and had a 100% turnover rate. The pet care department is fun to work in, but corporate demands so much but gives you so little to do it with. It's really not about the animals but how much money you can make them which is sad."
PetSmart,1cd0j7ahv1agr02t,1.0,"Horrible management never work there they treat their employees badly they treat each other terrible. their manager has no clue what they are doing, there is no support"
PetSmart,1cd08pqir1ahq07s,3.0,"the co-workers are pleasant, the facility was always nice and clean. They provide all the tools needed for grooming and bathing animals. The management need training on motivation and professionalism."
PetSmart,1ccun834m5nd0cg8,1.0,"I cleaned dirty animal caged and medicated sick animals in the morning. In the morning around 9am customers came in, I had to advise them about the best pet based on a few different things. The store manager I had was pretty good, not great. The supervisors were not good. The supervisor of the petcare department was especially worthless. There really was not much of a culture. Hardest part of the job was the incompetent supervisors. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting to talk with and work with pet parents and their pets."
PetSmart,1ccui445nas0r9d5,5.0,Amazing job for people in school and need a side part time job with super flexible schedule. Pay is great and the amount of workload is nothing compared to any other job super easy!
PetSmart,1ccuhet8a5nd0a7j,4.0,"I was supposed to go to Grooming Academy to become a professional groomer and I was told 5 separate times that I would go as part of salon manager training and that I would be evaluated and sent as soon as possible. Come time for my evaluations and I was then told that I was not ready to go to academy, yet no specifics were given. When asked for help refining my skills and preparing for my evaluations, promise were made and then broken. I have also experience manager retaliation for standing up for myself and my career more than once. Have your resume ready, because if you stand up for yourself in any way, management will make your life a living nightmare."
PetSmart,1ccua8qup1d125nd,5.0,Fun and caring place. if you love being around animals its great or as a job while in school. Always lots to do not much down time so make sure you don't want a lazy job.
PetSmart,1cctunq221d12439,2.0,The job itself was nice but the way corporate runs things makes everything stressful and hard to handle.They only hire for part time positions so having this job as a main source of income in not feasible to live on. They often cut or changed my hours without any kind of notification which caused confusion on multiple occasions.
PetSmart,1cctppk9u1d12579,5.0,"If you love animals, PetSmart is definitely a great place to start out in, the people are friendly and the employees are usually there for the same reasons as you. If there is a PetsHotel, I highly suggest applying there."

PetSmart,1cctfggc4ak4r8g6,3.0,"I started at PetSmart as a Pet Care Associate, but changed to the Dog Trainer when the previous one quit. It is a very slow location and not many hours are offered."
PetSmart,1ccscgra9ak8renj,1.0,"Petsmart has really changed over the years. Unless if you have it good with your bosses and have a mean attitude you aren't to fit in. Co-workers gossip, aren't friendly (even to customers), and have sexually harassed along with made the environment uncomfortable for other workers. It doesn't matter if you are a good worker or not either, you don't get promoted/crossed trained unless co-workers and bosses like you as a person over work ethics. The discount is low for a store that is expensive to shop in. Bosses also constantly remind you how replaceable you are if you don't meet their expectations. Good place to shop only for their wide variety of available products. Not a good place to work at all."
PetSmart,1ccrpn7b71d123t1,5.0,"Working at Petsmart provides excellent opportunity to learn about animal care for pets of all types, as well as nutrition and training information, and allows you the opportunity to work with the public to better care for their furry family members as well."

PetSmart,1ccj2j7stakgp9ae,3.0,"I learned a great deal about what pressures can do to management and how their steam blows off onto the employees. With a great experience in dealing with live animals and customer care, there wasn't much to complain about other than the attitude of the managers and the pressures of up-selling to customers whose feedback is nothing but complaints of workers doing just that."
PetSmart,1cci2ievbb88mbvf,4.0,The job isn’t hard however the grooming department is not worth it. I was there for 3 years at first I loved it. Everyone was like family before we had a massive shift in leadership
PetSmart,1cchs6kisas0r897,3.0,"Every Monday and Thursday we received a freight truck that needed to be unloaded and stocked. I was in charge of unloading the truck with the forklift and stocking the product. Management was always claiming we were not fast enough, when all employees stocking were doing about twice the speed we were required by the book. It was a very tiring job, many of the items were very heavy (fish tanks, stands, dog food, etc) and there were a lot of items to be stocked."
PetSmart,1cchmvt9v52t0asn,5.0,loved my time at pets smart only draw back was lack of pay other then that my str manger was amazing and very fair. great balance of work and family life.
PetSmart,1cchlbhouas0r9pa,4.0,You make decent money but need to be prepared for a fast pace environment with high levels of stress mainly on the weekends in the grooming salon atleast.
PetSmart,1cch2tk9m52t08a5,3.0,"Pet Smart was a fast paced sales environment. The work was pretty easy, but the pay was not that great and they don't pay enough, or provide enough benefits"
PetSmart,1ccfdt75uakgp8ge,4.0,I wouldn't always recommend this place. It was not the best place to work but it wasn't absolutely terrible. The management was my main issue. They didn't have the best management.
PetSmart,1ccfajghvb8169qf,4.0,One of my most favorite jobs. Loved being around all the different animals and getting a chance to learn about different care techniques and needs for all the species.
PetSmart,1cceln574ak8rdo7,5.0,"I really liked my job at petsmart. It is a very fun-filled first job and if you like it enough, there is more than one way to advance throughout the company."
PetSmart,1ccecbdcj5n90ct8,2.0,"Orderfilling is a very stressful job. You get moved from racks to the mod. Extremely fast paced. Expect 100% production at all times. If you take a bathroom break, it severely affects your production time (and the bathrooms are across the warehouse). They do not give you time for switching job functions which causes a decrease in production stats. Drop off for orders are even timed which is difficult if there is a lot of traffic, if the orders are light (because they don't like to come off of the PIT forks), or if no one visibly labels the order lines because you can't see the number of the store you have to drop on which line so you have to get off of your lift to go search for the correct line to drop in. You get very little time to complete orders. They do not give you downtime for some of the things that are the managements fault like switching job functions, no tasks, having to pull boxes to complete orders, switching lifts, etch."
PetSmart,1cceas9lmak4r8u2,3.0,Great team
PetSmart,1cce9877ab816cea,5.0,"I loved helping pet owners help find what they were looking for, as well as meeting their sweet little fur -- or even scaly -- babies! Seeing families leave with a new addition to their family, whether it be from the wide variety PetSmart has to offer, or from all the great adoption agencies that come to visit, always warms my heart. Animals with their forever families is what makes working in any kind of animal related job absolutely worth while!"
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.

PetSmart,1ccc1e1ljaqgp9lg,4.0,petsmart is great. A lot of hard work. you are caring for other peoples animals. but you have a lot of fun.  Just need something that works better for my family schedule.
PetSmart,1ccc175ko5nd0a3i,5.0,"Friendly coworkers who are very supportive, always organizing/fronting shelves, greeting customers within 3 feet is a rule. There's always something to do, no one was ever standing around with nothing to do."
PetSmart,1ccbphnke52t0cl7,2.0,"The management, both at a store level and corporate level is what's going to make or break your job. If you're working there part time it's ok but if you plan on making it a career you should probably go somewhere else. I was never offered advancement and people outside of the company were hired to glide through my job and advance. After much upset I caused at multiple levels nothing was done. Not to mention those who were hired at my job with no experience were hired at a higher hourly wage than me who had been working there for years."
PetSmart,1ccbhm0gp5nd0c0r,3.0,PetSmart asks a lot of experienced employees but doesn't exactly expect the same from new employees. The work load is not balanced. Not ideal for a long term job.
PetSmart,1ccacn8daas0rbsg,3.0,"Working at petsmart is okay for a seasonal position if you just need extra cash. Getting paid weekly was a plus, however, management was beyond horrible. Their turnover rate is insanely high and they are never adequately staffed."
PetSmart,1cc97t07qaqgpe6r,4.0,"Go in with management, clock in and get started. Learned about animals and there needs. Management was good. Not a hard job at all. The pets was the most fun"

PetSmart,1cc7evgibakcpdm8,2.0,"Not able to take any breaks, get harassed during lunches, willing to work around some employees schedules and not others. Used to be a fairly easy going job, that changed when management kept changing."
PetSmart,1cc74ilcgaqgpffr,4.0,"Overall I got to play and be around animals all day, which is a dream. Most people were very nice and fun. Had your good and bad coworkers/management. You need to love animals to be able to do the job, not uncommon to be cross-trained."
PetSmart,1cc71ii1d5j4r8vd,3.0,"I worked as a product associate (stocker) and cashier for a little over a year. My typical day consisted of coming in at 4am (sometimes earlier depending on holidays) and leaving around 10am, after working as cashier once the store opened. I learned a lot about inventory control and management, as well as strict time management."
PetSmart,1cc57fnotaqgpc1j,5.0,"Easy work. Customers and co workers are nice. Only mangers can get 40 hours per week. We have animal hospital, grooming salon, but no pet hotel. I like working here."

PetSmart,1cc47pqjgak4rbmb,4.0,Worked there for 8 years. I saw a lot of improvements and a lot of set backs.
PetSmart,1cc45gvr85n90asu,5.0,You learn so much at Petsmart while your time there. Information that follows you even after you stop working there. I loved working with all the animals and greeting all the pet parents.
PetSmart,1cc43efhkakcp9mm,1.0,this company sucks the life out of you do not under any circumstances work here it is full of little kids who are not capable of working a job let alone
PetSmart,1cc3b7m9c5nd0ab0,3.0,Only way to really make money is being a salon groomer who breaks their backs and over work your self. You don’t get paid enough for the hard labor you have to do. It’s a very tough job. Management Is hard to deal with since you never know if they are lying or telling the truth .
PetSmart,1cc2u7785b85fbc8,4.0,I have learned a lot about pet behavior and learning to deal with clients. My co-workers are helpful and always there when I need help. Petsmart has been a good learning experience.
PetSmart,1cc223fkpak8q88n,4.0,I liked working at PetSmart. The people were really friendly and I loved working with the animals and assisting the customers. I enjoyed my time there.
PetSmart,1cc1u02l9ak8qb7v,4.0,"I feel working retail anywhere anymore is going to require someone that can handle a disgruntled customer effectively. It would be the same as working in the service industry. A typical day at work for me would involve customer service and interaction. I needed to know how to spot critical signs of stress for dogs and cats, and act quickly should the situation call for it. The vast majority of managers are very helpful, and willing to help solve problems with you."
PetSmart,1cc1pc871ak8qa4f,4.0,•  A typical day at work was enjoyable and fast going.

PetSmart,1cc1odlhgaqgo8n1,3.0,"I did not enjoy working at this job. I did; however, enjoy working with the animals and getting to take care of the clients' pets that they would bring in."
PetSmart,1cc1nvktb5j4qchj,3.0,It can be fun but you are constantly trying to do a million things at once while helping customers. I went from work 20 hours a week to now if I'm lucky I get 8-12. Petsmart is flexible with hours but best as a 2nd job or a starting job when you have no bills to pay. No real room for growth and breaks are often skipped due to lack of coverage unless you have to take a lunch.
PetSmart,1cc1l7tu952svap9,5.0,Great company very fun work place that took care of their leaders.  Very strong on safety and standard work.  Great job promoting from within and having great work life balance.
PetSmart,1cc1j1oai5j4qejs,5.0,The staff at PetSmart is very friendly and helpful. Since coming to work with PetSmart they have enabled and helped me advance my career. They even paid for a trip for my training.
PetSmart,1cc1g14raakgoaj9,4.0,"If you love pets, its a great place to work. Compensation is fair, but daily hours provided for running the store are too low. When someone calls in it creates a stressful environment for the staff."
PetSmart,1cc06eubp5ncu9tg,3.0,It was a very good place to work. However I would much rather tell you in person of the experience that got me here and I can assure you that it will be easily understood.
PetSmart,1cbvlk2vkak4p99j,2.0,"I can only speak for the store I worked at, as a company PetSmart gives benefits and fair pay. Although the management was awful and ultimately the reason I quit. They push you beyond your limits and do not care about personal needs. Its all about making as much money as possible and making sales plan."
PetSmart,1cbvbr8m85ncudqf,5.0,"Most of the day center around customer service and the pets that comes into the store, Coaching the associates and teaching them how to drive sales through getting the customers to the items they are seeking and getting add on sales. Also making sure the trucks are getting to the floor to make sure we have the merchandise on the floor for the customers. For me my job was to see that we had the schedule completed on time so the associates new when they were working and to have power hours covered each day. Our culture was a culture of care for our customers and associates. The hardest part of the job is just making sure all planners and pogs get completed. I enjoy working with people and seeing the pets when they come into the store and also training the associates on the proper way of getting things done the right way."
PetSmart,1cbuh193cak8p87c,2.0,I left because the management wasn't fair. Some managers were very rude and selfish while others cared a lot about the staff. I couldn't take working somewhere where my direct manager couldn't take the stress of being a manager and having to do her regular job
PetSmart,1cbtvnh20b8148bp,1.0,after being an loyal trust worthy employee for a certan amount of years you are maxed out on pay. and are expexted to go the extra mile for little conniption
PetSmart,1cbsa50k0akgncfk,3.0,"PetSmart is a great first job to get your feet wet in the ""retail"" sales positions. Retail is all about basic product knowledge, while respecting the customer and having and maintaining a great attitude."
PetSmart,1cbruj3sgak4peki,2.0,"The store I worked at had a lot of drama, people would go off on you about very minute things in front of customers and other employees; management did not do very much to correct it. Breaks were not given at all at times; as a female breaks are necessary to deal with hygiene issues. I ruined two sets of pants because of this lack of flexibility. I worked there for about 3+ years, and after some management changes there was a lot of unnecessary unprofessional attitude."
PetSmart,1cbqsm9ktak8mc1d,3.0,"I was a PetCare Associate and a Bather at Petsmart and I feel like, under the improper management, it's very stressful. The company wants you to get so much stuff done in such a short amount of time, and it's only one associate per shift so everything is up to you. My store manager was very rude and didn't seem to care about anyone at all. Many times I debated contacting HR and now I'm regretting that I didn't."
PetSmart,1cbqq1ptib810drm,2.0,"While working at PetSmart, I enjoyed being able to work with animals hands on, and that was the only part of my job that I was able to enjoy. While my coworkers were great, the management was not understanding, and made it impossible to enjoy my job otherwise."
PetSmart,1cbqp61bvbrctbhb,2.0,the company was not enjoyable to work for at my store. we did not get many breaks and were pressured to do more work than we had time to do or felt comfortable doing.
PetSmart,1cbo7k47u52sq82o,4.0,Loved my co-workers and thoroughly enjoyed my first experience in a retail setting. Working with the pets and parents was awesome. I would and might return in the future.
PetSmart,1cbnu7b62as0metu,5.0,Good people to work with
PetSmart,1cbnf62f7ak8m8lf,2.0,Often times the stock room was so unsanitary it made me think twice about how much they truly cared for the pets they claimed to love during the interview process. (The reason I joined initially.)
PetSmart,1cbnabc4j5ncqc5f,4.0,I am retired so for me it was fun working at Pet Smart.  Would recommend it highly for someone looking for part-time work.  I was a cashier.  I liked helping the customers.  There wasn't anything hard about working at Pet Smart.
PetSmart,1cbkq51b2as0me4o,4.0,Great and clean place. Staff is very friendly. I would fully recommend this as a good summer job or a great starting out job. you can work your way up very easily.

PetSmart,1cbkdkvtd5ncqfp8,4.0,"I loved working for the company, I have a passion for animals and for learning new things, and luckily my managers had given me all the tools and information I needed to become the best in my store. The company was decent moral wise, but there were a few changes that didn't make sense. There were many tasks to be done each day, but the animals and my coworkers made it all worth it."
PetSmart,1cbj7t7gvak4mc6c,4.0,"I enjoy the work I do at petsmart and take it as a great opportunity to teach people about animals and their proper care.Some days they expect a lot to get done in short amounts of time while also trying to assist customers. I do not like leaving things unfinished. Raises are very minimal, the discount could be better."
PetSmart,1cbiokrnkaqgk93e,4.0,"The best coworkers i've ever had were at petsmart. The work environment was relaxed but still productive, and people in all areas of the store were very helpful. I would absolutely recommend it and go back."
PetSmart,1cbih9id4akckcno,5.0,"I really enjoy working with people, especially animals. It was always fun and interesting seeing and meeting new faces and new pets enter our store. I never leave work dissatisfied!"
PetSmart,1cbhtfuhjakgkaj7,4.0,If you love working with people and animals of any kind it is a very rewarding job. You get to help both people and animals and it makes you feel like an overall better person. Although can be very stressful.
PetSmart,1cbh1ob9nbrctc74,3.0,"Wake up have to be at work at 4am, at my store we had to get started right away, we had the biggest store in the district, but the down fall to that was we only would have 4 hours to do our work just wasn't enough time to finish so we would get in trouble for unfinished work after shifts mind you we didn't take 15 minute breaks because literally every second mattered, management throws blame on you behind you're back to the store managers so they don't get in trouble for work not being completed but they fail to properly train and coach employees Management TERRIBLE but this is at the Lancaster Ca PetsMart, Most enjoyable part stay busy usually get out before customers come in so you wont get distracted customers are really kind, worst part the environment stressful,micromanaged,hostile blame gets thrown around behind your back...Co workers were really cool made the job that much better"
PetSmart,1cbglqqgcb85780r,5.0,I loved working here
PetSmart,1cbg7g0b8aqgk9h2,4.0,Would recommend to those who just turned 18 (for non-management positions) or those any age looking into management.  The location I worked at was only busy weekends (had 2 cashiers going all day) and got a little busy during the weekdays when people got off work (had 2 cashiers working on and off).  It's a really great job for those who love animals (mostly dogs & fish) or those who want a laid back job.
PetSmart,1cbg73u5bb88g96i,4.0,If you love animals I would recommend working there ! its a great place to not only earn but interact with the as well. doesn't give to many hours and they are always going through managers but its still a good job.
PetSmart,1cbg5os8bakckaa9,3.0,"I absolutely loved the people I worked with, easy to get along with. There was an unfair push to get people to sign  up for email coupons, and if we did not meet the quota we were put on probation."
PetSmart,1cbg5126nak8mf7a,5.0,"Loved job,loved the people, love animals & the managers were willing to work/help you.Very appreciative of them hiring & never giving up on me. Thank you for helping me boost my customer service skills."
PetSmart,1cbfk67q3akck9uo,4.0,"I wouldn't go any further than a part time position. I am an animal lover and I think thats the sole reason as to why I'm still there, besides making extra money. It's not that great, but I guess its what you make of It."
PetSmart,1cbfhl2o1b810f0v,3.0,"It was interesting to work here, as I was constantly passed up for advancement from bather to groomer. There isnt' much more to say about it, really..."
PetSmart,1cbfajfrqak4meq0,5.0,"There is opportunity to learn as much or as little as you would like to within the company.  You can read manuals, shadow others, or just attend meetings to listen to what goes on in areas where you want to learn more, and they welcome your questions and feedback.  Can share ideas across the network and with corporate as well, though this is usually only if someone takes the initiative, so it may be better to have more scheduled, routine meetings to push this collaboration.  It's a quick-paced environment, but they do their best to keep everyone happy with relaxed dress code, fun events, free food, and the ability to being your pet to work!  The company overall does good work for charities as well.  Nice to be proud of where you work."
PetSmart,1cbfa81qaakckd9g,3.0,If you love working with animals this is the place for you. A typical day at work started with checking all the animals and making sure that they were all alive and healthy. If they were sickly they were taken out of rotation until we could get them healthy. Of course you fed them and cleaned their cages or aquariums as well. We also had the privilege of finding each of our animals a home. Management expected you to work hard and would teach and correct you when you made a mistake. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job was to see the animals you had grown attached to go to their new homes.
PetSmart,1cbe8patnb80saem,3.0,The only upside is being able to be around animals all the time. The management doesn't really seem to care for the employee's very much. But some of the people that work there are great.
PetSmart,1cbe0p67haqgiddo,5.0,Very faced paced and high demand. As long as you don't have a family great place to work for. Weekends and holidays are required so be ready to give those up.
PetSmart,1cbdmhiugbrcq966,4.0,Work is pretty straight forward. It is a good place if you are willing to come in and get to work. If seeking advancement this is not the place for you.
PetSmart,1cbdmg3m0ak8kc8p,4.0,Since the first day I started working at Petsmart I enjoyed working there. My coworkers made me feel welcome and a lot of customers became really close friend almost family members in my eyes. I've learned a lot of basic care and some experienced things about multiple types of animals. Management has shown me a glimpse of what it's like to be manager and to deescalate bad situations with customers.
PetSmart,1cbctfa0bas0kd5b,3.0,PetSmart was a great company though it did start to decline once they sold their shares to a private market.  Management was not that impressive but the DMs were great.

PetSmart,1cbcrmja5ak4kaft,3.0,I would come in around 5am Friday Saturday and Sunday and stay for 12 hours. Make sure you eat cause this is defiantly a job you can easily work up an appetite
PetSmart,1cbcqv6hiakcia7o,4.0,"the grooming salon is a stressful and tightly packed place with too many people in it. the job itself is great, and the people are cool, but the hours given even being close to full time are still not enough to pay rent."
PetSmart,1cbcib2t15nco9v7,4.0,Loved the job and all the animals I got to encounter on a daily basis. Really built connections with other employees and grew to love the animals taken care of.
PetSmart,1cbbvhtpkb854abe,4.0,"If you’re a college student, have a second job, or just looking for part time work, Petsmart is a great company to work with. Advancement is possible with time and hard work, but it’s a lot of stress when you have to deal with constant down pour of neediness from higher ups. Animals are always fun working with, staff (other than some management) are almost always really good people, and the job is pretty fun when it comes to doing the actual job. But policies and standards are constantly changing turning simple tasks into unnecessarily hard projects."
PetSmart,1cbaprn4n1d131a9,2.0,"Not a great work environment. Lots of gossip, including management gossiping about employees and other managers. Situations that should have been taken serious were not, situations that were taken serious should not have. Higher ups could not connect with employees due to no actual knowledge of Grooming or pet sales."
PetSmart,1cbaeibvfak4kedi,1.0,I worked for petsmart for almost 7 years and in total only got about 50 cents in raises as they are solely based on your managers decision. The pay is not great and overtime was mostly mandatory unless you had a really good reason to need to leave.
PetSmart,1cb8qlegrak8jdtl,4.0,working at Petsmart was fun getting to see all kinds of animals was great. unless you plan to work there all your life it's a job for a college student or a teen looking for some extra cash not really a career.
PetSmart,1cb8pj7b6brcob47,5.0,PetSmart is a great place to work alongside others. There are many opportunity's to grow and advance. Its a fun and friendly environment filled with plenty adorable animals.
PetSmart,1cb8p59nrakchb88,5.0,It was a very good job because of the management and people who worked there. They started making it harder to make rate which is where I started to look for another job.
PetSmart,1cb7lc2b4akghd9p,3.0,"I learn appointment scheduling ,grooming assistant techniques ,peoples skill and most of my customer skills here. i had to up-sale products or services to try to meet the clients best interest."
PetSmart,1cb7fnkjm5j4jfrj,3.0,"They work you hard, and expect you to help customers constantly. But half the time customers only ask things that you don't know (things a vet or manager would). And they don't train you to be able to answer those questions. It would be a much nicer job if they just let you stock shelves without having to worry about being ambushed with nutritional questions that you aren't qualified to answer."
PetSmart,1cb7enie65ncnbl3,5.0,One of the best job I could ever work at. Environment is fun. Costumer service is the best. Staff is definitely a family. In evaluation you can get raise
PetSmart,1cb3tl4k3b85292n,4.0,PetSmart is an extremely fun place to work at. I had the best time working there with different types of animals all the time. Only thing that I didn't like is how we would share a break room with the places next door.
PetSmart,1cb1furbnak8jeh3,4.0,"For Cashier: Be sure to always be forward with approaching customers. Always try to sell Guides to customers, this will allow you to work more hours."
PetSmart,1cb054c76ak8jeie,5.0,"Was able to learn so much from this job, very friendly company and good Management was able to meet friendly people and lean to care for pets as a pet owner"
PetSmart,1cavpecfgaqgh9ua,2.0,Management time was not very good.  Many problems throughout the time I worked there.  They always tried to just hide problems instead of trying to fix them.
PetSmart,1cavia357ak4jf9u,3.0,"The salon is notorious for being super stressful. The money is good of you work hard, but management makes life miserable. The management is so concerned with pleasing the clients that they spit all over the groomers and force them to do tasks that aren't safe. They are more focused on the amount of dogs groomed rather than the actual quality which upsets the groomer who take pride in their work. There was a previous salon manager that went out if her way to try and fire people for no reason."
PetSmart,1caufrbqbb896b8n,3.0,"Since they went with new owners, constantly changing what they expect. Everyone afraid of losing their job. Everyone out for themselves,  little to no teambuilding."

PetSmart,1catt9b38ak8jcj6,4.0,Always moving it was a good fast working place to work. Good people and always someome was around to help if you needed the help .Over time was giving everyonce in a while
PetSmart,1catpmkem52sn8i1,1.0,Would not like to go into detail. Store manager where I worked was extremely rude. I was not paid enough to deal with what I had to. Wasn't worth it to me to stay there.
PetSmart,1cat82g6uaqghc0m,2.0,"It's a good place to learn how to groom, but not great for the long term. The corporation setting isn't a fantastic place to groom and you can get fired over the littlest thing"
PetSmart,1cas7m1gobrclctr,2.0,If your an experience groomer the money is not worth it. Too stressful. Expectations are high but not willing to pay you enough. Do not enroll in training with them
PetSmart,1caru2lvi1aie41k,3.0,"work was the same every day. I bath dogs did there nails  showed member servies. chashier, clean up after my self. helped others with there dog. clean the salon"
PetSmart,1caratalv1bgf4ia,3.0,"It is a pretty typical retail job with added responsibilities and benefits that come with working with animals and animal lovers. If you are a hard-working person looking for retail employment that loves animals, consider working for PetSmart."
PetSmart,1caqtltsh1ahu61p,4.0,"Its alright, but its a low base pay for the grooming salon for the amount of work you do. We also have miscellaneous rules that sometimes aren't necessary but that is the corporate life for you. Besides being a bather, you can move up to being a groomer, and possibly a grooming manager. However its all about grooming dogs so you have to truly be set in what you want to do. Once they send you to the advancement classes, you are locked into a contract for 2+ years. If you quit or get fired, you would owe them legally 10,000 dollars."
PetSmart,1caqf4eu45j4ga25,5.0,I highly enjoyed working here. The only reason I left was because I got pregnant and working two jobs is tough. The managers and the people were great to work with.
PetSmart,1caqcesr95j4gaap,3.0,They don't offer many work hours. Not enough to balance life or make ends meet. The most I've worked was 13 hours a week. The least was 3 hours. The new employers never get a chance.
PetSmart,1capmpsheb84vdgp,2.0,"In my store, we had 4 managers. The primary manager (i'll call her N) was a cold, heartless woman. Rarely smiled, never gave praise, but quick to anger and lash out. She also would be more than happy to fire someone for absolutely no reason if she felt as if she was being questioned in anyway."
PetSmart,1capgafceb80ndgh,5.0,"Working at Petsmart was a pleasure. The company is going down hill, which is why I left. They would not work with my college schedule once I started school."
PetSmart,1capb2b8a1ahu2an,4.0,"Overall it was a great workplace. My only problem was I didn’t receive enough hours. I loved everyone I worked with, it was a positive environment and it’s a great place to work."
PetSmart,1caoijlim1bgf30d,3.0,"Pet Smart takes  a lot of inspiration from our pets. Their companionship, intelligence and energy are what motivate us to bring the best of ourselves to work each day.

PetSmart,1caod9kudb84va5b,2.0,"Loved working with the animals, but management wouldn't allow any more than 28 hours a week. And I was making maybe 8.50 an hour. They refused to give any extra hours or promote anyone so they could support themselves and their families. The favoritism was ridiculous, and the management was always complaining about never having coverage, yet couldn't offer overtime."
PetSmart,1cao9jsurb893fdf,3.0,"Each day is different, meeting new and exciting people and grooming a wide variety of dogs and cats. We all work as a team to accomplish multiple tasks."

You come in and are also in charge of training and coaching all cashiers as well as running the petcare department and its group. It gets overwhelming but when there are no issues it can be easy. When your fish system crashes, the parts are unavailable, your cashiers aren't meeting set goals, you have more animal stock than you can safely handle and you are covering the floor alone... it is stressful."
PetSmart,1calot3s31ba552t,1.0,Working at PetSmart was very stressful and there was a lack of advancement opportunities. I work there for year and constantly asked about being promoted to groomer and instead of telling me no I just got a lot of running around. They didn't offer me a lot of hours however other people came in and got the hours that I asked for. The company was not straightforward and they cost me a lot time and effort and I got nowhere in a year.
PetSmart,1calhr3jm1ahi2cm,3.0,"At PetSmart, you are always learning something new. This continues cultivating you and makes your job position still interesting and exciting. I was promoted to different job titles which was rewarding and I'm very appreciative of my management team for acknowledging my work ethic and granting me the opportunities."

I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1caklk9pr1agr3kg,2.0,"This job started out great then the company went private and they started having unreasonable expectations such as counting every customer, including children, and expecting you to turn them all into paying customers."
PetSmart,1cakch937brci94d,5.0,I loved my time at petsmart everybody did there job and everybody was responsible and respectful and got there duties done that they had it was a mellow place to work at manager treated everybody with respect

PetSmart,1caf9hb3d1ba75t4,5.0,"As a stylist apprentice, I work hands on with dogs. Grooming requires lots of patients as some dogs can get aggressive. It can definitely get stressful being surrounded by a lot of dogs but it is the most fun job to work in."
PetSmart,1caeogkulak4ke0d,3.0,Shifts are usually about 5 hours for part-time. Pay and the hours were decent for the job. Managers are inconsiderate of employees and push petperks too much.
PetSmart,1caec68t2ak91c2d,5.0,"fun place for animal lovers to work, fast paced, and the hardest part of the job was the difficult customers but the best part was the team i had around me helping me. Management is incredible and always there willing to work with you in whatever you need."
PetSmart,1cae75tb25n8idrb,1.0,"Working at Petsmart was easily the worst job I've ever had. I had to care for sick and dying animals, and management was more worried about the company's bottom dollar than actually caring for the creatures they were supposed to sell."
PetSmart,1cac3rqgu1ahi0vq,2.0,"I had a fun time working there at first, but after about 8 months, a lot of changes were being made and I didn't agree with a lot of them. Now PetSmart doesn't stand for what it used to."
PetSmart,1cabineb3b80ke30,1.0,"Stressful work environment. They tried to push so many dogs on the bathers, and once you finally finished all your scheduled dogs the manager at the time would make us wash the groomers dogs for them (without compensating us). Also the manager at the time would try and get me to take dogs without updated rabies information. Absolutely not..."
PetSmart,1cababg85ak91fde,5.0,"PetSmart was a wonderful place to work that I really enjoyed.

PetSmart,1ca9btvjj1ba329h,3.0,"the mangers are very forth coming with what they would like to see, sometimes expectations are not reality. Many times you will not be recognized for all of the extra things you have done or how you have helped others."
PetSmart,1ca92l6110mte0th,4.0,"Though working in the store with staff was an enjoyable experience, there is a lot of scrutiny from the district management level and sometimes overwhelming corporate expectations. There was no consistency from store to store."
PetSmart,1ca8rqueuakfvcj9,5.0,"I enjoyed my time working for PetSmart. Nothing wrong with the job specifically, or the type of people that you usually work with. However after the company sold the new owners started going through and changing a lot of policies and procedures that did not need to be changed. Causing a lot of the work to become unnecessarily stressful and frustrating."
PetSmart,1ca8nkh1r0mcl695,5.0,Well organized and well run. I was encouraged to learn new things on the job constantly; a promotion of some kind was definitely in the future. Managers were incredibly knowledgeable about different kinds of pets. It was wonderful to be surrounded by people who really cared about animals.

PetSmart,1ca7n93jhb88sbf4,2.0,"Petsmart was fun at first but the job is very repetitive. Many times all the managers cared about was Sales, conversion, and  not so much the health of the animals. Associates were often times tasked with managerial tasks.  Managers typically only saw the issues with the department and never the success."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1ca6tpiq3ak4hfvs,3.0,A typical day would begin at 5 am and start with checking e-mailto see if there was anything that corporate wanted us to do right away. Then it would be to have a morning huddle to go over the expectations for the day with any team members that might be there. After setting the expectations for the morning it is time for the the morning paper work and getting the store ready to open. Other departments start coming in and I have to make sure they are on task as well.
PetSmart,1ca6bel3f0mtu2j9,1.0,"They have VERY POOR management, you are under paid, mistreated, talked about, put down in front of customers. There is more drama at this salon than 15 high schools combined. It is not worth it at all to work here. Worse job experience ever...other than the dogs."
PetSmart,1ca68nludak8ua60,3.0,"I really like the management and people that I worked with, although the evening shift was difficult. A lot of stocking and restocking and sealing with new/old customers who had relationships with workers- which allowed them to get unallowed discounts"
PetSmart,1ca57l3n7b88rb61,3.0,"Overall the only thing I appreciate from Petsmart is me going to grooming school and getting paid to learn a skill. Other that that management sucks, but it does all depend on store and team of course"
PetSmart,1ca4silrsb88q99e,5.0,"I don't want to write anything about this job, I don't want to give my opinion, it was an okay place to work, and this was a great place if you needed a first job and what not."
PetSmart,1ca4s7d5sak8r8gt,4.0,I would of stayed with the company if i was at a different location and that they were more flexible with peoples lifestyles and availability. They need to work harder at making sure everybody has the chance to work the schedule that was best for them. The location i was at only cared about the people that have been there a long time and gave them special privileges.
PetSmart,1ca49ms28akjv9ha,4.0,"Pet Smart offered a great experience, in that I was provided with a fantastic two week training period, the guidance of previous professionals, and continuous on the job training."

PetSmart,1ca3qgsjb1agt02s,4.0,The only reason I wont quit this job is simply my love for the animals. I would do anything for animals in need. The Job itself is INCREDIBLY TOUGH. Its something that must be completely thought out if you wish to join the salon  work force.
PetSmart,1ca3f8pru1agt5d4,4.0,"It's a good job. Hours are fine, and the enviroment is great. I worked in petcare, so my day was spent cleaning aquariums, and helping customer get the suppiles and correct information about their pets."
PetSmart,1ca3ehshpaqjvad6,4.0,the most enjoyable part is connecting with animals and the customers that love their pets. Although sales for premium packages are very important to them.
PetSmart,1ca3cpra8akfs961,4.0,Stocked inventory and ran thecregister. For me the register was difficult with face to face customer interactions.  My coworkers were great and the managers were very helpful & nice.
PetSmart,1ca1pqufpakfsdjm,4.0,"Cashier was easy and hard depending on the time of day or year (holidays). Learning the basics was easy once you do it enough. Managers were great and helpful, hard to get full time or get pay increase."
PetSmart,1ca1n21061d0a62k,5.0,"Not terrible. Simple job, fun work days. Management could use work. Favoritism is showed. Flexible schedules. Will work with you on hours and days off."
PetSmart,1ca1f40pp0mcl282,3.0,"To cut off costs and lift the company income hours are being reduced for the employees.  This concludes in one person completing a job that's supposed to be made by 3.  The environment and clients are the most enjoyable part of the job but, management is lacking most of the time.  When you ask for back up or help the delay is too much for the clients that leave extremely upset.  The hours are flexible but consider that the less availability you have the less hours you will get."
PetSmart,1ca197o8g0mtm16f,1.0,Worst five weeks of my life. The minute the new manager walked in the door so negative I knew it was going to be bad. I put my resignation in at five weeks of him taking over that pet smart.
PetSmart,1c9vo8vao0mcl730,2.0,"I worked at petsmart for a year, where they threw me in the salon without knowing a thing and then punished me for not knowing anything by cutting my hours and not booking me clients for three months.I was just a maid service."
PetSmart,1c9v1mm0u1fdn3a2,3.0,"I was extremely happy with my first 5 years with the company. I was able to advance from bather, to groomer, and than salon manager. The company truly cared about animals and the happiness of its employees. however after it was sold the new company made drastic staffing cutbacks and it lowered its standards for animals care and customer service. The employees tried extremely hard to meet these changes however it's nearly impossible when the hours are cut and understaffing happened, The online booking system and it's misbooking was what finally made me leave the company. I put safety over profit. I also want to provide the best arrive to the customer."
PetSmart,1c9spqb3g1fdn26f,3.0,"I looked forward to go to work. All dogs should pass a handling test but some bad dogs will pass through due to apathetic management. co-workers WERE great until a ""no fun allowed"" policy was enforced. People who SHOULDNT be leaders end up in the leadership position likely because of brown-nosing. Make sure you set boundaries for yourself even if it is a first or second job. ex: dont let them give you roller coaster schedules especially if it is a part time job. YOU have to keep the upper heads ACCOUNTABLE because not only is your safety in question, but also the safety of other pets."
PetSmart,1c9r243omb88ndvb,4.0,"Going in with no previous work experience at all, this company has done its best to train me to the fullest extent for my position. This is the busiest location in the city of Las Vegas, and an average day the store is usually packed! The best part of the job for me was greeting all of the cute pets and helping pet parents find just what they needed for their little friend. The hardest part was dealing with theft. The company policies regarding it are very basic.. If a known thief making a bad return made enough of a ruckus, depending on the managers on duty, would get away with it almost every time. If you're not the type to mind things like this, it's a very easy and low stress job!"

PetSmart,1c9qbnigq1agt11m,3.0,"This is a great place to work for if you have a love for animals, or if you're a student that just needs a job and something to take the stress off of you. Can be relaxed at times, busy and fast paced the next."
PetSmart,1c9q8pb44akfs9d6,4.0,It was all about the animals and the satisfaction of having all shelves full of product and hearing the customers awknowledge and reward you. Thus maxing out your quartly bonuses! I would always reward my staff members (3) $100.00 Every 4 months. I really enjoyed working there. You would make many animal friends as well has your customers that would come in daily and chat with you.
PetSmart,1c9q798ueb84m96k,4.0,Customers will wear you down. It's fun working there when you're able to help people and keep a positive attitude. It helps to have a manager with the same outlook and goals.

PetSmart,1c9pn79mvb88nau8,5.0,"Simple job, good for students who need to make a few extra bucks. Working at the Pets-hotel means interaction with dogs and cats on a daily basis. You are entrusted to care for dogs and cats who are deeply loved by their own owners."
PetSmart,1c9p7inqf1d0a6gg,1.0,"management and district leaders are not supportive, they are one sided, always changing rules and policies, company is now all about the money with the new owners when it used to be about the pets and saving lives."
PetSmart,1c9p5v9ou0mtv40u,4.0,Persmart is a great job to start it especially if you love animals when I first started there I wasn’t really a animal lover but I started to love them they are way better then working with humans at times!

PetSmart,1c9ks92he5j7nd8g,5.0,"As a support manager I trained and educated all new hires on cashier skills and current employees on new policy.

PetSmart,1c9ks10lsak8obe7,5.0,"Petsmart was a great place to work because I got to work with dogs and their owners. Although Petsmart managers sometimes don't have the time for groomers in the salon, they were helpful and supportive when we needed them. The people are what really made the job pleasurable. My coworkers and I had fun times working together. I also found it rewarding to groom these dogs and interact with their owners. Petsmart was able to make the job exciting and fulfilling while still maintaining a professional environment."
PetSmart,1c9k75n800mtr6s9,4.0,"Employees were really nice, customer's were friendly at times, I learned that the customer is always right, I liked my managers, The hardest part working there was the hours"
PetSmart,1c9jnkd4f5j7n96h,3.0,Too corpritsized! Did not care about the employees as long as quota was met and stock was placed on the shelves. All Dogs must be groomed and you must be clocked in and out according to time clock times set by corporate which made it very hard to do your work. Very hard work environment! Cared more about paper work then pets!
PetSmart,1c9ivehu6akfp8ce,2.0,"The management has very bad communication with associates. The new policies are very unclear. One supervisor will ignore policies, and another will try to get you fired. a lot of favoritism."
PetSmart,1c9il7p2u0kbq1qi,4.0,everymorning there is a morning hundle. being a cashier you get slammed all the time for email captures. they are understanding of personal situations.
PetSmart,1c9ih4isdak8off8,3.0,This job is stressful and not for those easily overwhelmed on weekends and holidays. During the week it dies down and is generally relaxed and easy days throughout the week.

PetSmart,1c99pjcl61fdn7je,1.0,Not everyone puts in equal effort. I voice my opinion on things and it just gets tossed aside. The store manager is a good manager but not a good leader. He talks bad about employees behind there back or sometimes to their face. You’re job description is a lot more than what you apply for. I do have pros and cons for all managers so it’s not all negative just mostly negative.
PetSmart,1c99nrbcv0mtr493,4.0,"Even though for the little pay that borders minimum wage, raises were frequent, benefits stable for employees full-time, hours stable for those in night shift. Work environment was always exciting and management always fair and supportive of their employees."

PetSmart,1c982k2hd0kbp0lh,3.0,The customers and the team members were great with fairly good managers very poor structure and inability to really take control of any situation on your own lack of competitive pay and very stagnant movement as far as growth and opportunity to move up.
PetSmart,1c97njkf31ago2j8,4.0,"As a bather, you can possibly get pulled from your job to do quick services. This can be difficult, especially if you are behind. The dogs were the best part but not every dog is the same. The people working there were wonderful. The stress and unpredictability of each dog can be a little trying but otherwise it's a great job. The end goal is to be a groomer."
PetSmart,1c97kg3l0ak8na6b,2.0,"I left because I was picked on by upper management. I was overloaded with work and when I would ask for help, I would not receive any. Rather, they would put people in other places rather than where the help was really needed. New employees where making the same amount of money I was making when I left after over 5 years of dedication to the company. Raises where never more than 10 cents."
PetSmart,1c97farvkakjoaum,4.0,It was a great experience other than a lack of training and poor management as far as my store lead. It is definitely a great company with great morals

PetSmart,1c95chrp9akfkanb,4.0,"As an early morning stocker, I started work at about 0530 and got off at 1300. The work was not easy as you are required to for half of your day lift bags of dog food which can weigh up to 100lbs, so I hope you’re swol and know how to properly lift with your legs. It can be incredibly tedious and tiring. You will be engaged by customers who are either looking for something but haven’t actually tried looking or people with questions only management or a Veterinarian would know."
PetSmart,1c95btb9iakfk9cf,5.0,Now I am an opener so I come in open the floor. Which consist of making sure all the pets have fresh food and a clean habitat. Bag Crickets for customers and feed fish. Take care of any sick animals. I do deep clean so I have to do more work than most associates. (This is the short version.) Managers are ok some are better than others. T.
PetSmart,1c954sfojb80ieop,1.0,"I did enjoy this just because of the dogs, but management would not cooperate with school schedule, supervisor was too busy flirting instead of helping the employees, it was very stressful, communication was horrible."
PetSmart,1c950t49c1ah9082,4.0,"PetSmart was a challenging company to work for because the pressure of selling pet training classes sometimes overshadowed your customer service scores and sales.

PetSmart,1c95087lj1ah92mn,5.0,"I adored my job at Petsmart. My days usually including harcuts on 6 or more dogs. I enjoyed interacting with customers and pets. The workplace had a very high stress-level. The hardest part of the job was the stress and the amount of scrutiny we were under by the company. My manager was decent. She was very high strung. All in all, I learned to trust my instincts. I learned that doing a good job, and being on task without bringing personal things to work would be most beneficial."
PetSmart,1c93llked5nbub9f,5.0,Petsmart allowed me the opportunity to work one on one with individual and their pets. I was able to understand  the pets needs and it allowed me to build a relationship with the pet parent. Very satisfying and rewarding career.
PetSmart,1c93e8oc51agm6o4,4.0,Petsmart is an overall great company to work for. Job can be stressful at times when working with animals. Work environment was friendly and safe. Loved working and helping animals and customers everyday.
PetSmart,1c933e9aab80i80d,1.0,i have never worked for a company that was so poorly run. the management is disappointing due to the fact that the focus mostly on there own means and no one elses
PetSmart,1c92jvq5t0kbi0m7,4.0,"The environment is typically breakneck pace or dead. The store is understaffed, so there is always something to do, but at peak customer volume, there is very little to do by way of customer satisfaction."
PetSmart,1c92d154c1d153eg,3.0,"Poor leadership and constant change has left the company in constant flux. There is a lack of work-life balance negative morale with high turnover and layoffs.  PetSmart has lost a lot of great talent and has no training/growth initiatives for internal associates.  Company lacks long range vision and strategic footing creating an environment with lots of re-work and rides on consistent poor execution. Company needs a CEO and management team that will offer structure, vision and speak to the mission of the company.  There are a lot of amazing people that are very passionate about this company which makes it a supportive environment within the local teams."
PetSmart,1c92crggg1d0s3dg,3.0,"A typical workday was stressful. I got a bite from a dog everyday. The worst part was management would do nothing about it. I developed tendinitis from my job and pet smart doesn't cover that. They told me that since it wasn't a sudden injury like a break of bite wound, they were in no way to blame."
PetSmart,1c92crb6sakjkbk1,3.0,The best part of this job is that you get to work with animals. It is a very productive and quick paced job. Time management skills are very important. I have learned a lot from this job in both the behavioral and technical sense.
PetSmart,1c92bs6rvakfkf3j,3.0,Be patient patient so you can get the job done at a reasonable time. You can get very stressful but just take a break when you start feeling overwhelmed. You can have fun at the job especially working with animals and you can build great customer relationships. You learn more things about animals then you probably didn’t know before. And watching the dogs play at the hotel is also great.
PetSmart,1c90dfigrakjkbi3,3.0,"Good place for college students to learn retail. Pay / salary is not good for the amount of work required. No real benefits. High turnover, the manager over all of the Austin district was not fair or nice."
PetSmart,1c90d6ubraqjna8m,4.0,"getting computers booted and kennels ready for dogs being brought in, starting first baths or answering phones, interweaving nail trims and grinds between baths and taking more appointments. cleaning at the end of the day. hardest part is managing the heavy influx of clips/grinds sometimes and the most enjoyable is seeing an animal nice and clean after. workplace and management generally lax but sometimes they push for more when you know an animal is too stressed."
PetSmart,1c9039cnib80i8v7,4.0,"Usually my day starts out at working by coming though the door and being over loaded with information that i never have enough time to understand or even remember, usually it mellows out towards the end of the day. The customers and families that come in are absolutely wonderful! As an employee you gain so many wonderful relationships with the customers and since I work at a micro store the customers always remember you, and sometimes they will remember your name! I would say the hardest part of my job was listening to my manager vent her anger to me. This happened A LOT! For some reason I always felt like it was my fault by the attitude and tone she was using with me."
PetSmart,1c901agng5j7if74,2.0,Volunteeing at shady grove helped me love cats. Initially i was terrifieed but i grew a fodness of them. It also helped me help the homeless and provide as much as i could for them.
PetSmart,1c8vepqe95nfrasp,3.0,"If you barely want to be making minimum wage and working your butt off this job is for you. You get a barely nothing percent off, 15%. If you are ever promised a higher up position get it in writing or you could be screwed over like I was. They cut hours a lot, so if you're a college student wanting to make more in the summers thats just not gonna happen. You work your butt off here and there is no compensation for it. You won't get a pay raise after a year either. The pets are great and so are my coworkers but the manual labor isn't worth it."
PetSmart,1c8trkalm1d0s5v1,4.0,"Loved working with animals, but working with people made this job so difficult. Customers wouldn't listen and apply proper care, which often resulted in returning a dead animal. We also got a lot of sick animals from the breeders which often died. We didn't have the right equipment or knowledge to cure these animals. Management often forgot to make a vet appointment for them. The environment was very unprofessional."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1c8tp50di5j7ia5b,1.0,The new manager at the Walpole location is not someone who works well with a team of individuals. There are plenty of locations in the area. I would consider another location before ever going to work for that woman. It's a toxic culture growing inside of the Walpole store. Along side the meal moths and maggots living in the pet food.
PetSmart,1c8toj5td1d0s6pu,4.0,"As a cashier, the atmosphere is usually slow-paced. There's a multitude of things to do, but none really are very demanding or difficult. Must love animals, as in, must be okay cleaning up after animals. Also must be okay with dealing with dead animals, but in a limited manner. A solid 4/5 stars. Better than food."
PetSmart,1c8tialjt5j7ifdj,3.0,"My hours were mediocre in had to work 4 am to 1 pm 3-5 days a week, the people I worked with made the jkob tolerable nothing else get a feel for who is around you if you take this job on."
PetSmart,1c8rhu4ptakfkftm,1.0,"Management lacked compassion for pets and customers and employees. They hired the laziest of workers. Overworked, and underappreciated. Management in the Petshotel wouldn't even manage! They would sit in their office and ""work"" while everyone else was running all over trying to get things done in time."
PetSmart,1c8rg7mglakfkdgr,4.0,the pay was fair based on my experience as an employee just coming into the company. They gave me a few opportunities to advance into the company and the management was pretty great
PetSmart,1c8r11j0v0kbi678,3.0,"Salon manager only cares about sales and not about strain on employees. Salon manager not focused on helping others, and only helps herself. Salon manager is also very demeaning."
PetSmart,1c8r046k9akjjb87,3.0,Offer very poor pay for my area Mcdonalds hires for more. Can't keep employees so the ones they have are overworked constantly trying to call people in.
PetSmart,1c8p2jf6cakfkdih,5.0,I loved working at petsmart and it really sparked my love for pets to an even higher level. The only problem I had was with my co-workers in the grooming salon. The girls in there were very cut-throat and did a very poor job training. After my training they insulted me often and blamed it on me as to why I didn't know many things I was suppose to. I love constructive criticism however I didn't feel like this was very constructive. I loved all other aspects of working in the petsmart community!
PetSmart,1c8ot3jlc5nfrbim,4.0,"As much as I enjoyed working at PetSmart, I also am aware of flaws that were very much evident. Granted, the store I worked for was a new store, and traffic on Hilton Head does not pick up until the summer, but most days off-season are slow. This may be subject to change as years tread on, given that the immediate area is still undergoing construction. I did enjoy helping people find what they needed, and seeing that I checked them out quickly at the front. I suppose I would recommend this Job to someone who wants a slow paced workplace."
PetSmart,1c8ntt2kq1ah96ch,5.0,"Why I have to write something????????????????????????????Just don’t make friends here. Stay to ur self , do ur job and go home because  it’s not worth it."
PetSmart,1c8nrlin31d0s1dt,5.0,I loved working there sooo much . It is probably my favorite job I've had as a young adult . The atmosphere is so warm and happy . There is always something to learn. I learned sooo much working here.
PetSmart,1c8mhk09uakjjacv,4.0,I liked working for petsmart. my last year there was in the hotel and I got burnt out quickly. I have 3 small children and balancing work and home was difficult because of the requirements for shifts. But I liked my managers and the company. and I had to drive 40 minutes one way everyday for 6 years.
PetSmart,1c8mfd2isb80ido3,4.0,"Great place to work if you love animals. Always opportunities to cross train in a variety of positions. Genuine people, positive attitudes and great motto."
PetSmart,1c8m8u04e0kbi0gb,3.0,Very great place that makes you feel welcome. Very competitive so a lot is expected from employees. Does not have very flexible schedules or hours. Does offer a great amount of room to move up in your career.
PetSmart,1c8m2q7nvaqjnejl,5.0,"I loved working at Petsmart. There are two things you need to work here. One, be friendly and customer service oriented. Two, a love for animals! The job itself is fun and always different!"
PetSmart,1c8lrnk4dakjjcn9,2.0,"Worked long hours with 4am start time. Physically demanding and long hours and weekends. Pay is normal for retail, but the work is more demanding than the average retail."
PetSmart,1c8l9t4suakjjd35,3.0,Working at petsmart is fun because of the dogs. managment on the other hand is not great. they dont seem to care about their employees. and make them feel bad for being sick and having to miss work.
PetSmart,1c8l7v63b1ah92ph,5.0,"Things can get very busy and stressful sometimes. However, the team tends to stick together and help each other through any hard times. Most employees are dedicated and caring. Best manager I have ever had. Customers are usually very sweet."
PetSmart,1c8go4bdbakfhd24,3.0,Consistantley ran out of required tools to complete the task at hand. Assigned too many clients to complete within work hours; managment was non existent.
PetSmart,1c8g9nmkaakfh84q,4.0,PetSmart is a very good place to work. But if you are looking for something with steady hours it's not the best option. This is a really good job if your looking for part time but of you need full time some PetSmarts lack the overall hours to give you full time. And there's not much chance of  being promoted.

PetSmart,1c8g6s8pk5nbqcdc,4.0,a very busy and  upbeat salon with great people to work with. always something to do weather it be services on the grooming animals or helping pet parents with purchases or just providing them with information for purchases
PetSmart,1c8g4crhrakfhbvs,5.0,PetSmart was a part-time job and temporary. The work environment was good and the people were very kind and understanding. The supervisor/ manager was very educated and what she was doing and very understanding when it came to our employees
PetSmart,1c8fvfpc3aqjkdg8,3.0,It was relaxing at first because i started off as a bather. Then when i became a groomer it got a little harder. But i have come a long way from that now. The hardest part of the job was transitioning from bather to groomer. The most enjoyable part of the job was some of the people i worked with help me get thru the transitioning.
PetSmart,1c8ekbbicak7pfts,2.0,I loved the animals and that’s really the only reason I stayed as long as I did. The store rarely had managers for more than a year or two and the floor managers never lasted long. Moving up is only available to the pretty brown nosers and standing up to a manager when they have caused the death of an animal is not respected. Blackmail is a common practice.
PetSmart,1c8efn7sl1ah05mi,5.0,"I really enjoy working at petsmart. Every one that works there does a little bit of everything in which we all help one another out and try our best to support everyone. I really enjoy that i get to work in close quarters with animals and also their owners because you get to meet different personalities and also you get to see just how owners get to interact with their pet and they like to teach you new things as well. Most of the time you get to stay pretty busy at the store with helping clean, stock shelves, help a customer, or care for the animals we sell."
PetSmart,1c8e9lav95nbmdss,4.0,"As the Pet Care Manager/Customer Engagment Leader, a typical day at PetSmart included checking store metrics to see where our opportunities for improvement were and what associates needed to be recognized for improvements or customer recognition. I've learned how to listen to customers and resolve any issues they may have had, as well as learning that although my title gave me authority, I am no higher of a person than my associates and that we are all one team working together. I personally feel that the management in my particular store could have had better communication in different aspects of the store. Our workplace culture was a fun, hands on type of place. Who couldn't be happy at work when a cute puppy comes running in the door? The hardest part of the job for me personally is the lack of communication in a few important areas of the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was not only seeing the pet parents and their animals, but building the relationships with them and gaining their loyalty and trust."
PetSmart,1c8e9eild5nfiei2,3.0,"The job pay is sad, health care, what is that lol, only thing I like is working with the adorable pets. The people at the job are so cutthroat its crazy!....."
PetSmart,1c8e1oe5k52vofc1,4.0,Fun place to work with a good team. Great management team willing to work along side you. Enjoyed the variety of animals and people that came in on a daily basis.
PetSmart,1c8e1324takfdblp,5.0,Working for this company I loved it at the start but I also was a assigned a manager job that the last manager left the store a mess for four months that I had to pick up and complete in such a short time. The hours that were scheduled for my employees made it hard for me to have them work on projects. It had made it impossible to complete our jobs on time which came down to just me being the only worker in the store for a few hours before I had to open it.
PetSmart,1c8dtb2tcak7pa72,3.0,"While I respect my old managers as people, I have a harder time respecting the store. I do whole heartedly believe the company takes precautions and cares for their animals immensely. They are well taken care of and there is no neglect. Other pet stores don’t take as good of care, from my experience. If you can handle the hours, the fast paced environment, and the pressure to meet the demands of the store, then it’s a great place to work. Due to personal experience I ended up leaving. Not a bad place to get your foot in the door, though."
PetSmart,1c8c09ppvakjcb4i,4.0,job is steady and having policies in place is great - not very flexible with work schedules. When i was working there it was usually that grooming staff only were allowed one weekend day a month off which was not realistic.
PetSmart,1c8bt1e0eakfdaa3,3.0,"My manager is awesome, but my coworkers never want to work and it causes a lot of issues with scheduling and can make work more stressful. There is more to the job than playing with puppies, but it is still fun."
PetSmart,1c8b88rbpakfdcel,5.0,I loved learning about grooming dogs and all the different processes that in order to get the perfect groom. The problem was only a certian amount of hours they had to split between bathers resulting in me only getting 10 hours a week.
PetSmart,1c8b6idl61ah07on,5.0,"Loved grooming and teaching people to groom. Loved managing the shop and building the business. Lack of computer system for record keeping and someone dedicated to answering the phone and interacting with clients made job very stressful. Hard to finish grooming on time when had to answer the phone 25 times while grooming one dog. Also, bathroom at back of store required leaving the shop which slowed us down because customers requested assistance when we were seen on the way to the bathroom. So breaks and meals were difficult expecially during holidays."

PetSmart,1c88fjbfcaqjgerp,4.0,I was a retail manager for years. I found out I was pregnant and I needed to step to a lower job position due to health reasons and me still being an undergraduate student with a full-time internship. PetSmart worked with me and they were very supportive. I would not have taken the job if I was not pregnant but I'm glad this is where I worked during my pregnancy.
PetSmart,1c889lfeoak7p84l,5.0,"This was my first job out of high school.  Petsmart gave me a chance to work.  I enjoyed my job, especially interacting with the customers.  I also enjoyed working with the pets.  My immediate supervisor was wonderful to work with.  The only thing that I didn't like was the job was seasonal."
PetSmart,1c86uajkq1ah041u,1.0,"I had high hopes coming into the company. They paid training to become a groomer. I love the job, but the management is terrible. Issues get swept under the rug. No flexibility or compassion for their employees."
PetSmart,1c86jqar2aqjgb7k,4.0,"my typical day at work was good, I would clock in and start my cashier, working at pet smart was a good place and I have learned allot more about customer service , My manager was very nice and vey easy to talk to, pet smart was a very clean place for customers and pets. there was nothing hard about working at pet smart, i am very easy going person  and My patients with work is awesome . the best part of pet smart was working with the customers and seeing different personality's and all kinds of pets come in ."
PetSmart,1c86evfkdak7pb7v,4.0,"It is a fun environment to work in, but certain members of the management team took away from that experience. I would recommend working there as an entry-level associate, but advancement into management level positions seem rare."
PetSmart,1c85tpe1baqjgf5b,5.0,I really enjoy my job but they keep hiring people and not giving the people there the hours they deserve. They give the hours to new people. If I could get more hours and make at least 9.00hr i would definitely stay.
PetSmart,1c842m6ilakfdde1,4.0,"My favorite part about working at PetSmart is the animals, I loved all the animals that would come into the store. Ive seen pigs, hedgehogs and sugar gliders. I love that about the job."

PetSmart,1c83jr24c5nbmbfn,3.0,Enjoyed my position here very much.  The store manager was great as was the regional.  The district manager was quite difficult to get along with as he was a bit shady.
PetSmart,1c83id6avakjc9f1,3.0,"Typical work day consist of cleaning, bathing dogs, cleaning ears, clipping nails. I learned how to cut nails. Workplace was fast paced and fun very social. Most enjoyable part of the job was the animals."
PetSmart,1c81qpp835nbkfln,4.0,"Overall, I had a good experience in my four years at petsmart. Sometimes there are horrible customers, but that is in any retail job. Make sure you have a good manager. They can make or break a company."
PetSmart,1c81cmv2e5nbkfqh,4.0,"Very fun environment to work in if you like pets of almost any kind. Great place to learn tricks, techniques, and overall knowledge about raising and helping animals. Friendly atmosphere with an equally friendly customer base."
PetSmart,1c8168ghp52vnahe,2.0,I enjoyed my clients much more than I enjoyed working for the company. It was very stressful to not get any help to move up in the workplace. I have definitely improved my customer service skills.

PetSmart,1c80uguv8ak7ofvd,4.0,Did enjoy working here temporarily. Cowrokers were fun and interesting to work with. Didn't have any problems with management. Pay was pretty fair and could bring my own dogs in to bathe for free. Got discounts at any PetSmart location. Can be really stressful at times as a bather because bathers must take all walk-ins and normally there is only one bather there at a time. Manager was great and I really enjoyed working there.
PetSmart,1c80rvh7fakjbfvf,1.0,"Petsmart used to be an awesome place to work for, after it was bought out, everything change, cooperate does not care about employees, they believe we are machines, and only care about money. i can write a whole book of everything thats wrong with this company but it wont make a difference since big cooperates always win. just know petsmart will start getting a bad rep with animal incidents due to stressed out and under paid employees."
PetSmart,1c80k39r45j7adfa,2.0,"I had a stint at Gamestop for a week and got called back two weeks later telling me to come in for a shift I didn't know I even had; already hired at PetSmart. That feeling of uncertainty and confusion basically sums up my career at PetSmart. Terrible management, terrible customer service, no connectivity with the customer at all and if there was it was forced by tracking down folks in the aisle to sell them garbage to meet a quota every month. I could go on but it's not worth it, I was told even by one of my close team mangers that this job was not worth the effort with minimum payout."
PetSmart,1c7v2o7g35nbj82i,4.0,I’d recommend anybody to work here as long as you’re willing to work fast and accurately. Otherwise you’ll never make it. It’s a very fun job and all of you coworkers are nice and helpful when needed
PetSmart,1c7uvh7g5brfkav1,4.0,Hours are usually early in the morning. Must be ahead of schedule to be able to succeed this position. Not waste a single minute and hire the right help.

PetSmart,1c7us4fh0b87vap3,3.0,"The beginning of the day is exciting and they keep you updated, along with your daily stretches. I learned how to pick and pack at an exceptional rate. The management lacked in many areas and only came around under pressure of their bosses. Employees there were standoffish and uninviting at times. The hardest part of my day was trying to get the hands free headset to hear and process what I was saying. The best part was the exercise."
PetSmart,1c7uir9bk52vnes2,5.0,you must have a passion for pets. i do and did. great place to learn and care about our furry friends. darrel and cathy at brannon crossing location in nicholasville ky are awesome people to work with!
PetSmart,1c7ufohkm5nfhcni,4.0,"I loved my job in pet care and I’d do it all again, but we had such poor management that it made me dread going in to work. I loved meeting customers who were pet owners, seeing young kids interested in the reptiles, and being able to answer all the questions they had. I never got trained so all the information I learned was through experience or researching on my own time."
PetSmart,1c7u7jnt3akbv8ji,4.0,"I work in the grooming salon so I'm not sure how it is in the rest of the store. They started me as a bather and within months I was going to groom school. They pay for school as well, though you do have to sign a 2 year contract with the company. The job can be stressful but if you love dogs it's a ton of fun. There's room to make a lot of money off of commissions, too."
PetSmart,1c7spcda9akf7cg8,4.0,"This job was never just playing with dogs, or bubbles and puppies.  It is hard manual labor, including custodial duties and tool maintenance, as well as reception and customer service.  This is a multifaceted, fast paced job, and for this company there is a demand for your performance in numbers and sales.  This grooming department also boasts the values of transparency and personal accountability, as well as high safety standards and a low tolerance for safety incidents.  My canine customers, regular request clients, and team members make this job worth it."
PetSmart,1c7sdc68mbrfe9ot,3.0,"you learn alot about fish, dog, cat, diets, habits, techniques of approaches different people. starts day by opening registers, front doors, organizing merchandise in your department, ringing people up on registers, helping coworker out with task, email captures, selling puppy guides, talking people into getting dog training lessons, collecting online orders, meet and greet with customers and their pets. then closing the store by putting away go backs, fixing shelves , collecting shopping carts."
PetSmart,1c7rkbat95nbffdn,3.0,Being a dog groomer is messy but it has it's perks. Have to be tough to be able to handle anything that comes in. Works closely with a small group of people so you have to be easy to get along with.
PetSmart,1c7rile0caqja815,5.0,typical day vat work would be stocking n cashier when i originally applied for dog bather n they had me doing everything but that but other then that it was a very nice place to work with including the animals
PetSmart,1c7r7isot5nbfefm,2.0,"I liked working there when I was just a part time pet care associate. By the time I was offered full time, we had new management, we were suddenly micromanaged by managers that rarely left the office. They have no respect for associates, talk down to you, turn and walk away from you while you're discussing something related to your work. Other employees would butter up to leaders and constantly undermine you. I was often overloaded with the CEL and MIL duties. Then brow beaten when I couldn't get my stuff done because the MOD would give me other tasks they wanted done first. I was told that I was being prepped for the CEL job, and was doing most of the duties after the CEL quit. Then they gave it to someone else that had zero clue on the job."
PetSmart,1c7r7a831akj6esf,3.0,I worked here for my first job. It was a horrible first job. I was treated like trash by all coworkers and managers. They got mad when I didn’t have anything to do so gave me stupid things to do to pass the time and keep busy. This was 3 years ago so it might be different.
PetSmart,1c7q8ujonb8bhf72,4.0,"Nothing spectacular, retail job gone into management. Learned good basic skills in retail management and running retail stores. Learned to manage people and customers.

PetSmart,1c7i7oi52akbpcfe,5.0,I loved walking into work to see my co-workers and then to greet customers. Going to work there was the highlight of my day all the time. I enjoyed it more than anything.
PetSmart,1c7hcbq7l52vi82h,4.0,"Management didn’t seem to understand the difference job requirements for our position on a day-to-day basis,  supplies were always out and on the back order,  many safety concerns for pet and employee safety."
PetSmart,1c7gbnmluak7i9dk,1.0,I was harassed and not treated fairly. The management was the worst and did nothing to help. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone due to my experience
PetSmart,1c7fteli5b83od5d,5.0,I come in early in the morning and have tasks I need to complete and it is an easy to follow the structure. Fun to see all the different animals come in to the store.
PetSmart,1c7fsq1dkb83o88m,2.0,This was a great place to work up until 2010. The focus towards the bottom line caused a cultural shift that makes it unbearable for associates. Upper management is quick to inform employees of their expendable worth and your family obligations mean nothing to them. You are a number and their profit work horse.
PetSmart,1c7fnvri6akj49fr,5.0,"the whole company is just so positive and obviously being around animals all the time is awesome.  i absolutely loved it there, only left because i was pregnant and couldn't stand for prolonged periods of time and decided to become a stay at home parent."
PetSmart,1c7fhqvk9akj4cn4,3.0,The company seems to hire external candidates instead of qualified internals. The hours are good and the bonus program was nice because it included everyone
PetSmart,1c7esrkd3brfb8u0,4.0,"The management and my coworkers were almost always wonderful. However, being a mom, a student, and working overnights just became too much, I was sleep deprived and every part of my life began to suffer. The animals were awesome, seeing them get excited to you helped get through the long, cold nights alone. (and boy was it cold overnight.) You pretty much didn't stop moving the entire night, from cleaning out kennels, to feeding 7-177 animals in a single night, usually alone, cleaning grooming rooms and dishes, cleaning playrooms with chemicals, and so, much, laundry. It was hard work, and i can honestly say i loved my job, but my school, and my daughter are more important to me than 177 a week, and i needed to leave in order to have the energy necessary to do those instead."
PetSmart,1c7ek9h55akj49vl,4.0,Managers are super nice and helpful when I worked there. I always felt appreciated and there was never any drama. It's a very easy fun first job. And they are always willing to train in other areas.
PetSmart,1c7e7blml52vg9qo,5.0,managed people - pet partners are fun to work with very different than any other retail company.  hours were okay except had to go in on holidays and feed animals
PetSmart,1c7e6jvqpak7g8mg,5.0,PetSmart is a great place to work for a pet lover. Getting to work and learn more about animals was a great experience for me. The staff and management team worked really good together.
PetSmart,1c7dkthkkakf5c4k,3.0,"it was very stressful under management. There's a huge turnover and you basically need to kiss up to management to get a decent amount of hours, no matter how hard you work."
PetSmart,1c7c5o9qvb87kb28,4.0,"got to learn a lot about different types of animals. all the different type of food there where, and witch best fit for the animal. meet new people and pets"
PetSmart,1c7c069h3aqj89ju,5.0,"If you are able to play by the rules (as you would anywhere), then you will love the culture.  It is an amazing company to be employed with.  Management is very compassionate and truly cares about employee well-being (at least at my location).  Employees view and treat Pet Parents as a family which drives them to return; therefore, allowing us to get to know each and every one of them more.  Each day consists of different goals and tasks so it never gets boring."
PetSmart,1c7aiu5r2aqj58eg,5.0,"Great company, they worked around your schedule and gave advancement opprotunities. great place to work. management seemed to actually care. all employees cared about customer service"
PetSmart,1c7ahc3mfbrf7fjt,4.0,"This is a wonderful job with mostly great management. The task of pet care is a very knowledge intensive task. The pay for this task does not reflect the knowledge required on each and every animal in the store. Nor does it reflect the fact that pet care associated generate a large portion of the store's sales based on species specific recommendations. That being said, I found this job to be fulfilling and work environment to be friendly and pleasant."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1c7ae9gmrb87geh8,2.0,"They don't reward loyal employees. Extremely small raises even with high review scores. Management does the bare minimum. corporate now only cares about the bottom line, not about pet and associate safety."
PetSmart,1c7a4eogaakf2a1a,3.0,"I actually really enjoy working there. Working with the animals is so cool, and you learn so much about all the different kinds of animals they sell. The only problems are that the pay is too low and there is not enough hours."
PetSmart,1c79j6at9akf2d9u,4.0,"In a typical day of I would manage the in-store inventory by stocking the shelves. I learned a lot about the product, the purchasing and ordering system, and time management. The workplace culture was laid back, stressful at times, but very enjoyable. The employees were dedicated and focused and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was controlling the inventory. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the other employees."
PetSmart,1c78329kcakf2apk,3.0,As a newly experienced dog groomer/bather alot was expected of me  and individuals who had been employed at this petsmart made it difficult for new comers like myself to feel comfortable.
PetSmart,1c77pjab1akj1da7,3.0,"store was constantly changing managers, key holders were always coming and going. Forced into doing role play exercises - which is terrible for someone with anxiety - like me."
PetSmart,1c76rb733akf2802,3.0,Takes advantage of groomers. They make the groomers in academy pay for all of  their own equipment and pay for their blade sharpening throughout their career.
PetSmart,1c75s56t2ak7cej5,3.0,Fun Co workers management sucks though and it's hard to move up In the company. The managers didn't always help or know what they were doing. It's hard when they don't have your back
PetSmart,1c75dcf6bb8ba8l2,4.0,Gives you the opportunity to learn valuable skills in customer service as well as animal exposure and experience. Is very flexible and allows opportunity to cross train.
PetSmart,1c74jtrfoakf2a9i,2.0,"people are so quick to point fingers, theres lack of training there and they expect you to go above and beyond. When a situation occurs they dont bother to hear your side of a story because the customer is always right."
PetSmart,1c74iuqlib83jeoo,3.0,"If you have a good management team the company as a whole is great. However as with any job, poor management in a location can ruin your experience. Best of luck."
PetSmart,1c73h5c5haqj5dut,4.0,"Typical retail environment, high turnover rate, people drama is the biggest issue. Fair pay, not much opportunity to advance, but pretty flexible hours."
PetSmart,1c72506mh5j718bv,3.0,\i loved working there because the experince with animals and learning things that dog owners don't know on the daily basis. the only problem is that you are not to progress to better performance in a different environment if you don't have a good relationship with your manager.
PetSmart,1c71ukkcub87gaqf,5.0,"If you love being in an ever changing enviornment while getting to see new animals everyday, this is the job for you. Petsmart is a fun, goal-oriented place to work."
PetSmart,1c71mie2bakf2cf4,5.0,"i loved working at petsmart and i reallt enjoyed the girls i worked with in the salon also, the rules that were placed down made sense and i loved working with animals and people that made work enjoyable"
PetSmart,1c71aqc6lak7ced4,4.0,Not every store is the same but they have ups and downs. Getting along with everyone and working as a team helps out a lot. Just make sure you’re always smiling and talking to everybody that comes in. Great customer service is key!
PetSmart,1c6vv94stakbif7u,2.0,Management sucked. The pay was horrible. Not enough hours. you  barely can make ends meet. Not a good job for someone trying to support a family. More of a job for high schoolers and college students.
PetSmart,1c6vgeqadakj1bhq,4.0,I was hired on as a Merchandise manager and worked my way up to store manager. The hardest part of the job was the specialty area of the small animals. Otherwise I enjoyed the job very much.
PetSmart,1c6vf0sqqb87ge7r,3.0,"Loved the challenge of the workload and type of work I was doing. I was not passionate about pets, and this fact alone drove me out because of the pressure surrounding ""being an outcast""."
PetSmart,1c6v9445gaqj5fhe,4.0,Quick moving work environment
PetSmart,1c6v8gnjrakj1e83,4.0,"PetSmart has been a good place to work for mostly. Recent cut backs on hours has made it a little bit rough though, as customers have been getting annoyed when there is no one available to help them because associates are already helping other people."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1c6v0r5jcakbic75,2.0,"Very few hours, lots of misleading, poor management. I applied to be a bather\ groomer got put in pet care for two weeks and then landed on register and haven't left since. Email capture is more important than it should be. Petsmart is the only company that hasn't appreciated my experience or work ethic."
PetSmart,1c6tr1plaak7a94m,3.0,Grooming and bathing dogs is really fun! If you are wanting to create a non- stressful environment for dogs this is probably not the place for you.   Grooms have to be done at such a pace that any dog that is nervous doesn't have time to acclimate.
PetSmart,1c6thokdfaqj38i3,4.0,"A typical day at work was fast paced and busy yet at the same time it was fun and enjoyable. I learned how to communicate better, use my time wisely, and how to restock merchandise. Management was always polite, helpful, and available when needed. The hardest part about the job was pleasing each and every customer. The best part about the job was getting to know all the people I worked with."
PetSmart,1c6tbib1hakiv9np,4.0,It all depends on the store really. My store has good people which makes it a good envirment. The pay isn't great but its ok for a student or someone young as a part time job.
PetSmart,1c6t7r5itbrf4a7g,3.0,"Fast paced ,good place to work in for the schedule , not great place advancement. Overall wouldn't recommend if your looking for long term stay. Was dedicated to this company for 14+ years then managment changed and seemed racists againts certain people. Got terminated for an issue I kept bringing up to them , altho they didn't give a real reason to terminate me I had proof for everything they tried to use against me ..."
PetSmart,1c6smk6flak7adci,4.0,I enjoyed working there mainly because I was around animals all the time. I didn’t give here a perfect rating because I am a colleg student and they didn’t always work with my class schedule. I ended up losing a lot of hours that I could’ve worked because of it.
PetSmart,1c6shama95nb69sv,4.0,It was an experience working with all different types of animals. It was really fun when the shelters came with all the puppies and kittens. The staff was super nice and fun.
PetSmart,1c6r58da5aqj3944,4.0,a typical day at work was fun. the weekends weren't so much fun. they got really crazy busy and most of the time someone would call out. we would be understaffed and the store manager didnt like to do much while the mangers would work extra hard. also we never knew when they would cut our hours.
PetSmart,1c6qgr7nvak769hf,3.0,"A typical day as a Pet Care Associate includes assisting customers with questions regarding the care of fish, small animals, reptiles and birds. You will be bagging and selling crickets, bagging and selling fish, ensuring the well being of all store animals,  be responsible for properly filling out paperwork for adopting out animals, adopting out other animals from local rescue agencies that are partnered with PetSmart and much more. There is a lot to remember with policies (it seems to change frequently) which are not always made clear to you by management which can make things difficult at times. This is not a cushy job, be prepared to get dirty and work hard as you will be constantly cleaning animal habitats, scrubbing fish tanks, cleaning up after peoples' pets, (etc.). You do get to meet a lot of cool customers that share a passion for animals, and sometimes you get to interact with their pets (be sure to ask owners' permission first!) which definitely makes the work day more fun. Be aware that there are short time constraints on daily tasks (there is A LOT to do) and if you don't meet those management will come down on you, so good time management is a must for working here! Some days are absolute chaos and customer flow is non-stop; be prepared to be the only one in Pet Care department for your shift most of the time!"
PetSmart,1c6qfr3b3brf1989,4.0,"The job required a lot of learning, from processes, to caring for customers and pets. It is an amazing company to work for. there is an absolute amount of growth opportunities to grow with the company and the sky is the limit with hard work. It really pays well if you show great ethic and determination. Management teams are absolutely fun to work with. they show recognition for the good work fulfilled. I have learned to be able to point out my strengths and weaknesses so I can be able to fix whats holding me down with all of the support from their teams. Teamwork skills are something I have bettered after just the first month. They set a friendly environment that makes it comfortable. One of the hardest parts of the job is having to break out of a bubble, they make it easy, but teamwork is a big emphasis in this company and the job really pushes you to get comfortable doing so. But the great thing is you get to hang out with animals everyday. From dogs being brought in, the regulars who play in the day camps, seeing dogs constantly getting groomed and coming back with crazy coats. Even in the selling side of it all, theres adoptions, where you get to work with shelter teams and help get pets into a forever home, or caring for the reptiles and little furry animals, its a pleasure to be able to come to work and be surrounded with creatures. The company really shows care in their employees, and it shows when you get into the store with an instant feeling of excitement."
PetSmart,1c6q5cd5m5nb3fjt,1.0,Once the company was bought a few years ago the management of pets and employees went down hill. they don't seem to care about their team any more ...
PetSmart,1c6q4as3kakev9fi,1.0,Typically if your a cashier aside from zoning the first two aisles you can not leave the register. You work with many forms of payment and coupons. There is not much room for growth with the company with the exception of groomers and vet technicians. The hardest part of the job is hearing about customers with sick or special need pets.
PetSmart,1c6ogd9ubaqj2865,4.0,fun work environment but high turn over.loved most of my coworkers but some were stuck up. If I had the chance id work there again.The company sold out to a private equity firm
PetSmart,1c6o628jbaqj2dht,3.0,Management is awful. There is only one manager who treats the people below them like they are people and not dirt. There is no chance of advancement if the managers do not like you. Working with the animals is the only thing that makes the job enjoyable.
PetSmart,1c6o4bgs8akevce5,4.0,"Great enviornment, pay lower end of retail for hourly associates. The push for customer service is weighed heavily by the operational items that must happen in a store. Really a tough one to shift away to the customers."
PetSmart,1c6o2bu1mbrf189b,4.0,"A typical day at work involved answering the phones, booking appointments for guests, dealing with inquiries/complaints and completing any given task. Management at my store has been friendly and understanding. The hardest part of my job is dealing with dogs that do not enjoy being groomed. When this happens, i have to be very cautious in order to ensure the safety of myself and the pet. However, working with animals is the most enjoyable part of my job."
PetSmart,1c6nmmfmk52v5f00,5.0,I loved working there I got sent to school for grooming also learned all new things working there as well they helped me when I went on maternity leave and I also learned how to set up a whole new store.
PetSmart,1c6m3umbsak76c5b,1.0,"Its a bad to place to work at, they run you ragged for most of the day. The managers don't have your back at all when a customer is attacking you. Communication is not key what so ever, the animals don't get taken care of as to what they are suppose to be."
PetSmart,1c6m3pnm9b83dcim,5.0,A typical day at Pet Smart begins with manager meetings reviewing company goals and sharing employee expectations for the day.  As a pet stylist you do thorough check ins of the dogs and groom them in a top of the line salon environment.  Pet Smart is strict on their safety procedures so if you are conscientious you will do great!  If you are full time benefits are provided as well as vacation.
PetSmart,1c6luk2udb83dc4v,5.0,"Everyone was so friendly and helpful, made you feel welcome.  Training was good, someone always there to get from if needed, made sure you were taken care of."

PetSmart,1c6lnmt6oakbcat9,3.0,"This is a good first job for people with a strong interest in animals.  Over my years, I experienced some really poor upper management and didn't see women in positions of power although they were the hardest working and smartest ones there."
PetSmart,1c6krunvt5j6rd9n,3.0,as far as a company  in the years u worked there they went through a lot of changed some i did not agree with what so ever. they   need to get there stuff together.
PetSmart,1c6ill94vbrf1e2p,1.0,"I love being a petstylist, there's nothing I love more than working with animals! I have never felt more connected within a job than I have when I am working with dogs. However I don't think Petsmart was the best choice for me. I do love how they provide you with all the education, training, and the tools, but I think their sincerity is severely lacking. There's a huge disconnect between management and stylists, as well as an even bigger disconnect between Pet parents, groomers, and management. It used to be a great company to work for, however, I feel the corporate side has definitely gotten the best of them. They ask for quite a tremendous amount of work in such a short 8 hours with very unrealistic expectations;  and for that, the reward is pretty much non existent and this time. Its definitely taken away the quality time I would much rather like to spend with each pet parent where I can really build that bond and make a life time connection with their little furry friend. Petsmart needs to get it together."
PetSmart,1c6ia977gaqj29jt,4.0,"Working there was great, until they started to take away some of the things that made being an established, long term employee, attractive. They capped the amount of vacation time received. Rarely got reviews or was told anything until there was a list of things I had done wrong to go through."
PetSmart,1c6h1tees5nf2c30,3.0,"There was a lot of gossip and unprofessional behaviour on the part of some of the managers and some of the employees. Being asked to work 7 consecutive days and then receiving an attitude when I refused to cover someone's shift made me uncomfortable. Young, immature staff."
PetSmart,1c6gqg3sub8799nh,5.0,The managers are helpful. We are rewarded often. The pay is competitive. Overall it was a good experience working here. If I wasn't moving I would stay.
PetSmart,1c6gga370brf1c99,5.0,"PetSmart was a great place to work. Everyone who worked there had a genuine love for animals and it made a very fun and enjoyable work environment. Management at a store level was great but at a district level was very difficult to work for. Standards were not equal for every store and made for some difficult work relationships. Working retail is not for everyone, especially during peak seasons, but it definitely gave me a lot of skills in dealing and working with the general public"
PetSmart,1c6gav3uo5j6reul,4.0,"I worked here over the summer and it was somewhat fun. I applied to be a cashier, but was introduced to more duties as my employment went on. On a typical day, I would clock in, take over for other workers at the register, straighten up the treat wall, and then go through the aisles, cleaning and restocking product. On shipment days, I would help other workers to unload the truck and stock the shelves. The management was okay. I got along with each manager, but the main manager was kind of sarcastic and rude. I really enjoyed the people I worked with and getting to work with animals and pet parents. The worst part of the job was trying to setup new shelves and displays a day before corporate wanted them done. Management was very last minute, and piled the work on us the day before corporate would have scheduled the new displays."
PetSmart,1c6fpq1v6ak76fcv,3.0,As an animal lover this job is perfect for getting to know all the product and what's best for my animals and pet parents animal is the best part. Working with animals of all type small and large happy and feisty is a blessing everyday.
PetSmart,1c6fo2b7aakire1r,1.0,Decent place to work but the lifting was too heavy. I didn't like the weekend shift because I had to get up super early. It wasn't convenient for me at all.
PetSmart,1c6fmn8d7akbcbne,4.0,"This is a great  place to work.  Other employees are nice,  and the management is very competent and nice and helpful.  Sometimes the employees don't get enough hours, but management usually tries to give enough hours."

PetSmart,1c6e9ptnvakerb5f,1.0,"Cut throat place to work!!!! Was terminated for minor incident by persons in another state over the phone. No former problems first incident no warning, with no opportunity to defend self. Have seen posting for same position several times online!!!"
PetSmart,1c6e5f5tsb879f7q,4.0,I've been there for 13 years now. It's like another set of family.  I do think we should be paid better and there should be more advancements for people.
PetSmart,1c6dujhej52v58dl,3.0,"The job typically included making your own appointments with clients to bathe and groom dogs. I learned how to interact with animals in a professional environment. The management was decent, not great because it didn't seem like there was a lot of control over the environment of the salon.  The workplace culture wasn't that great because there wasn't that much job security, but the ethics and expectations of the company were very high."
PetSmart,1c6dkj8fdaqiveso,2.0,"A typical day at petsmart consist of me assisting customers to find the right product as well as training dogs, I would cash out customers at the cash register as well and try and get people to get there dogs signed up for any classes."
PetSmart,1c6dbva5qak76d43,5.0,"A typical day at work was taking care of the animals and making sure that they got the medications and feed that they required. It also involved deep cleaning the cages, misting the reptiles, and keeping the back room clean. I also bagged fish and crickets for the customers that requested them."
PetSmart,1c6b57dmjaqin8h4,3.0,"Working in the PetSmart salon can be very fun and exciting. It is also so much more than just playing with dogs all day though. This is high stress, but rewarding work."
PetSmart,1c6aq5spi5nam9nm,5.0,"While working at Petsmart I was part time and would usually 6 hours a day for 4 days a week. I learned almost everything I know about animals while working those two years at Petsmart. The previous store manager, while being a very easy person to talk to was not a good manager and would act more like a friend than a boss and would not take any of the store problems seriously unless his job was in danger. The workplace culture was diverse and like with anyplace you work their was conflicts between workers but for the most part everyone was friendly and willing to help cover other peoples spots if the store were to get busy, which was often. The hardest part of the job was when a customer would come in and we did not have what they were looking for and would have to tell them to go somewhere else to find what they were looking for. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the joy on a customers face when they go home with a new furry friend and a new addition to their family. Out of all the jobs I've had in my life, this was my favorite place I have ever worked and the job where I learned the most."
PetSmart,1c6aik8cv5namd5r,4.0,"Fun place to work.  Cultivating a relationship with the regular customers that come in and getting to know them, their pet, and the needs of both is very rewarding.  It also does not hurt that you get  to be around all different animals everyday."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1c69c6bifak6navj,4.0,"typical work day is usually spent facing products on floor, and taking care of customers needs at register. It's usually either very slow, or very quick paced. managers aren't on top of breaks or when they happen. You basically get paid to listen to customers complain about things they bought too long ago to be returned, break up dog fights, or pet dogs. I thought I'd love working at petsmart, but management cuts hours without warning and the pay is horrible."
PetSmart,1c6943lct52uk90h,1.0,"You work with great people and awesome leaders. Its really laid back and fun. If the pay was better I would of stayed. The store manager had favorites, that’s the only problem I had. And treated the non favorites disrespectfully."
PetSmart,1c691ijm1b82ubka,5.0,Best part is seeing all different pets coming in to the store and helping customers find here forever pet. Always busy but never a dull moment. Really great to work with all of the animals in the store
PetSmart,1c68uvcqp5namaro,4.0,"It's a fun place to work if you like animals and can relate to people with pets, of all kinds. If you are a cashier, there is a lot of pressure put on you for getting donations, getting people's email address, and getting people signed up for PetPerks! At my store if one person has a group of customers that doesn't want PetPerks or does not want to give you their email, that one cashier brings down the score for the whole store. It doesn't make you feel very good and really isn't fair. You can't control all the customers! They will work with you on scheduling. I really need full time and took the job at part time thinking it would give me an opportunity for advancement. It hasn't! And after talking to the other employees, it probably won't be much offered. The last few months I have gotten 26-28 hours a week, this week I was scheduled 13 hours! All in all, it's a relaxed and fun environment. I personally like to stay really busy all the time but at my store, if your a cashier, they expect you to just stand at the register and do nothing if there are no customers!"
PetSmart,1c68sqtvmakifbhf,5.0,I loved working at PetSmart my co-workers were amazing and the customers were happy with an open ear and Help on better care of animals. Every once in a while there was that one customer but my co-workers were always there to give encouragement. Management was understanding of life issues and willing to help how ever they could. Sadly unless your full time no benefits but had opportunity for growth.
PetSmart,1c68sl8tl52ukcca,2.0,Best college job I had. Was able to look forward to my job everyday because of my love of animals. Not the best pay at the time of me working there. Management was very fair and respectful
PetSmart,1c68ofa4tb8am9uq,5.0,This company trained me very well. I became very knowledgeable in pet care products and customer  service. It was a fun environment to work in; everyday is different.
PetSmart,1c68h6tbab86rc6k,4.0,this is a great 1st job to learn customer service skills and animal service skills if you are a hard worker it will pay off as long in the long run you can easily move up to management
PetSmart,1c68f1ul2ak6nd9f,3.0,"It's great for the first few years but everyone burns out after two or three years. There's a revolving door of co-workers, nobody lasts long which is depressing. It gets too competitive in the grooming salon, and there is a lot of drama. I'm looking forward to moving on. Oh, and in my three years there two co-workers got arrested for stealing. Shows you the kind of people they hire."
PetSmart,1c688roi1ak6nbq4,4.0,"Dog bathing and grooming is not an easy job. Its tough work but rewarding. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone who is lazy or wants just a ""fun"" job. It takes commitment. Good place to learn how to groom."
PetSmart,1c688712l52ukajv,4.0,"I really enjoyed my time at PetSmart.  I worked in animal care and cleaned, fed, and cared for all the small pets they sold.  The procedures in place for the animals' safety were good and (at least where I worked) everyone followed them."
PetSmart,1c683fqui52uke1t,4.0,"First job at the age of 16. Overall positive experience, worked there over 10 years ago so the job environment has changed. Some matters needed to be handled a little less by corporate oversight."
PetSmart,1c66k6rvpakaufll,5.0,Starting as a cashier I quickly used my customer service expertise to help guide the Pet Parents in the right direction to make not only their life easier but their pets as well. The managemnet is a strong core team that thrives on communication and doing the right thing by the customer.
PetSmart,1c66boh14akaufbs,3.0,"This was a busy place to work, very cramped environment, groomers were out to sabotage each other to get more dogs to make more comissions, hours were not good"
PetSmart,1c668eds95nelc2m,2.0,it was a fun place to work because you can see animals all the time. The dogs that come in make it worth working. I got to know some customers and their dogs so they know and recognize me when they come in.
PetSmart,1c668dcv1b8amc5p,4.0,"Could have had a better experience with things getting handled better but not to bad of a place to work, learned a lot as a person as well as an employee."
PetSmart,1c65ph2kuakiff8b,3.0,"Poor managers, a rotating list of coworkers, little to no hours, and low pay in addition. Management will push policies that are not to the animals' benefits,"
PetSmart,1c65kvb7pb86rfco,4.0,Good experiences with management and Team. Management is Supportive and flexible. Team works well with each other and helps when asked. Everyone seems to enjoy their job
PetSmart,1c635cjonakauad1,3.0,"I started there with a vision of becoming a great Pet Stylist. While I love the message of the company and their vision, the team leaders that i worked under were very catty and liked to have cliques and choose favorites like it was high school all over again. Even during my grooming school , I noticed this was an issue at other stores we worked with in their teams as well. The job itself wasn't that hard. I loved establishing a relationship with the clients but the expectations of how many dogs per day i had to do was more of an assembly line where it was quantity over quality. You cannot have that attitude when dealing with living beings. I left on a moral ground."
PetSmart,1c633mujgakau8fr,5.0,"I liked working at PetSmart. Could be stressful at times. I enjoyed working with the different staff, managers and animals. I learned how to communicate and delegate to employees and other members of management."

The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1c62tu31vb82ua0k,5.0,This job is a very rewarding type of job when you help someone find the right product to help their dog or when someone needs help I can help put them into the right direction if I can be no help to them at all. It's a very fun and fast paced job. You get to see all sorts of different animals and watch the kids face light up when they get a new fish or a new hamster.
PetSmart,1c62nhfefakau8s8,2.0,"4, 5 years ago the company had a different tone. Now it's all about profits, micromanaging, and write ups. The company cares more about profits than thier actual employees, set pushy standards on the employee to pressure the customer. The company cares about safety,  but there's so many policies often pointless to follow that it becomes impossible to do your job and actually enjoy it.  Being a manager you get paid decently, but not nearly enough."
PetSmart,1c62cktbrakeid36,1.0,"I've worked at a few different PetSmart salons, and they are not all equally terrible, but the culture was similar in all of them. A culture that did not care for the safety of the pets and sanitation guidelines, a culture that only cared about the commission on a groom and speeding through as many a day as possible disregarding the safety of the pets. This is not the employees fault, management understaffs and overbooks forcing employees to do sub standard work. The last PetSmart I worked at, when i first stepped in the back of the grooming salon, I was shocked at how completely filthy it was.. totally unacceptable. PetSmart only cares about what the customer can see.. they do NOT care about their employees or the pets in their care."
PetSmart,1c61bemmqaqiib0f,5.0,Work culture encourage a strong team environment. Workplace culture provided the ability to grow within the company. Hardest part of the job was willingness to relocate out of state for corporate a position.

PetSmart,1c60vlnh25naibf9,4.0,"A pet stylist has a very stressful job when busy. Between the opening/closing duties you also have to check in/out your appointments and coworkers appointments, groom dogs, answer phones, make appointments and take walk ins. you must work weekends and holidays."
PetSmart,1c60spqqbb82ueug,1.0,Lying Management.  You have to sleep your way to the top.  Makes you do jobs below your pay grade   Management is a joke.  Managers a mostly fresh out of school with no real world experience. Promotions are based on who hangs out with who outside of work.
PetSmart,1c60qv93l5naiadk,2.0,The hours were not great in that I could work only 8 hours one week (two four hour shifts) and others I worked closer to 30. Working at pet smart alone would defiantly not pay the bills or really even give you spending money. Management not supportive of their employees. They were quicker to punish what they saw instead of asking what happened to understand and treat correctly.
PetSmart,1c60pucndb82u980,5.0,"loved this job!! good management, ok pay, benefits, and friendly environment. Only reason for leaving was lack of hours available to me. would recommend this job to others :)"

PetSmart,1c5rimv3k5j6echo,3.0,"I was employed at Petsmart Company for just under two years. Overall, my experience at the company allowed me to grow as an individual with my communication, team building, and customer service skills. A typical shift at this company consisted of monetary transactions, stocking products, answering customer's questions, and referring specific products to satisfy customer needs. The workplace culture was enjoyable and appealed to my interests to supporting animal lovers/families. The hardest portion of this job was the large amount of tasks that were asked of employees in such a short amount of time. The most enjoyable portion of this job was knowing that I was helping owners/families have better care for their pets."
PetSmart,1c5rhc8dqakeea20,5.0,"I submitted an application online and the next day or two i got a call from this guy named David and was asked to come in for an interview.. all that night i was so so so nervous.. The next night about 6 o clock i got a call back asking if i could come in for another interview with the head manager and I was feeling really good about it. I got offered the job and was ecstatic but also nervous at the same time. My first day working there was a little rough but about a week in i felt kinda like we were all one big work ""family"". Everyone was so nice and just made me feel like i belonged there , it was only supposed to be seasonal but here i am 3-4 months later and still there. I love it!"

PetSmart,1c5r33epvakee9e0,3.0,"Working at PetSmart is productive there is always something to do and you can grow up in ranks, by learning from all the departments that's the good think and with having good associates and depending on the managers in the store its great. The only downside about working at PetSmart is the lack of hours and that on busy days we lack associates there isn't enough associates to help out on the sales floor, help in each department and help customers. The other problem is the struggle with the registers they tend to be slow, freeze in the middle of transactions, out of all the phone usually one or two work, the company takes for ever to fix things. The last thing would be how the company demands a lot of sales from associates and the managers are non stop on top of associates pushing for sales sales on specific things because of Corp. and in return the associates just get a recognition."
PetSmart,1c5q1qqi2ake6bhm,3.0,"PetSmart is a fun place to work. They're a bit rigid in terms of ideas and implementation. Shelves and product placement must be precise; according to the guide book. PetSmart is the type of retail that emphasizes specificity and direction. Tasks must be completed a certain way, which should yield a specific-looking result."

PetSmart,1c5oqg4brake6dkc,1.0,"Whatever you do.... do NOT work at Petsmart located in Virginia Beach. I was in the salon... got one day of training before they sent me off on my own expecting to know how to answer phone calls, schedule appointments, clip dogs nails. On my third day of work they had given me two pitbulls, a dog who had never been to the grooming salon before and a Great Dane. I had come home many nights crying to my boyfriend because of how poorly they had treated me in there. And when I needed help they just gave me weird faces and act like it was soooo easy for what I was doing. Speaking of which my manager was only there to watch me my first two days. I had told them I needed more training but recieved none and they expected way to much out of me. They had even told me that 7 people had already quit this position within the past two months. So I know this wasn’t my fault... anyways.. luckily I had taken some time off for Christmas and asked to be switched to a different part of the store cause I could just not handle it in the grooming salon. Anywho... I go into the Pet Care area.. and a cool person trains me but explains to me that he’s only been working there for not even a month and still doesn’t know everything. So I’m like .. great. Anyways... the first few days were fine because I was mainly just watching but then they set me off on my own. Meanwhile I have a customer coming up to me every two seconds asking a question I do not know the answer too. So I have to ask someone to come over and help me which they proceed to do resentfully. Then they expect me to know how to capture a bird"

PetSmart,1c5m75146aki7c6k,4.0,"Working as a Bather in the Grooming Salon is such a fun and interesting job for those who love animals (mostly dogs). Being able to be around dogs all the time working in this type of environment is such a good learning experience. You're really able to learn a lot about how to properly care for dogs and how grooming regularly can extend the life of a dog. Management is very particular about how they want things done to promote safety of all pets. Weekends are usually the busier days in the Salon for both Bathers and Groomers, but either way there is always something to do."
PetSmart,1c5lm63doaqiaea8,4.0,it was a great place to work for that's where I learned all about animals and the care for them some of the management was good there were a few that were questionable I was there for awhile and people that go there after I did were getting raises and more hrs and I was getting nothing
PetSmart,1c5lkqa2g52ucc85,4.0,When i worked at Pet-smart I was mainly a early morning stocker from about 4am in the morning until 9 or 11 am. Making sure merchandise is in the right places. Also was a fork-lift operator pulling and putting up pallets of product.

PetSmart,1c5jgr237akafaof,3.0,Good job. I enjoyed learning about different kinds of animals. I also enjoyed taking care of all the animals. Working for a cooperation is terrible. All they worry about is selling. So I took care of animals to the best of my ability with the lack of supplies and support from some of the management.
PetSmart,1c5i74frtak6cclj,3.0,"Management positions work 10 hr shifts that tend to be stressful but great if you can juggle the hours. If your part time, the discount is great if you have furry friends at home."

PetSmart,1c5gt66qbbre7blv,3.0,"It wasn't foo bad working there. They cut full time hours because management doesn't know how to schedule people there. There's so much favoritism its ridiculous. Its like a high school setting but worse because managers are involved in the gossip. The only redeeming factor was the pups. I worked at the hotel and that's the only thing that kept me going was the dogs. I was full and I closed 4 days out of my 5 work day week. They only let you call out if they like you. I've had to go into working not being able to walk or having fevers and they don't csre, but there were other's that called out because they didn't have rides and they didn't say anything to them."
PetSmart,1c5gn5ouqakaffvg,4.0,A great place to work. Unfortunately I had to quit after 2 weeks due to overwhelming morning sickness. The manager was great. Be ready to stand for long periods of time when learning the register.
PetSmart,1c5f0h8euaki5d0f,5.0,"I started out as a groomer, and it was going okay. I've had some bad experiences with dogs growing up so it was a little tough though trying to get passed that fear, but i couldn't. so i went and cashiered and did stocking, but it did get a little boring at times."
PetSmart,1c5eu7fluaqi6afs,1.0,"I worked as an early morning associate.  The hours were very limited.  I only worked 4 hours a day for less than 4 days a week.  I was seeking full time employment, but they were even trying to reduce those hours."
PetSmart,1c5d3t2os5j659rp,5.0,It’s not a job for everyone. You have to have a passion for animals if not then its no fun. I love working at petsmart. It’s stressful at times but I never feel it.

PetSmart,1c5aeqfs9b86e9t4,3.0,"I enjoyed working there for the first year and a half, but then the job just started getting boring and repetitive. I requested many times to be trained in other areas in the store so i wouldn't get so bored, and also to possibly gain more hours. Management said they would train me but never did."
PetSmart,1c5aa1vo1ak6cdln,1.0,"The managers do not care about you at all. They will find ways to make the work life harder. The job is fast paced and can be very stressful, this can lead to not even being able to take breaks because of the strict time schedules and managers getting angry if you take longer than the expected slots given. Even if they overbooked your schedule they do not care."
PetSmart,1c5a9deekake2eg1,3.0,Good benefits good people but the pay is very low if PetSmart pelota more I think people will stay longer that was an issue with me good environment good management good lunch hours they treat their employees a lot better but the pay is very very low if you're into animals and other positions it's a good place but they must pay a little more to keep people there cuz what you do with animals and everything should tell you that you care about your company and your employees
PetSmart,1c5a62jg9ake2b3v,4.0,"You will learn a lot at PetSmart! So much fun to learn about all the different animals and teaching Pet Parents about them! A typical day at PetSmart for me was cleaning cages, feeding and watering animals, and medicating sick and injured animals. Then once the store is open helping Pet Parents with everything they need. Doing a lot of cleaning throughout the day. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping the animals. The hardest part at first was running around all day, you never stop moving, and of course learning as you go. This job can be a little dirty cleaning up little accidents, cleaning the dead fish out, and doing dishes."
PetSmart,1c5a3r9peak6ccid,4.0,"Seeing the pets is great and helps with the horribly mundane job of a cashier. Standing in the same spot is horrible, but that's not the fault of the company as it is the standard practice for cashiers. The only big negative is that they hound you on getting customer emails and even though you do what they say they still get upset when you don't meet their quota, and you have no ability to change the fact hat people don't want to be spammed by their emails."
PetSmart,1c59o7m3p5na78ee,2.0,"Despite my impeccable work outcome, and phenomenal customer service, i was constantly overlooked for advancement in my position for people who either didn't have the requirements for the job or had only been with the company for a short amount of time. I left a full time job with the promises of being promoted once i had full availability, only to be told the position was no longer available once my two weeks were done with my previous job. I still stayed for 2 years and 6 months."
PetSmart,1c59egpkhaqi6dc0,5.0,Working at petsmart is really fun. Other staff members go above and beyond to not overload you with duties. Sometimes it's difficult taking days off because there is only one other overnight worker
PetSmart,1c57ghlc5aqi4dnl,5.0,"I work mainly on the closing shift helping the animals and customers. All working together. I advanced my knowledge on pet care, and loved the constant knowledge. The most hardest time part about my job is due to the fact that I am a part timer I do not get benefits other than discounts at the store which is great. However I really need benifits that come with a full time job. And for a part timer my hours even sometimes get cut down to the bare minimum mainly when we have over worked our hours. However despite everything I love being around all of those animals and helping them find the forever home."
PetSmart,1c57b8377aqi4c5b,2.0,Management doesn't like to assist cashiers and petcare associates when they are busy and need it.
PetSmart,1c578hg6eak6afqa,3.0,"It's of course not playing with puppies all day. There's more cleaning up after animals than that. You do get to visit with the pets though when they're at your register. They give paid training in the products and services so you know what to recommend. The pay is somewhat good, depending on your manager. What I mean is that depending on the manager, your job is simple if you work hard, or no matter how hard you work it's impossible. The uniforms aren't bad, and you're allowed some movement through positions if you ask. The hardest is cleaning the whole store at the end of the night and dealing with bad customers. At mine, we frequently had fake receipts or people we had to ban because of aggressive behavior or trying to get out of paying for services. People expect you to be an expert on every animal and product even though it's just a supply store, so if you don't have pets you likely won't do well in customer service. Every day is basically bagging fish, recommending products, dealing with angry people, and meeting fun people/pets."
PetSmart,1c576d25cb82baev,1.0,"A typical day at work consists of greeting pet parents and making sure they are attended to.

PetSmart,1c56tn9evbre4ctf,5.0,Retail work is very hard and doesn't give much help with balancing a family life.  Hours are never the same and that makes it hard to enjoy your family and get an education
PetSmart,1c56s3ek8aqi4e5f,4.0,Petsmart is a nice place to learn and grow. I enjoy working with my co workers. The dogs are very fun to play with at times. Very educational on animals.
PetSmart,1c56pp19gb8a8b6t,5.0,As a cashier it was a fun place to work for. The weekends were the busiest. You get to meet a lot of different pets. It was nice to see the love a person can have for their pets.
PetSmart,1c56mcmid5na59b9,1.0,Petsmart as a company is nothing like it used to be. I worked for the company for close to ten years when I was approached by the district manager and told I was a drain on the company and it's resources for not being able to meet the commission goals in the salon where I worked as a dog groomer. They care nothing for their employees and nothing for the animals they sell as pets and for any one interested to know the amount of dogs they push on the groomers makes it fairly unsafe for both dog and groomer in the salon as well. The bottom line is all they care about.
PetSmart,1c56d54goake0a1p,5.0,Petsmart has changed a lot since I was hired.  The company has gone through many ups and downs and leadership changes at a corporate level.  Eventually it will even out at a store level but the transition from public to privately owned company was a challenge
PetSmart,1c555tfflakacc61,2.0,"The management there was really horrible and never bothered to memorize my name, even thought I worked there for over a year. The overall love the associates had for the pets and customers was what mainly kept me going from day to day."
PetSmart,1c54gifnnaqi2epc,2.0,"Poor management, very stressful. Not a pleasant place to work.Great benefits, Great co workers. I was always closing. Not a good life/work balance.Learned to close store and a lot about the care of animals."
PetSmart,1c54g4k1eakaae7k,4.0,"Overall it was a fun and productive place to work.  A place that i hated leaving and would love to work for again.  The management was good and had no problem coming out and helping people on the floor to take care of things, no matter if it was helping someone in the Salon with bathing a dog, or out on the floor stocking things. The workplace over all was upbeat and relaxing."
PetSmart,1c542hun2aki19sn,3.0,advancement was based on how well you were liked by store leader and not on job performance. feedback was inconsistent. so many task and not enough bodies to accomplish everything.
PetSmart,1c53iifrpb8a58og,3.0,Provide lots of customer service
PetSmart,1c53ef0ntb8a5f6h,5.0,"Pet smart was the only job I stayed for more than 2 years. My experience there helped me gain my knowledge of being a sales person and customer service rep, cashier, and animal lover. I started out as a cashier at the costa mesa location and moved to being a bather within 6 months, I was able to transfer to the GG location within a year or so. At first it seems like a stressful job when it's busy and customers are every where, but the overall environment is laid back and fun. I learned a lot as a bather and I don't regret it. I would have moved on to the small animal/ fish area if I didn't quit... Management is tough there and they don't take mistakes lightly. Each part of the store is it's own little clique so if you're able to know all of the areas within 2 years you'll be fine. Playing with puppies, learning from all kinds of animals, and being able to advance within reasonable time are the highlights."
PetSmart,1c52vi10c5j5k86f,5.0,Only downside is you can't take all the animals home with you! I wish starting pay was better. Great managers and coworkers! Hardest part of the job is leaving when you feel like there is so much more you could do!
PetSmart,1c52uh5j7b81u9un,5.0,"Fast paced, always eventful, fun knowledge of animals and unique job tasks to complete regarding all pets. Busy calendar to maintain store order. Not enough hours allotted to competing tasks sometimes, short staffing due to small store size and lack of foot traffic. Culture of store is great, great management."
PetSmart,1c52m4k9vakhobcq,5.0,"very fast paced job. lots of safety policies to follow (reasonable because you are working hands on with live pets), can be stressful at times, the hardest part of the job is the physical strain it takes on the body."
PetSmart,1c52gaurh5ndk9e0,4.0,Mostly slow paced on weekdays. With small rushes here and there. Weekends can be a bit crazy. Basic nightly cleaning is easy and quick. Detail cleaning can take a whole shift.
PetSmart,1c520qk6552tocar,2.0,A lot of hard work for minimum pay and the management was not employee friendly. Unexpected life issues caused problems with management. The other employees were easy to work with.Learning multiply positions could be difficult at first. Being around the animals made it fun.
PetSmart,1c51polndaqhpend,3.0,"As a groomer at Petsmart We were expected to have a certain amount in sales, we were pushed to get more add ons for grooms, in risk of losing our jobs. The longer I stayed the more it seemed the company cared more about the money the the quality of grooms and care for the customers and employees. Management tried to manage the grooming salon with no experience or clue as to how things actually worked in a grooming salon. Managers pushed us to take more dogs than we were comfortable with and to get them done as fast as possible."
PetSmart,1c51p8n1vak65fd4,4.0,"Great company to work for. I would continue if i didn't have a different career goal that I was seeking. The job is fast paced and physically demanding, but the benefits for working for a big company like this are rewarding."
PetSmart,1c51m4ovu5n9l9ak,3.0,It was a very good job by I was only there on temp to hire status. The job was good I drove the forklift there and made good money with good people. Unforgettably I didn't get to stay on full time.
PetSmart,1c51h03ru5j5k9ce,5.0,"If you ever want a fun part time job apply here. Great team, great pay, great benefits, and working with animal!  People always have a great time working here!"
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1c4vo5ntsak5te5v,5.0,Petsmart is a great company to work for they take care of you benefits 401K vacation time  holiday pay I recommend if you like animals petsmart is for you
PetSmart,1c4veik98akdlecf,3.0,Good company to work  for but with all the hours the have cut in the company they are dumping to much on their associates andnot enough time to complete the tasks.
PetSmart,1c4ve08m4akdleap,4.0,"I worked in the Small Animals Department. On a typical work day you would stock product, clean fish tanks, and other animal cages. You would also help customers learn about the animal that they where going to buy, and make sure that they had the proper stuff for them."
PetSmart,1c4uvts1752to89m,2.0,I loved working with the cats but the people in charge were always rude. I eventually stopped going because I always felt like I was in trouble for something.
PetSmart,1c4utvvf45n9la2s,3.0,"Being a cashier at Petsmart is exactly as you'd imagine. You bag groceries, help customers find what they need, clean up the store etc. At my store, we were often understaffed and I was a hard worker so I often had to pick up other's slack. On more than a few occassions my manager and coworker would go out for a smoke break and because I didn't smoke, I would be left inside taking care of the whole store by myself. (We were required to have a minimum of three employees in the store at a time -  a cashier, manager and petcare)."
PetSmart,1c4upkd1sakhofke,5.0,"Had a great time working for the company. However this was also a long time ago and i know things have changed since then. Really enjoyed the employees who were committed  to their jobs and, and enjoyed coming to work. Always took great care of their animals for sale and adoptions. Just at the time there was no room to move up in the company."
PetSmart,1c4tblj4uakhoahj,1.0,"Management is terrible here, very high turnover rate for the Milford store. They play favorites with their employees and look at them as disposable commodities. You will get bullied out, if the right people want you out. The head manager treats women like they are second class and stupid. The salon is the worst, there is a pecking order and its terribly managed. If you want to be a groomer, find a different Petsmart or another program."
PetSmart,1c4su8ets5n9lau9,5.0,Petsmart is a great place to work with great people. They are very flexible with giving time off and listen to what you need. The only thing i wish was that we got longer lunch breaks
PetSmart,1c4st8tgsakhob3q,4.0,"A typical day included cleaning aquariums and habitats, feeding and watering the animals, caring for any sick animals and giving medications if needed, cash register sales, cleaning up messes, talking with customers and informing them about different animals needs and care. I learned a lot about the animals in the store and how to care for them. Management was alright, i was laid off because of money im assuming. I was hired as seasonal and they liked me and kept me for a while but then laid me off. Which was rather annoying since they ended up later firing two employees for stealing and I could have still had a job. Oh well. I would say the hardest part of the job was picking up chinchillas (haha). The job was really fun all around, I loved seeing the animals and giving out milkbones at the register."
PetSmart,1c4qdg6r9ak5tc9l,4.0,"It's only worth it if you absolutely love animals, you'll get a new perspective on them because you're constantly dealing with stressed animals. If you can deal with that then you would be fine,"
PetSmart,1c4q5li7aakdl9kc,3.0,"I started on as a stocker for PetSmart, and now in order to give me more hours my managers have trained me for cashiering and are scheduling for more shifts.  PetSmart is an important store to work at but it is not too fast-paced since customers do not need to come in frequently to attend to their pets' needs."
PetSmart,1c4q3ajbtakdla97,4.0,"The general manager was very nice as well as the salon manager and most others. Very lovely job, accommodated to my needs and worked well with needing time off. Overall very good job."
PetSmart,1c4q0v47paqhp89e,5.0,"PetSmart had a wonderful approach to customer service and made it comfortable to work at the same time. Management is sometimes promoted on a popularity scale, rather than whom the best associates may be."
PetSmart,1c4pkrv6k52to9i1,5.0,"Fast paced, great customers, great to see the pets. Fun place to start out in retail. very educational place to work. Growth and advancement is constant."
PetSmart,1c4o6n340akhod94,3.0,Working with Pets can be very rewarding. You are responsible for the lives and health of pets. Selling skills are a must as training and salon have separate sales goals aside from retail segment of the business.
PetSmart,1c4o4aqttb89vab2,1.0,"Poor pay, inconsistent hours, several hours of standing with feet and back pain with no break, rude and incompetent management, some difficult customers, sometimes noisy and stressful environment. Also hate the constant pressure to sell, collect donations, and email capture pressure for customers to give out emails for marketing purposes. Get paid peanuts to make the company richer. Corporate greed."
PetSmart,1c4o34237akhobmc,5.0,The environment is fun and enjoyable. The work is hard but the coworker are very helpful and like to assist one another. Management is kind and reliable.
PetSmart,1c4nr4k4gakdl9c9,4.0,Petsmart takes good care of their employees. They're always willing to work with you and make an effort for the customers. In the salons they truly care about the animals and love what they do.
PetSmart,1c4nf99jhb89vc1g,3.0,"The PetsHotel was a great job that was always fun. Management only cares about money and business. they are great with working around other jobs or school. If you aren't full time, they can't always guarantee you hours... if you're looking for an easy part time job, this is for you, but don't be expected to be treated like a human being. Also, they pay just above minimum wage and you can make way more at a lot of other places."
PetSmart,1c4n6cvdiakhoak8,2.0,Ever since the company was bought out the Culture has went down. The Plans were not achievable and we had no help from corporate. Every week there was someone new there and they had no idea how to do there job...

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1c4n5nlj25ndk82d,3.0,It can get busy and hectic at times but with awesome teamwork things tend to go smoothly the majority of the time. You will gain knowledge on different animals and how to take care of them properly.
PetSmart,1c4mt5f845ndk9lo,4.0,"work on your duties the moment you start working. help out customers with their pets. I learned a lot about different breeds of animals. learned a lot about different brands of food for certain breed. management were ok, but not on point when it comes to raises. the work culture is friendly and relaxing. the hardest day at work was not to be able to find what product a customer ask for, or seeing a sick animal. a good day at work is when the pet parent is happy when helped with and a happy pet and also accomplished on your duties."
PetSmart,1c4lfgnudakhoe7n,5.0,"Working with animals is always rewarding, and PetSmart does a great job of giving back to the community and working with local shelters.  I had a wonderful experience working in the salon and had the privilege of  woking under a wonderful management staff."
PetSmart,1c4lc8e1dakdlffv,4.0,"PetSmart was a wonderful experience and I made many connections with our customers as well as the animals, and my coworkers. Like any retail job, it can get stressful but my experience was a wonderful one."
PetSmart,1c4l88mheaqhpdns,3.0,This company was alright to work for. They were a relaxed environment with basic retail expectations. However they did not pay very well and the raise options were minimal at best
PetSmart,1c4l6243rb89rc7p,3.0,Overall I got to learn and experience a whole new culture. The environment was welcoming and company lived up to their motto. The managers were really friendly and loving to all animals. Maintenance is always neat and safe for every customer and pet. As a pet owner i approve of company and know my pet will be safe at all times.
PetSmart,1c4l4juhtb81ud2r,2.0,This job was a decent place to work for. Fun environment around animals and working in all departments. They definitely use you for everything they need help with.
PetSmart,1c4knl8j9aqhpbgg,4.0,Good opportunity for single folk. Work life balance is not conducive to family life .
PetSmart,1c4khhi6lakdlc7n,4.0,It was a good company. I only left to work somewhere else.I liked training the dogs and the customers were great. I had a good managerial staff. I was a good experience. I would go back and work there again.
PetSmart,1c4j9qlb8b89rf2q,4.0,"I like the people I work with. The store managers are great and easy to get along with. They let you know if your doing a good job ,which keeps the morally up!"
PetSmart,1c4ij2cht5ndkab6,1.0,"It was like being in school all over again. No matter how good you are it was never enough. Very unprofessional managers, managers that didn't know how to do their job. Very obvious favoritism,  same handful of ppl cross trained on numerous positions over more qualified people. No chance to go to other positions, departments or shifts unless you were a favorite. Open door policy a joke. Insurance was horrible,  never paid for anything. They don't care about employees,  everyone is replaceable and they do it frequently. And they have made it almost impossible to get the monthly bonus. They keep raising the numbers you need to hit."
PetSmart,1c4ic8n3c5j5kf2l,5.0,I enjoyed working with my co-workers and the pets. I helped mostly at the cash register. I helped occasionally with the overnight trucks that came in and helped stock and relabel the shelves. I helped customers out in the best way I could and would find someone to help us if I was unable to answer their question.
PetSmart,1c4iaqjs0b81udv4,3.0,I loved the clients and employees and management. The thing that was hard to deal with was being controlled by corporate. To high of standards without them having the knowledge of what it is like to work in the environment that we worked in.
PetSmart,1c4hrhrq652tocf5,4.0,Working here has been great! Love all the people and pets here. Everyone is super nice and the customers are absolutely great! I would suggest working here to anyone.
PetSmart,1c4gmveo0ak5n8o6,3.0,some people who come in are rude but thats retail. the animals are great but we do the dirty work. not for the squeamish. i love the customers mindset on animals. we all had that one thing in common.
PetSmart,1c4gbga7cb85m8eo,5.0,"If you love dogs, this is the place for you. You get to interact with every kind of dog and truly can show your passion and enthusiasm for animals."
PetSmart,1c4g6rvpuak5nek2,1.0,This was my dream job and the store I was located at ruined that for me. I have a passion for animals but the coworkers and all management but 1 were terrible people. Very rude only cared about money not the employees or the animals. Caused multiple people to be hospitalized or physically sick because of the stress to bring in more money even though we could not force customers to buy products.
PetSmart,1c4fjdrh4aqhkbj0,4.0,"All I did was take care of cute dogs and get paid for it. Sometimes the dogs sucked, but you always find a couple and become best friends with them. It was great."
PetSmart,1c4fasvj95j5f91t,3.0,"PetSmart is a fun place to work if you have a love for animals,  It;s one of the few jobs where playing with puppies and kittens and other animals is a daily occurance.  The work itself can be mind numbingly boring to downright stressful."
PetSmart,1c4er5btl9rd88nv,5.0,"I being born and raised in the USA I love animals. For me this job was fun, never a dull moment. I met hundreds of animals and being a manager had its benefits."

PetSmart,1c4dgq4sdb81ob9h,3.0,"Good company that changes based on senior leadership. Great previous leadership, poor now. Wish things would go back to how they were, but it is what it is."
PetSmart,1c4dbpi2v5ndg8cn,5.0,Overall a great learning experience as far as working with animals . And learning customer service . As well as learning to deal with difficult situations
PetSmart,1c4a847f9ak9r8gc,2.0,"The constant pressure to meet quotas, sell puppy guides, and harass people for email capture makes an already stressful job even worse. Management is extremely hit or miss, with most managers more interested in having good numbers rather than actually keeping employees and store animals happy and healthy."
PetSmart,1c48hj3apaqhkbe2,3.0,Petsmart is a great place to work for pet lovers. There are a lot of activities in the store that allow pet parents to come and socialize. Working at Petsmart has given me greater knowledge of the best pet products for our customers.
PetSmart,1c47c68bj5j5fanr,2.0,But once that is done get out fast and find somewhere private to work. The whole fish bowl zoo animal type atmosphere drove me crazy with people watching me through the glass on the regular.
PetSmart,1c46k1gjob81o8ph,4.0,My team at PetSmart felt like a family. Tight knight and supportive.  I didn't like working with cats that were up for adoption. Broke my heart. Would have worked there for years if I didn't have to move.
PetSmart,1c46ha9mob85m9ao,3.0,This place is not that bad to work at plenty of awesome dogs that come in to brighten up your day. Management was good and hours were no that bad either.
PetSmart,1c46fjseb5n9gfop,5.0,Work life balance and pay were both optimal at Petsmart.  The responsibilities were fair and I rarely felt stressed to get my work done.  The culture was strong.  I enjoyed my coworkers.
PetSmart,1c467id8sakhjdlf,2.0,I have been with the company for some years. You can't move up in the company. They change rules every other day. Management shows to much favoritism. The turnover rate is horable.
PetSmart,1c462bddpb85me84,5.0,I love working with animals and they give you the opportunity to work with them and get paid for it! It's a dream come true. Everyone there are super nice too.
PetSmart,1c45vaimqak5na1t,5.0,"as a bather i had so much fun working there, just be prepared to get soaked in soap and water and get snapped at a few times. its a great work environment when you have the right people working around you"
PetSmart,1c45tbmps52tkdg6,4.0,Drive a pallet rider around pick orders that are sometimes very large and difficult you have to make certain times or you get in trouble you also have to have neat stacked pallets that meet requirements in certain times or you get in trouble
PetSmart,1c45t5m41b85m9kb,4.0,"a typical day is watching up to 15 dogs in a room with toys and play equipment, checking dogs in and out of the hotel going over any precautions with the pet parents, ensuring the safety of the pets under our care is the best for the pets well being. I learned how to read dogs behaviors and quirks and what to look for when a dog becomes scared or threatened. I enjoyed getting to know and see so many different breeds of dogs daily, they all have their own temperament and moods. The hardest part was having several high energy dogs at one time in the room, who all want to rough house. Management was very high strung and expected a lot out of the associates and for us to make little or no mistakes. The workplace was very loud and constantly was cleaned daily using watchdog (non toxic) to animals and humans, it was very fast paced and constantly left you on your toes."
PetSmart,1c45skjhebrdib0s,1.0,taking calls from customers to set up boarding reservations.  poor management - no coaching to help you reach goals which can not be reached because other reps and hotel employees can delete what you do..
PetSmart,1c45j7buf5n9gfle,4.0,Working at PetSmart has provided me with the knowledge of how to work in retail. I was working with many hard working employers who made my job much more successful .
PetSmart,1c45iojf55n9g9il,5.0,As a new groomer you can’t beat Petsmart.  It’s very rare to find any retail company that offers the benefits that Petsmart provides.  You can actually support a family as a Petsmart groomer
PetSmart,1c45h904r5n9gbel,5.0,hey
PetSmart,1c45ef0ecb85mfjc,3.0,"a typical day at work does require a lot of patience. You start off by setting up feeding carts and going around to each reptile/small animal/ and bird habitat and properly making sure everyone has fresh food, water and bedding. after taking care of the animals on the floor, you go into the backroom called ISO and new arrivals. ISO animals need the most TLC with all of their medications and keeping up with vet appointments. the new arrival room is room full of new animals that need to stay isolated for a few days and then sent out to the floor. then you take care of the fish, feeding them and scrubbing tanks."
PetSmart,1c45bvimmb85ma1v,5.0,its a fun and very educational job to be apart of !

PetSmart,1c438vgonakhh862,3.0,the place had a nice environment. Management could use some work. I loved working with the animals. A typical day involved dealing with moody managers.
PetSmart,1c42vk8chak9p80a,2.0,Not for everyone and if you choose to do this type of career it's best you invest in your self with experience before jumping into this. This is a fun.
PetSmart,1c42qsnmfakhhbaa,5.0,"loved it loved working with the animals but had to relocate to another county and I went back to school... I learned a lot about birds, reptiles, mammals, and fish and exactly what fresh fruit they all eat and need I even learned how to clip bird wings scary at first but a breeze when you learn."
PetSmart,1c42ptsf55n9eaav,4.0,expect you to do your job and stay on task. I learned teamwork and good work ethic. Management let us know what was going on week to week and what was expected from us.
PetSmart,1c42mmt2gb81mcg0,3.0,"typical day was clocking in and start my cashier posistion, helping customers hardest part was my commute, live in lincoln, worked in sacramento, they refused to relocate me"
PetSmart,1c428scre52ti833,1.0,"Most of my staff was overly passive aggressive (come on, we are adults), shady, & overall childlike. I ended up QUITTING over the phone because the STORE MANAGER could not be direct with me about an issue & kept beating around the bush. If I wanted to deal with immature people, I’d go sit around a bunch of children. Poor management. A lot of the staff needs coaching on how to deal with people in the workplace."
PetSmart,1c41q8u0abrdfb37,4.0,"Basically it was all about providing the best customer service, with a smile.  An informative interaction in a reasonable time frame with compassion for the cause.  90% of the Leaders were outstanding. It was a place where you felt at home and you belonged."
PetSmart,1c41ior3lakhhaaj,4.0,"I loved working with my pet parents and their dog, they brought light onto my day. There is just no movement to a higher positio though this company, I cross trained in petcare and became#1 in puppy guide sales. I have the highest email capture at 47%."
PetSmart,1c41fl5sk5j5dd1i,2.0,"Not a fun place to work. Extremely stressful, high turnover rate for managers and employees alike. Tense work environments, groomers are paid fairly for their haircuts and commission possibilities but are not compensated or assisted with the other tasks we are expected to perform such as reception work and checking in other peoples clients and walk-in services, which take up considerable amounts of time. Benefits are expensive but very good."
PetSmart,1c413k1d852tic2d,4.0,Its a really great second job! I've been there for over a year and half and things have been pretty great! Every company has its issues but I've enjoyed working there!
PetSmart,1c411nruiakhh96i,4.0,A typical day at work is usually slow and then it will get fast and slow down there’s a lot of dogs and dog toys that kids mess with but it’s a laid back to work at
PetSmart,1c41162o352ti8ie,4.0,"Much different than working at a private company, much more fairness and equality in availability of work and how many animals you groom, would definitely continue to work for them"
PetSmart,1c40qtgbd52tif1d,4.0,"This was my first actual job so I had a couple issues with understanding how things worked.  Otherwise it was an interesting and fun place to work.

PetSmart,1c40ihhbiakhhe87,5.0,Pet Smart was a great company to work for i loved it. I loved being able to work with all of the various types of animals that went into the store each day.
PetSmart,1c40dsfhaakhhb6q,3.0,Most people who work here either are just too comfortable to leave or make enough money to justify it (a.k.a store managers). Also they have way too few employees working on the floor.
PetSmart,1c3vth5dmak5kdd7,3.0,"The dogs and animals in general make Petsmart a great place to work.  My co-worker are very nice and most of the Pet parents that shop in the store.  However, I often joke that the people mess up the store more than the dogs.  And, for some reason, they think we are there to clean up after their dogs.  We provide Oops stations for them to use to clean up dog waste.  But, often get attitude from customers when we politely tell them to do so."
PetSmart,1c3vphatl5n9ea32,2.0,What I love most about PetSmart is that employees definitely have a work/life balance.
PetSmart,1c3uo2g4uak5kf9r,4.0,I work in the grooming salon and it is so relaxed and everyone gets along well. The manager is very understanding when you need certain days off and tries to work with what you need. You can be bit a lot by the dogs. I dont get many hours because I am just a pet stylist apprentice (bather)
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

PetSmart,1c3umpbdkak9oav2,4.0,cool and stuff. Love it and really enjoy who I work with. I don't understand why this is even needed. Why do I need to write a review about my current job for?
PetSmart,1c3u8gdsjak5fac0,4.0,"I really love working for this company, I have been able to transfer to 3 different stores and my original store is always willing to take me back. The only thing I do not like is the up sales they want you to do at the register, puppy guides, training, donations, etc. It just gets to be too much at times. And when you work in the store the only full time employees are the managers, most time I average 15- 30 hours a week ( on a good week)."
PetSmart,1c3tf5mbsakhcb1n,3.0,"3 years ago PetSmart was a wonderful place to work. Management wanted associates' opinions and was very easy to work for and laid back. Since then the place has done a 180 as far as changing management, policies, rules and discipline. Everything about the job became more difficult physically and emotionally. Most of the good qualities of the job either came with consequences or were removed. Supervisors went from experienced and collaborative to inexperienced and don't ask questions."
PetSmart,1c3s4jqhgbrdda9f,5.0,Great management that is flexible with work hours. The team works together to make sure all pet parents needs are completed. I would recommend this work to anyone who loves animals.
PetSmart,1c3rm8e1ibrddf8s,5.0,"I work with great people under great management. We take care of any animals that walk through our doors and of all of the animals, fish, and accessories that we sell."
PetSmart,1c3r8hlcjakd9dsq,3.0,"For my petsmart, a lot of the regular workers were lazy so when I would do work it would just really pi** me off that we made the same pay. There were like 4 managers when I started and a lot of them change store locations but I don’t really have a problem other than the occasional attitude. It’s a nice work environment in general, but staying at the cash register for 7+ hours is super draining and annoying."
PetSmart,1c3qnuofgakhc8l4,2.0,"If you love pets, this is the place to work. Unfortunately all else pretty much matches that of a retail work setting. Compensation is not good, management is very unmotivated, and customers treat employees very poorly."
PetSmart,1c3pju3slb89dc9s,3.0,"I have learned so much working here from shoppers behaviors to animal care. Most customers are nice and friendly however you will always have those jerks that come in, which is normal. Don't ever expect management to have your back though, all they care about is making a sale, I have a suspicion that they make bonuses from certain sales which is why they push it so hard. They push it so hard that it is almost a threat to the employees which can make it a really stressful environment to work in. However the rest of the lower level employees are all very friendly and nice. There are some managers that are genuinely nice. however those managers receive backlash from other managers. All of this is just at my store. I have been to other stores and employees there look even more miserable than I do when I'm at work, and I'm not the only one that notices it."
PetSmart,1c3pfs55cb85f9n8,2.0,when a customer was rude management left me by myself to get yelled at. management was hardly ever available to answer my questions. Too many contradictions in policies.
PetSmart,1c3p42i00aqhccbd,4.0,"I have learned to communicate with customers in a more professional way, and taking care of the animals. I loved making sure everyone was happy and the animals were well taken care of."
PetSmart,1c3ot92deaqhcbce,3.0,"Very Stressful and fast paced you must be able to manage your time wisely and not cut corners. I've learned how to manage my time better. The management is terrible, there is a major lack of communications between departments and their expectations are unreasonably high for the department I was in. The hardest part was keeping up with the higher ups whims on what they wanted you to sell next while trying to get all your work done and dogs bathed. The most enjoyable part was the animals and interaction between them and the customers. Transforming animals and developing a close relationship with customers."
PetSmart,1c3oopl885nd7fgi,2.0,"I worked for pet smart for 2 years, Store managers could care less for the pets in their store all they see is money. There is no room for advancement due to stores not making sales or doing too well. Employees are paid poorly and the turn over rate at the stores are 60/100. They are not very flexible or understanding and refuse to hire anyone in school and so they do not have to deal with unemployment they will attempt to flush you out."
PetSmart,1c3nep3piaqhcbpb,5.0,When i started at Pet smart i knew very little when it came o the overall care for different animals. I was really easy to pick up good per care puts from coworks and even customers taught me a lot. Great place to work while attending school. They always were good about working around my schedule
PetSmart,1c3neojf0ak9jfd5,2.0,"From store manager to shipment manager, and especially the salon Manager there is no order and sense of loyalty and everyone plays everyone, making job security scarce. Dogs could bite you and you don't file paper work unless life threatening, but dogs or cats fall or soil themselves and they instantly believe you did something. DO NOT work in the salon what so ever here."
PetSmart,1c3n6scesak9jf29,5.0,A love for animals and lack of fear is necessary. It is a dirty job but well worth it due to the many cute animals you get to play with and you really learn a lot about dog behavior.
PetSmart,1c3mugtvqb89dbio,5.0,Great place to work part time and excellent full time benefits. The hours can be long sometimes and tiring but its a rewarding position that I highly recommend.
PetSmart,1c3m8hdvsaqhc8gm,4.0,"PetSmart was a very good job to me, they always treated their workers with respect and we worked as a team to accomplish big goals. I didn't have to ask my coworkers for help with very many things, but when I did they were always very helpful with me."
PetSmart,1c3m74sltb89d846,1.0,"During my employment at the Lincoln CA store my mother had been struck by a train. while i was employed i was devastated by the accident and i was given 2 weeks for grievance which was non paid even though i was a full time employee. The 2 weeks i had was not nearly enough time to get organized... between family gatherings and funerals, it was a nightmare. After letting my management know that i cannot come back in 2 weeks but will come back a little time after everything had settled, the management decided to let me go but had stated i could come back after everything was completed (which was fine). When i tried to go back to a company, i spent YEARS with as a outstanding employee, i was deemed (non-hire-able). After months of asking to be rehired i had to call corporate to reverse the non-rehire status. when calling back to the Santa Cruz store i was told ""sorry, but your not hire-able, thanks bye""..... (WITHOUT EXPLANATION). i was once again devastated, knowing all the time i have spent with the company to be thrown out like garbage, I was a FANTASTIC employee. Just shows you how much the company cares about their employees... i loved my job. The store in Santa Cruz does not have an assistant manager with positions open, as a former employee i know the ends and outs and know what must be done, after a couple of days someone answered the phone and said there was no position. Poor customer service quality and a loss of a great Employee, thanks pet-smart for treating me with little respect as this whole outcome reflects on your overall scores."
PetSmart,1c3m23324ak5ff5v,5.0,I had a lot of fun working here. I love Animals and was able to interact with them regularly and get to know some of them and their owners. I had to leave them because i moved and would work for them again if i was able to make a bit more. Glad i picked this place to gain my workplace experience.
PetSmart,1c3lvd8qmakd9a87,4.0,"It's okay. Dogs are great to be around, typical customers, but management on all levels is not up to par. The tech is old or not efficient. Sort of a high turn over rate."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.

PetSmart,1c3hj162ib857bf6,5.0,"Always happy with the different managers I worked with. Flexible hours and VERY accommodating to work schedules. Excellent benefits. Pay could have been a little bit better, especially for managers."
PetSmart,1c3hicu9ab818eb5,5.0,Loved working at PetSmart. Even with difficult management it was well worth it. Cross-trained through the hotel and store. Cross-trained for front and back of hotel. Learned a lot of new information.
PetSmart,1c3ha0la1brd28gg,4.0,"Pretty efficient management, Corporate seems very greedy though and that effects the very important associate/customer relationship. Low level management is awesome, Corporate management places money over customer satisfaction."
PetSmart,1c3h5959652t3f10,3.0,"Terrible work schedule, managers unwilling to work with your schedule and act like they are doing you a favor to answer questions. Only positive was that you get a small discount."
PetSmart,1c3h08m8uakd4eop,3.0,"Very reluctant to give raises, no two people are paid the same for the same job, and you are not allowed to discuss your pay with your co-workers."
PetSmart,1c3gkdmoqb85789l,5.0,I loved working at petsmart because I got to be around animals. I was a amazing experience to get to work there. I enjoyed working everyday and the work place is such a fun and comfortable place to be at.
PetSmart,1c3g3jdjf9rcu8hf,3.0,I worked here for a year and i really enjoyed working with the animals. Coming from germany I found the living expectations for the animals very very underwhelming.
PetSmart,1c3f68hkm5nd29pt,3.0,My experience was pretty average. It had ups and downs. Some days were enjoyable because I got a lot done. On other days I could not get hardly anything done because the store was busy.
PetSmart,1c3enm0irak9ecbp,4.0,"Overall it was a fun place to work, especially if you love animals. Corporate has made it so that each store is severely understaffed though and this made it very stressful for every associate."
PetSmart,1c3engt43ak9eb64,4.0,A typical day at work can vary depending on when and what is on your schedule. You are definitely more fast paced around holidays and summer. It will also depend on how many dogs you groom within a shift.
PetSmart,1c3eanvd9aqh6dov,1.0,The work environment is despicable for the employees. Bad management.  Employees does not really care for the pets. Pet owners drop their pets thinking they will be taking care off but it is not the case.
PetSmart,1c3dsjjt8akh7eiq,4.0,You had a set schedule. Didn’t have to be called in if someone didn’t show up to work. Pay was good plus you got paid every week. Paid vacation and paid sick days
PetSmart,1c3dqtakk5nd2cu3,4.0,Loved my job.  Would still be there if they had not relocated to Pennsylvania. Management was fair and wages were decent.  Home life and work was balanced.
PetSmart,1c3ct90c85nd2c9f,3.0,"The hours were low, along with the pay. Management was unsupported and employees treated unfairly. Bullying occurred occasionally, and the store is filthy."
PetSmart,1c3c4pmrab894dt9,4.0,can set your schedule but hard to switch shift/get time off sometimes.  still retail  but overall better customers and work environment. minimum wage with ok raises
PetSmart,1c3c4abqnbrcraon,2.0,"While working in the PetsHotel,it became  the dogs were not treated correctly and it seems that everyone was so caught up in drama and creating divisions between people. Head manager of the Hotel Trelawny seems to be the only manager worthy of her position. I received threats and had horrible things said to me by all the other managers, specifically the store manager and assistant hotel leader. I got along well with the majority of my co workers, but we all felt the same way. They never stuck to hours, some weeks I'd be lucky to get 5 hours, the next they would have me working overtime up to 30 hours. Communication was really lacking also, it was hard to leave because I had become close to the regular pets and pet parents, but ultimately the treatment of pets and employees grew too bad."
PetSmart,1c3c46oeu5ncq9va,3.0,"As a cashier,. It was non stop.  Hard to get breaks because there was no one to cover you half the time.   GREAT  people  to work with and for.  Training was very minimal."
PetSmart,1c3c3fbrd5ncq8k6,3.0,"I don't have any comments. I don't have anything to say really about the company. If you love animals then go work there. If you are looking for your first job, then go apply."

PetSmart,1c3bsspa4b894b64,4.0,"If you are an animal lover, pet smart creates multiple oppurtunitys for employment beyond cashier. Veterinarian experience, shelters for adoptions and care for multiple species"
PetSmart,1c3blspacb8159ki,5.0,Overall this was a great place to work and very fun. People were always friendly and seemed to have fun and make the work place less stressful and a place that people would want to work.
PetSmart,1c3bl1748b853a4p,5.0,"Petsmart is a wonderful place to work and I would recommend it to anyone looking for work. The pay isn't great, but the management is amazing and helpful and are willing to teach you new skills."
PetSmart,1c3bb3e3pak95ded,5.0,"Most of the days, we had stuff to do so the days were never boring. Working with the pets was really fun. Most of the customers were friendly and loved to have conversations with us employees."
PetSmart,1c3a06f4nb815dq1,3.0,"Petsmart is a quick paced job and not for the average bear. You must have the ability to multitask, have initiative, and be thick skinned. It is NOT for those who want to just play with puppies. If you stick through the hard, its very rewarding."
PetSmart,1c39sd8vo52sr99p,4.0,The only reason I left was because of new management not caring enough about the animals. I would have worked here for much longer if my old manager had stayed. Really awesome taking care of the animals and connecting with customers and their pets.
PetSmart,1c39heds152srdhm,3.0,Loved the people i worked with and the animals. But corporate was very pushy. You make your sales and its still not good enough. Used to care about employees and pets but now they just care about sales
PetSmart,1c393r4fk52srf8p,4.0,"Maybe different locations differ, but this location in particular is not a good place if you're trying to move up in life."
PetSmart,1c37cq1e2b853ckh,4.0,"Working with dogs has been an incredibly rewarding, but challenging experience. The diversity of the species allowed me to learn many things about the breed. As all living things do, dogs go to the bathroom, which sometimes left me leaving work smelling a bit worse than I wanted. The direct management in the PetsHotel I worked for seemed to play favorites, which left me feeling left out and under-appreciated."
PetSmart,1c372h1vub8539bg,3.0,"PetSmart is like any customer service job, it sucks but it has its perks like discounts and cool people to work with. Management is poor and corporate sucks. They don’t pay their people enough and don’t give long term employees chances to advance, they usually just hire someone else. They don’t really care unless they’re making money. They cut back on people’s hours and then wonder why things don’t get done. Poor communication."
PetSmart,1c36rk3uh5j4qdi2,3.0,It was a good job. I enjoyed working there and helping the pet parents get everything they needed. Asst.mgr and I didn't see eye to eye and I figured it was best for both of us if I left.
PetSmart,1c36od7soakgvfvl,5.0,Petsmart is constantly busy so you are never left without anything to do. The customers are pleasant and you get to work with small animals everyday if you are a Pet Care Associate.
PetSmart,1c36lc3coakgvap3,5.0,"While employed at Petsmart, I was able to develop my customer service skills along with getting to know the community and their pets on a larger scale. Daily tasks would include:"

PetSmart,1c36feg63aqh2e8t,1.0,"Recommend not working there. It's not a good place, some of the managers are okay but only one isn't. She's very rude. Don't get paid enough for what they ask."
PetSmart,1c36f60ih5ncqcei,4.0,it was fun to work with people and educate the on pet care and health of the pets. the leads and managers were always nice and understanding. the coworkers are very helpful
PetSmart,1c34v5pou5n8qc8b,3.0,"lack of communication between managments to coreworkers. Due to the lack of communication , created high tensions which would make it stressful to work at times."
PetSmart,1c34qo85sakcsfvj,2.0,"Company is great to work for. They give plenty of vacation and sick days to employees(full time and part time) and give full benefits, and are flexible with hours and requests off. Management however is a different story. Managers would regularly not show up for shifts, or were late. Employees were given preferential treatment and there was zero accountability with employees. With the right management I would highly recommend petsmart"
PetSmart,1c34ppu9vak95cc6,4.0,"Take care of animals, educate people how to take care of pets, cashier responsibilities , customer service , money handling, stocking and closing procedures"

PetSmart,1c3455ir9b8538eq,3.0,Definitely not a place to stay for a long time. Grooming destroys your body. CORE associates are under alot of pressure as well. Overall i had a fun team minus a few people but it really is a hit or a miss per store.
PetSmart,1c33rpcte52sregc,4.0,"If I could have I would have stayed at this job. The hours were long and the job was extremely hard, but the pay was worth it. I worked at night si it made it difficult to continue to work there."
PetSmart,1c33qna88ak50bei,1.0,no communication from shift to shift. employees set other employees up for trouble. My own manager would be vulgar and talk nasty about my other co-workers to employees under her. Anything confided in my manager regarding problems with other employees was not handled professionally. My manager would just go to the person I was complaining about and tell them I was complaining about them. Lots of hostility due to this. My manager finds anyway possible to avoid and talk to me now. very uncomfortable work place. Manager above my personal manager
PetSmart,1c325fnvob812fui,4.0,"I really enjoyed my time working with Petsmart, I always liked the fact that I can always pet a dog or cat when I am having a horrible day.  I was promoted quickly through this company and found it to be quite competitive - which was fun for me.  I quickly saw advancement and the only reason I left the company was because I ended up dating a co-worker, and could not get a transfer for my position so I left the company."
PetSmart,1c3212jp9ak50bu2,3.0,A typical day at work can be very unpredictable. The atmosphere is very much set upon the managers and how they are feeling. I loved working there at the beginning however slowly decreased in my desire to work there.
PetSmart,1c31urja2akgvaff,5.0,Learned more about pet products. I had a great team where we would be able to help each other with information any of the team members did not know and we would learn as a team to help our costumers choose the best items for their pets.
PetSmart,1c31rl2qrb812c03,3.0,"this job was a fun one to work with different kinds of pets but not have to take any of them home. i started as a pet care associate and did a lot of time wasting when it was slow. most of the chores are done in the first hour of your shift or the last hour, otherwise its keeping busy with customer service and stocking shelves. lots of pet parents had lots of questions, but when you try and answer them, they interrupt you because they think they know something. i was then promoted to the only dog trainer in the store. that was stressfull. i had the store manager always breathing down my neck making sure i had control of my department ( which was just me). i trained dogs for a year and asked to move up to an assistant manager job but they wouldnt give it to me. i got tired of the same drama everyday and left"
PetSmart,1c31nfmvpb88u8f9,5.0,"PetSmart was the best company I had ever worked for.  They were fair in their dealings and always concerned about not only employees, but animals as well."
PetSmart,1c2vc9v4eaqh2e2o,4.0,I loved to take care of the animals everyday and night. Helping people find the right pet to get and the correct products to maintain the health of there pets. Management was very fair and fun to work with.
PetSmart,1c2v607sgaqh2b2v,5.0,I loved working for petsmart and it was the best job I have ever had. The staff was amazing and I actually looked forward to going to to work every day.
PetSmart,1c2ut7vcrb88ufue,3.0,"Love the interaction of the dogs but disapprove of the policy of being pressured to cut so many dogs in one day. Its a stress hazard fro you and the dog., Many of the haircuts we did there were necessary to keep the day flowing. We did not have time to demat or untangle dogs coat due to time constraint. I hated that!!"
PetSmart,1c2ur0fs5ak92eu8,5.0,volunteered for a few years with the animal adoption events at Petsmart. they were great and we were able to find good homes for many animals. I took care of the animals and assisted staff.
PetSmart,1c2un3rtbak50aot,4.0,"I honestly love my job, but with the hours I get they aren't enough to make a living. I would like to gain another part-time job to even out my paychecks and being able to make sure I can pay my bills. The hardest part of the job would have to be time, You have a lot of things to do throughout the day and some of those are stressful. Work culture is great besides some of those who I work with don't seem very into their jobs, I wish they were more upbeat about it. Management is alright but I don't feel that they really hear what you are saying and don't have a clear mind when talking to employees. A typical day at work is answering phone calls and making appointments, bathing/drying, clipping nails, brushing, teeth brushing, etc to dogs in my care under appointments. Finally, the most enjoyable part of my job is helping those around me and getting to make dogs more beautiful then they were before. My overall rating for PetSmart is that it is a decent place to work, just not if you want more then 20 hours or less a week."
PetSmart,1c2tcngoub853bdr,4.0,"Took care of dogs all day, played with them and watched over them while their owners were at work/vacation/etc. Cleaned kennels, gave medicine, fed and provided water."
PetSmart,1c2svldg7aqh2avk,3.0,"Store Manager with 10+ years of experience.  Typical retail environment.  Tough home, work balance, and they always expect you to do more with less.  Pay was above average from an industry perspective though and benefits were OK, not great, especially medical, high deductibles and premiums."
PetSmart,1c2smmnt5ak929pt,3.0,"I had this job while in college to make extra money. The job itself was exactly what I was told it would be, and I had zero issues with the actual store management. Where I had issues were with the supervisor directly over our department and the way in which he operated. Overall, it would make a great job to teach those just starting in the workforce responsibility and how to begin to manage and balance a work, school, and home life."
PetSmart,1c2si6e5h52sr8t8,4.0,"The petshotel was very fun to work in. My managers and coworkers were very friendly and easy to work with. Unfortunately, the scheduling system was outdated and slow, but it didn't pose much of a problem."

(beardies, snakes, tortoises and chameleons)"
PetSmart,1c2sdaes7ak92b3n,1.0,"This company would be a good place to work for , there need to be a change in management.

PetSmart,1c2s9hqnnak928im,1.0,"Waiting for PetSmart to begin caring about their employees, especially since being sold, has been an exercise in futility. Wages cut, employment strain, and constant threat of termination on ALL levels just to name a few. The employees are amazing but the corporate level keeps everything stressful and uncertain."
PetSmart,1c2s91ogjakgvcsp,2.0,I have been with this company for about 2 years. The management team at my store is horrendous and the higher ups do not seem to care so long as we make profit (which we are not). We are in the business of selling animals and yet our animals and their health seem to be the lowest priority to the management team.
PetSmart,1c2s75jn152srbok,4.0,I worked at Petsmart to get future career skills and training. I am in school for veterinarian medicine. The only reason I did not like this job was because of a bad employee who ruined the workplace for more than just me.
PetSmart,1c2ru5pukak92aou,4.0,"Although my particular store has different store managers frequently, the managers below the store lead are fun, fair, engaging, and actually care. You accumulated vacation time even as a part time and they have tuition reimbursement."
PetSmart,1c2rtenrabrcr8i3,2.0,the company overworks their employees and does not back them during disagreements with customers the management is lesss tan helpful when dealing with employees
PetSmart,1c2qdfcqc5n8qeoq,3.0,"This company does not stand still. Every 6 months they change what is most important and tells everyone to focus on something new just as you get comfortable. Every year the managers in our district would  switch to new stores to ""try and find the perfect combination"" to make the stores more successful. You can have a lot of fun with your coworkers or you can have a lot of stress, it all depends on your management team."
PetSmart,1c2qcg3225ncq84i,1.0,"one of the most awful places to work for I suggest that if you want to work for this company take a look at the management team and see what other employees have to say about their management, it felt like being in high school again with all the drama and everyone didnt work as a team to get tasks accomplished also some of the employees were 2 faced"

PetSmart,1c2q1p7mi52sr9dm,3.0,If you love animals do not work for PetSmart. It's all selling puppy guides and selling the most product as fast as possible. I work 6-7 days a week to get 32 hours. There are no options for moving up or getting more hours. The only full time jobs are management. In my store the managers cannot preform basic petcare and pet care associates get maybe 3 days of training before being dropped into a shift alone.
PetSmart,1c2pug840brcra4k,5.0,"Overall, management is amazing and the group of workers are extremely nice. I didn't get the hours that I was needing, so I had to leave. They are flexible with your school and possibly other work schedules. My fellow coworkers were incredibly nice and taught how to do the job efficiently and took their time teaching me."
PetSmart,1c2pg8k9vakcsd06,5.0,Running the cash register
PetSmart,1c2oovgu6ak50e5k,1.0,Work environment is difficult and dangerous. Schedules and hours are chaotic and unreasonable. Management is political and promotions raises are based on favoritism. I suffered permanent injuries on the job which were not treated or compensated. I was let go and had to sue to get the unemployment benefits I was due. Supervisors are inconsistent and often incompetent.
PetSmart,1c2n625lrak50b9i,2.0,Mornings usually start around 4AM and usually leave after scheduled time off due to strict demands and not enough hands to help finish tasks. Managers are either lazy or overly strict when it is not necessary. PetSmart is making bonuses nearly impossible to obtain and the DM's are requiring so much and not enough time to complete the tasks given. PetSmart does not allow overtime but in order to leave work you are required to complete every task or stay late. If you have plans previously scheduled the manager usually on duty makes you feel terrible for having to leave. I would never recommend PetSmart to any friends or family. Worst company I have ever worked for.
PetSmart,1c2jhb50ub80u8oo,5.0,"Love the animals, great staff would recommend working here. Good opportunity for moving up and many options in which field you can get into. Never a dull moment."

PetSmart,1c2iq0p7e52srb4t,1.0,"When I started it was a privately owned company that was fantastic to work for. Now Petsmart is a conglomerate that does not care about customers, associates, or pets. Everyone is just a dollar sign and nothing else."

PetSmart,1c2idag2u5n8qf09,2.0,"I worked there for almost six years. I was never approached with advancement opportunities, even though I had received corporate commendations several times. I had also asked for a full time position on a few occasions and they were never very willing to work with me on it. We had a couple of leads that weren't interested in advancement, so I was stuck in limbo. I had asked for advancement opportunities or workshops and I was never taken seriously. They almost always hired outside of the company for management, which makes no sense from an integrity stand point. Raises every year were expected to be around 10 cents, if you were lucky, 25 cents."
PetSmart,1c2gp3vofb88ubbp,4.0,"Your love of pets will help you at this job, they are pet oriented, they help pet parents take care of their pets the right way. Very informative on what products they have, Cashiers are super friendly but fast paced. so it might seem they are pushing you through the line but that might only be because the line is long or they are getting heat from their managers. either way they are friendly."
PetSmart,1c2gbedaeas0venq,4.0,"Fun work environment. Great for someone who loves pets. In general, there is enough payroll to complete required tasks. Technology and processes need improvement."
PetSmart,1c2g2bmj8aqgv82p,5.0,This company TRULY cares for their pets and the pet parents.  Completely focused on the needs of each animal/guest.  How can you complain about petting puppies daily?  Love.
PetSmart,1c2fssgq5brcra04,3.0,I loved working at Petsmart because of the animals. It sometimes did get very stressful when watching dogs in large groups in the Pets Hotel because you never knew when a fight would breakout between the dogs. That was really the only downside though.
PetSmart,1c2f6notgakgsbk2,3.0,"Manager did not get the schedule out in a timely manner, constant waves of new staff, lack of communication, a lot of back stabbing when it came to the managers. No breaks, no lunches, constantly doing tasks for other departments."
PetSmart,1c2ev92k15n8qcg5,1.0,"I was falsely promised numerous things such as advancements and raises, and got screwed over by poor management. I often got assigned on mundane tasks, while management in the Wendover location store would sit around all day every shift and gossip amongst each other. while working on my shifts i barely got let go for break to be relieved off register for my breaks mostly because the scheduling manager here would schedule just about every one of my shifts so we were understaffed, and the same managers wouldn't relieve me because they didn't want to be on register. The beginning of this job was great until they brought in horrible micro mangers that were also very lazy, and quiet disrespectful. I got out of this job as soon as i could. NEVER recommending this job to anybody."
PetSmart,1c2etm4cc5n8qc1u,3.0,Difficult to work as a groomer. Very high volume. Difficulties in time management due to at hand tasks being constantly interrupted and very stressful.
PetSmart,1c2essc6i5n8qd3n,4.0,PetSmart is an excellent company to work for with a relatively easygoing atmosphere. Management is quite capable and friendly as well. That being said there could be more chances for advancement in the company on a store level scale.
PetSmart,1c2dkskcg5ncqd4o,5.0,Great job to start off in if going into the animal field has its ups and downs like any company but they take care of their own. All management want to see employees succeed. Great first job!!
PetSmart,1c2dd843bak928fs,5.0,"Petsmart is a great place for young people looking for a job. I loved working there because I am a big dog person and you got to meet a lot of dogs that came through the register line. It was a relaxing company to work for, the management was great."
PetSmart,1c2d6c1utakcsb2h,4.0,I have 2 young children and one week I was scheduled for only 8 hours and the next week only 9 1/2 so I put in my 2 week notice after management wasn't cooperative with me.
PetSmart,1c2cio3e8aqgvdgs,3.0,I worked in the hotel and the job itself is awesome and the people that the company hire are pretty awesome too but the company as a whole is terrible. all they care about is money
PetSmart,1c2cgcr2fb88udnm,5.0,"It was an interesting place, management was lacking when I worked there with customer satisfaction. It was more structured like a high school drama set, which is expected in a younger work environment, but unfortunately they were elders who were the main culprits of spreading unnecessary gossip."
PetSmart,1c2arrv0fb80ubv8,3.0,"Petsmart is a fast pace place to work, downside maybe be company interests over employees."
PetSmart,1c2ab3b6gak50df6,4.0,lots of responsibility with pet care and groomers. Can be stressful with having to care for animals that come in sick and you are responsible for them
PetSmart,1c28b0mh5akgrc3g,1.0,"Will mess u over and over no chances of higher opportunity, constantly lies so much drama and stress , watch what U do people will try and get u fired team members and managers poor poor job"
PetSmart,1c25oqsol5ncpcui,4.0,"This was a great starter job.  I was a pet care specialist.  The only thing that I really have a complaint about was that all of the work wasn't fairly distributed.  Other than that, it was not a hard job, though a lot of work and you learned a lot. The customers were usually pleasant unlike some retail places."
PetSmart,1c22c5vh852sp9d6,4.0,"If you love animals, this is both a wonderful and exhausting job. On the one hand you get to take care of and be around animals, on the other you have to deal with death, and things like customers coming in and being absolutely insane. As an example: During the summer, people will come in with turtles they found outside and want to keep as pets, despite your advice and warnings, will buy a small, plastic carrying container they intend to keep them in."
PetSmart,1c223mud35j4pdc5,1.0,Expected to worked every weekend and holiday (no matter what agreed on during hiring). Worst management ever seen. Extremely cut throat. Work through breaks. Unsafe work environment. They will push you until you break. Also any personal equipment is open for anyone to use and break without and repercussions.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1c1mvglddakgibc6,4.0,very fun loveing job fast pace great first job i would offer every one to apply if they actually hired people cool work culture thank you have a good day
PetSmart,1c1mak2ffak4la27,4.0,"My days were short and early, so the best for the wanting to relax until something else happens. Management is ok, not the best when it comes to being fair. I could not be scheduled for 5 days, and then get a note my next shift when I wasn't there for almost a week. They have too many people or arent smart about how they handle then hours to give people. I would only work truck days, and then when non-truck days are happening they would let some random cashier or someone of another department stock, messing up the neatness on the shelf or mistocking. The enviroment is friendly. If I'm lucky I get to pet an animal or two, or I just get to converse with coworkers for a short while. The hardest part of my job is not getting help for the entire side of the store I have to stock, which was all the dog food bags with weight ranging from 4-lbs-50lbs of food. On average I stocked mostly close to 0.5-1 ton of dog food. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to listen to music while I work."
PetSmart,1c1m0ajnuaqgke31,2.0,Stressful place to be. The management was bad and actual lives depended on you. One time I had to give mouth to mouth to a guinea pig because we weren't cleared to take her to the vet yet.
PetSmart,1c1ltmek90mct1it,5.0,"I like working for PetSmart, my managers are fair and very willing to support me as a trainer. I am starting my first training classes soon, and I am looking forward to it."
PetSmart,1c1lna9gt0mtr3mc,5.0,PetSmart was a great company to start off with. They are a great team and makes sure everything is done properly. They always made sure the job was done correctly and efficiently.
PetSmart,1c1jhfr28ak4l90i,2.0,I would never work there again I didn't not have a good work experience. The company is so much about making money they treat you as a number not as a person. no
PetSmart,1c1jh1rsras0hek3,3.0,"The employees and coworkers are amazing people for the most part. Management can have an issue with undervaluing employees, and the corporate system is not enjoyable to work with as they seem to put money and customers over employee happiness."
PetSmart,1c1icufplakcja13,5.0,"PetSmart is an amazing company, and the location that I got the opportunity to work at was amazing. A typical work day at PetSmart was very busy, but full of fun. I have learned so much here, I've learned how to work with computers, registers, money, and I've learned a lot about social skills. Work culture was always great, coworkers were always nice and positive. There never really was a hard part about this job, management always worked with me and my medical problems to do what was best for me. The most enjoyable part always was how my positivity was so contagious."
PetSmart,1c1hvhihgak4lf9o,4.0,Most recent job and it pays the bills. Long hours but you have a longer weekend than other jobs would give you. As long as you do your job and don't cause drama you will have a job for long-term.
PetSmart,1c1guqkqiakcjdd8,2.0,I decided to take the job to this place due to the fact that I want to be a Vet Assistant. It was the worst idea I ever had. They expect you to do many things in the course of one day and yet the pay isn't worth it.
PetSmart,1c1gcsuki0kbu4f0,3.0,"Petsmart Distribution provided me with great training, good benefits, great hours I really enjoyed this job. Management was good but i do not agree with the policy on firing people for getting into disagreements at the workplace and the investigation protocl."
PetSmart,1c1fs54b20mte578,4.0,"Hard work with a bit of fun, You have the opportunity to interact with not only store animals but also customers.  Management is great the store is smaller scale therefore you will have more than one role."
PetSmart,1c1eab89lakgidvm,1.0,"A typical day included the same tedious routines that never change, even as someone who was new to the job was expected to do it perfectly. I never went through training here either. Management here was awful, they played favorites and if you did not kiss up to them, you aren't going to last very long here. However, you get to meet some pretty cool people, as well as some very strange ones via the clientele. The workplace is very disorganized and that was the hardest part to this job in all honesty."
PetSmart,1c1e7l7puakgifgt,4.0,"Overall, PetSmart is not a bad place to work. As a cashier the job is pretty easy and laid back. Pet Care is a little more stressful, but for the most part it isn't too difficult as long as you have a decent amount of knowledge on the variety of animals in the store (if you don't, you'll learn as you go). However, they aren't so great at giving raises or moving people up in the store, so if you're hired as a cashier chances are you're going to be stuck as a cashier or be given the opportunity to move into the grooming salon as a bather."
PetSmart,1c1dqh1veb88lfu1,5.0,"I started in the specialty department. With the fish, birds, and reptiles. After a while, customers would ask for me by name and tell me what was going with their pets and I always knew what to recommend so they could be healthy again. I was then trained as a dog trainer and everyone loved my classes and would just come in and want to sign up. Even if I had not tried to sell them a class."
PetSmart,1c1dpm0etak8mfdj,3.0,management not helpful or supportive
PetSmart,1c1c4b6n4aqgkaun,3.0,"overall a good place to work. The people were nice, management was professional and trained well. The benefits were nice. They were flexible with hours."
PetSmart,1c1bv9milb88hbrp,3.0,"This was a fast paced customer service that handled inbound calls for the hotels , and grooming services. One of the easiest jobs I have ever had. When management changed incentives changed and was very hard to adjust to lower incentives but metrics expected to be increased . Change was probably hardest part of this job"
PetSmart,1c1blhcb90kbu0uc,3.0,Fast pace environment. Lots of pets everywhere. If your an animal lover than its perfect for you. They care a lot about helping pets and contribute a lot.
PetSmart,1c1big2unakcg9sq,5.0,petsmart was a great job no complaints i enjoyed grooming pets i enjoyed meeting new people...speaking to the clients about there pets and ordering supplies
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1c13o36ka0kbl727,3.0,The PetSmart I worked at tended to over work their good employees and just let the lesser ones slide. The newest manager chose favorites and bad mouth those he did not care for.
PetSmart,1c13ldr8n1d1509m,5.0,"Petsmart treats its employees exceptionally well, employee sales that include items that have been discontinued or unsold clearance for very minimal prices, great benefits, and great environment. The supervisors and trainers were very encouraging and let us know that even though we couldn't reach production, we would be a great fit within the company. The problem with that is that most, if not all, of the other departments only hire from within. If you can't make it in shipping, you basically don't get to work for the company these days."
PetSmart,1c13cns4g0kbl725,2.0,"Low hours, poor management, open door policy was not true, dangerous workplace, over worked and underpaid, best part of working there was seeing the animals everyday, managers don’t back you up with customer complaints"
PetSmart,1c11ot5a71ai447r,5.0,"I enjoyed working with this company, they help my animal handling skills grow exponentially. My co-workers made it enjoyable to come to work and made the day go by easily. I regret having to leave the store I have become so attached too."
PetSmart,1c11g09pv5na0e89,5.0,You become a family with the employees and you really get to know the customers and their pets. You also get to learn a lot of new stuff dealing with animals
PetSmart,1c112rioeakhpdht,4.0,I love animals and loved working here.  I worked as a team leader in the specialty department (pet care and sales) so I took care of all types of animals.   The best part was learning to hand feed a cockatoo who came to store so young that he didn't know how to feed himself.  The training and knowledge gained about animals is phenomenal.  The other great part is dealing with families and kids as they come to get an addition to their family.  The kids are cute and so excited and it great to teach them new things and get updates on animals you may have helped raise.  Now the hard part is it can be a dirty job as you will have to clean up a lot of messy situations and sometimes properly dispose of animals that have died due to injuries or just age.  Occasionally you will also have to deal with families that are neglecting or hurting animals and get with your manager to intervene.
PetSmart,1c0v3jek0b860b8v,5.0,I left to pursue a career at a veterinary office and I also care for my elderly disabled parents. I was willing to do both but could not meet the needs of my employer.
PetSmart,1c0uqqfrj1d031h6,3.0,I learned a lot form pet smart I intend to keep learning more as my career progresses in life. Pet smart had a healthy environment and open door policy made it easier.
PetSmart,1c0un6d0e52tq8ue,4.0,Not a bad place to work but you must have a love for animals you do have to pick up after the customers pets that they come in and shop with the pets but overall the people are nice the workers are nice nicer place to shop than to work
PetSmart,1c0ua4bbj5j5l818,3.0,"It is a good place to work, if you enjoy working with animals.    But there is little opportunity for advancement.   a lot of favoritism from management."
PetSmart,1c0u9pkk3aqhpdp9,3.0,"it was a clean work environment where I never felt pressured to do anything that I felt uncomfortable with. The people were nice, the atmosphere was nice. I do not regret my time here."
PetSmart,1c0u260ktbrdnf9n,3.0,"No Comment to this work place, so not leaving a review.  Each place is run differently I am sure."
PetSmart,1c0s7qo8252tqcme,4.0,Animals are fun to be around but there was nearly nothing to do even when the store is busy. Most of the days are spent cleaning and trying to talk to customers who are only interested in looking at the hamsters.
PetSmart,1c0rvcq8452tqb1c,2.0,"Although I love grooming, I am just not happy grooming with my current company. I have such a passion for the animals I work with but I also have a passion to feel and be respected and fairly compensated in my workplace, especially if I am abiding by all standards, protect and model the brand with extreme professionalism"
PetSmart,1c0rv44qo52tqb6p,3.0,"The greatest feeling was working in a pet store, and seeing happy pet parents with their dogs and cats, and being able to interact with them. I was given a variety of projects to work on daily, which greatly involved multi-tasking, time management and workflow management. I was occasionally given the opportunity to train and grow new associates in my department. The most challenging aspect of a typical day was being understaffed, and having to function  single-handedly; however, my ability to multi-task and micromanage was integral to completing my tasks."
PetSmart,1c0ph35i9ak5vc8a,3.0,Managers are competing against each other and constantly fighting! No teamwork and impossible goals to reach bonus incentives so they don’t have to pay bonuses
PetSmart,1c0peehdkak9v8he,4.0,Typical day at work consisted of loading pallets all day long on docked trailers. I learned a great deal on how to improve time management in all aspects of my job. The management was not bad but they care and stress number a great deal. Hardest part of the job is it feels like there is never enough time in the day. Most enjoyable part of the job was time went by fast.
PetSmart,1c0p2t034ak5vbmq,3.0,"Pet smart was a fun environment to work for, but it dose lack in a few places, the culture of the store slowly was lacking when i was there. management did not keep there word when they said they were going to do something and they also never wrote anyone up for verbal harassment. Typical day could take you from cleaning cages to stocking shelves or even on the register."
PetSmart,1c0nn7oct5ndtc2h,1.0,I have mixed feelings because I really enjoyed it the first two years and then the last year management ruined it for me. I am a firm believer that corporate shouldn't run grooming salons but they do and you're more of a machine than a person to them. I do think this is a great start for people who want to get into grooming but not forever.
PetSmart,1c0nlot6vakhocd6,4.0,I went into retail because I love to work with customers.  This store was very clean and customers were treated with respect.  The management team really had their stuff together.

PetSmart,1c0n7tuj0akdofmp,3.0,Job is easy but very repetitive.  Just stock the shelves with inventory and then repeat the next day.  Some managers are laid back and let you just do the work. Others are on your case about getting things done in certain time frames.
PetSmart,1c0n666ugb81nbbv,2.0,"I hated working here. Management was all very immature and unprofessional. They were constantly gossiping and having inappropriate conversations with associates. They would also gang up and harass employees for no reason and then when the employee would try to follow instructions they would find a different reason to complain. We weren't allowed to take proper care of the animals and told to just do quick checks to make sure they had food and water, but not enough time to socialize or check the overall health of the animals. Associates are poorly trained and very rarely know what they are talking about unless they have been there for a long period of time. They never give you your breaks, you have to ask for them or you don't get them.  DON'T WORK HERE!"
PetSmart,1c0mctga2as21fm5,5.0,"I love the company itself, my managers, and my job. The only problem I have is the pay is minimum wage and I agree that for a cashier but, not as a bather. It is very hard work but, I love this job so much that I would keep this on the side for the rest of my life if possible. It is super fun and a way to play with dogs while getting paid. While it isn't always easy it is rewarding."
PetSmart,1c0ko1fsqakhcbs1,4.0,It's been a while since I've worked but it was ok when I was there.
PetSmart,1c0k0u5h4ak9k82d,1.0,"I have always enjoyed working with the pets and pet parents. I am a people person so it comes naturally. I have groomed since i was 16 yrs old, ive always been an animal lover"
PetSmart,1c0ihf1fgak5hfn9,4.0,"amazing job, i love working there but since we had a new manager hired its gone downhill. I love my job and every single one of my coworkers. amazing environment and tons of fun while we work."
PetSmart,1c0i67084ak9kem5,4.0,"working pet care can be anywhere from boring to extremely stressful be it due to the amount of customers or the amount of animals that have suddenly become sick or died. management has the same kind of range,  either the managers are amazing or terrible."
PetSmart,1c0hq9t0qb85h9c1,3.0,"The job itself is quite enjoyable. Unprofessional work environment combined with poor management give regular tasks much unneeded stress. Safety policies that are put in place for the safety and well being of the employee or client are disregarded, to varying degrees,  on a regular basis. When concerns have been voiced to management or Human Resources little to no results have been found."
PetSmart,1c0hgp5bi5j57e2c,2.0,Ever since they went private it has been cut throat.  Managing by treats and not by positive reinforcement.  I liked the job but didn't like upper management.
PetSmart,1c0hgmqbgas1rbqe,4.0,"Petsmart is typical retail.  However, whatever job they hire for you remain in.  They will train you for a job and have training throughout year, but they are more interested in sales than anything else."

PetSmart,1c0fnk92iak5h963,3.0,"It was okay for something temporary, unfortunately I had to leave due to pregnancy complications but I loved working with the animals and educating customers about them."
PetSmart,1c0fb8p4takhcapi,2.0,"During the time I worked at Petsmart many of the managers either didn't do their job correctly or didn't know how. I trained one of the managers for my department and believe he shouldn't have been hired in the first place. Many of the managers are petty or upset and take it out on the employees. I enjoyed working with and taking care of the animals, but it was hard for me to watch some of my coworkers mistreat them/injure them/kill them (all on accident). I met some great people working here, but I also met a lot of not so great people."
PetSmart,1c0essvv65n9ga48,5.0,Petsmart was one of the best jobs I could have because I have a passion for working with animals and the co workers and manager were the best to work with !!
PetSmart,1c0e2qjp4b817f9o,2.0,"Management  doesn’t work or try to work. They bark orders, cut hours, and then get mad for things not getting done. If management just got off their butts and did something, working there might be tolerable. This is not the case for all stores. It all depends on management."
PetSmart,1c0am70r2as1kftm,3.0,The experience here was great I loved working with all the animals and meeting all the clients and helping customers with their animal but the store has slowly changed to just pushing sales no matter what.
PetSmart,1c09j98lcb81782d,5.0,I enjoyed working with my companions and working hard is a fun thing for me to do. it was a fast paced environment and i enjoyed every minute of it even though it was temporary
PetSmart,1c09ekvrjak9hd43,2.0,"Job varied in time from early morning shifts (3 AM) to midday, closing and even the occasional overnight shift.  It was common for me to go to work at noon, leave at 10 be back at 10 the next day, leave at 6, come back at 3 AM the following day.  That's 30 hours of work (not counting the 2 hours of commuting during that time) in a 49 hour time span.  Employee hours are constantly being cut and we are expected to do more with less while achieving ever increasing customer satisfaction standards."

PetSmart,1c084fkqhaqhcd7l,3.0,"I loved working for Petsmart, I just had trouble as a new manager to the company trying to fix the rules that no one ever followed for the past few years, since i was new, no one took it seriously when i got my higher managers involved in the problem"
PetSmart,1c07qhjevak9hft5,4.0,I loved working at petsmart. Coworkers were the best and helpful but the management at 1299 in springfield sucks. Nice to your face and nothing but terrible things to say behind your back. Quick to agree with client over employees in negative situation and will give away free things before actually resolving problem.
PetSmart,1c073nr03brd49dh,2.0,"PetSmart is to stressful to be a fun place to work. The priorities are always shifting, the goals change daily, the company expects to much with to little."

PetSmart,1c05hjr5hb88mei2,4.0,"You're always learning something new! Also working towards becoming a groomer was fun! i was sad to leave pet smart but i was working 3 jobs at the time, i would definitely recommend becoming a bather and groomer."
PetSmart,1c05dh9pdak9b99t,4.0,It is a very fast paced job and you make decent money if your fast. You will deal with people as well as dogs. You will have to deal with dogs who feces and urine on you as well.
PetSmart,1c04l8chmakd7fmi,2.0,"Its very competitive and very unprofessional. The groomers are commission based so stealing dogs happens frequently, the pay is good but the stress is difficult to deal with."
PetSmart,1c03m12gf52t3dcq,4.0,fun place to work - customers seek your advice and you were allowed to bring pets to work. Only thing I hated was inventory. The process was too cumbersome and could be refined
PetSmart,1c02qe04nakh7f59,4.0,They were very flexible with my work schedule to allow me to switch up my hours when I needed them. If I did not have to move out of the area I would have stayed employed.

PetSmart,1c02cf3oeas1f9lk,4.0,Great job if your looking to work with animals. I've learned a lot about how to care of different types of animals. The people that come in are normally very nice and friendly.
PetSmart,1c0299qk9b85aclr,1.0,"Management is horrendous, and generally treat their employees a little bit better than cattle. Do not work here longer than necessary. You had to take your 15 minute breaks on time or you would get coached, same went for lunch breaks, clocking in and out on time, and giving more than a three week notice for any time off requests."
PetSmart,1c01hm306akh7933,5.0,"Pros include: 15% employee discount, 50% off bag of PetSmart brand dog or cat food monthly, several paid sick days. Cons: selfish/stupid managers, ever changing schedule, being forced to go with no lunch break, clopens (meaning you close and then open the store the following day)"
PetSmart,1c00f5b935ncu9t5,2.0,The work place was decent. Very fast paced and very technical. Everything must be done near perfect and you cannot be late. If you are sick and they send you home they will fire you.
PetSmart,1c000i9fnb858ee7,5.0,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers and their animals. The job in its entirety was a great place to work. The management team was great to work for, I would work for this company again."
PetSmart,1bvvdj82s52ss8ld,3.0,"I loved my job at PetSmart for the first year until management changed. There was no chance of advancing my career despite there being openings and myself being qualified.The new management not only does not care for the pets, they also don't care about the employees. I received no consideration following being hospitalized for a week and was scheduled even though I was supposed to be on required bed rest for a few months. I fainted on the floor and at the register multiple times and was still expected to do heavy lifting and was given little to no help, realizing no one cared, I left."
PetSmart,1bvu2g7u11d1e614,2.0,"Very poor training after you do the basic computer classes.  When you are trained poorly then constantly nagged at for doing things wrong it becomes very stressful.  Managers aren't always very friendly and they all do things different so you can easily get in trouble for doing something wrong that you've been told was right.  Employees are not enabled to do the right thing for customers and as a cashier you are left basically alone running the entire front of store. Any prices and sales are not correct in the register so you constantly have to call for help then get a nasty attitude by management for bugging them.  You are constantly pressured to sell puppy guides, get emails, and sell training or get donations.  It feels like you are constantly begging your customers and getting nasty feedback for doing so.  Also some staff come to work high but managers do nothing.  Also have watched a lot of employee theft and again no response or action from managers.  Very frustrating place to work.  Don't plan on getting full time, cruddy shifts and they don't want to pay full time employees."
PetSmart,1bvsisvocbrcpcce,1.0,At the beginning of my time at Petsmart i enjoyed working but worked very hard which is ok.  By the time i left Petsmart my manager had switched and it was one of the worst choices that Petsmart could have made.  The business center manager was not only a terrible person but one of the worst managers i have ever worked for!!
PetSmart,1bvshnnvkaqh1aa0,5.0,"I loved my job and if I hadn't needed more money to make ends meet, I would still be there. Everyone worked together, laughed together, and we knew our customers by name as well as their pets' names."
PetSmart,1bvsdrj46akd6d42,5.0,I would still be working here if I lived closer. The hours required to work here coincided with my kids school schedule. The fact that I have to get my kids up & ready for school dictates the type of job/schedule I need.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1bvr0najgakh08gt,3.0,"I liked working for this company but the hours were not good for me, and if you don't meet quota during the holidays you have to stay and work even though you have been there 12 plus hours. Management is ok, but if you have a family don't plan on seeing them on a regular basis because you will be working all of the time."
PetSmart,1bvqtnjelbrcp9th,5.0,"The happiest place to work, other than Disneyland. The entire building is committed to the care of pets, a cherished part of every community and family. The selection and special vendor interaction events offer direct consumer knowledge of products before committing your pet to a product."
PetSmart,1bvpv2c4dbrcpf73,5.0,"Working at petsmart was overall really fun and you learn a lot about animals and environments you never even knew about. The customers who came into petsmart were my favorite because we both shared a love for animals so everyone was always so nice. If you have a lot of allergies or even the slightest allergies to animals or HAY then i wouldn’t suggest working here because i was miserable every time i had to do bedding changes. As a pet care Associate you’re always doing something, if you have down time you’re scrubbing tanks. If you’re done scrubbing tanks you’re cleaning out bedding. You practically get into trouble when you aren’t doing anything. Make sure if you get this job that you have comfortable shoes because you will be on your feet the entire shift. Also the animals DO bite. The hamsters have broken my skin many times and have even bitten customers."
PetSmart,1bvp5o9vbaqh1dml,5.0,i had a great time working for petsmart the environment was nice the store was always clean the customers were always amazing petting dogs and cats was a plus
PetSmart,1bvomv935aqh1dgr,5.0,"The job itself wasn't bad at all, I more-so couldn't afford the distance to pay ratio. I had to manage my priorities, while I loved the job I just couldn't afford to work there."
PetSmart,1bvo6ss3dakh0feo,5.0,I was just driving a forklift picking up and dropping off loading and loading them in the right trucks. but overall it was a great work environment and very safe.
PetSmart,1bvo3sfm3ak54e1g,3.0,"Made lots of empty promises, often screwed up my schedule and then blamed me for it. Management picks favorites and insults employees. Discriminated against a pregnant coworker. The manager never actually did any work, only ever sat in his office on the phone gossiping. Often called employees incompetent. Pet care manager does not do her job. Often kills fish on purpose or just let's them die. Needless to say this place is not worth it."
PetSmart,1bvnsrmouak93euc,4.0,I had fun working at petsmart and learning the different care the animals needed. The coworkers were fun and usually happy to be there. I loved working the different shifts they had to offer and had the oppertunity to learn the different areas.
PetSmart,1bvmsqtj35ncua4a,5.0,"Come and play with dogs and cat, help customer to make the best decision for the pet, teach the dogs behaviors and people friendly. When we have a customer for many years and the pet pass."
PetSmart,1bvj75o3vaqh1dbg,1.0,"My managers called me names, made fun of customers, and didnnot care about any of the animals. We went through managers more than you should change your underwear.  It was insane how often we had new employees and managers bc they were so awful. Nobody was properly trained on animals and it was the main reason I decided to leave.  I was cross-trained on register, pet care, salon, and training and I made less than EVERYONE there."
PetSmart,1bviq6co15ncu84m,1.0,work you literally like a dog!!!!! Rude managers and DM's that could careless for your well being! I worked here for 3 years and I barely have the time to breathe!
PetSmart,1bvihkm35akh0b8h,3.0,"I loved my job until they gave my boss a promotion. The new manager lets a lot of in-fighting happen and it's become increasingly uncomfortable. No one likes getting yelled at. If I could have a calmer team, it'd be a fantastic place."
PetSmart,1bvih0sqtas15doj,5.0,"I really would like to help out with the dogs please. I will start my job December 1st. And I will always always come after school. I also have a disability including Autism, assburgers, OCD and another one I totally forgot just to let you know."
PetSmart,1bvie2b095ncub74,2.0,"PetSmart doesn't use operational common sense in running their business.  They focus on the smallest of details and the most irrelevant things, but then turn around and cut payroll to the point that you can't even maintain day to day operations without your salaried managers working 60 plus hours a week."
PetSmart,1bvgc87flaqh18s4,3.0,"Great place to work. must be able to lift 50 lbs. many times per day. Not a fast pace place except during the holidays. Very early mornings, 5:00am. Nights are not too late, 8:00pm - 9:00pm."
PetSmart,1bvgaqp9sak54cfm,5.0,"PetSmart was my first job it was the most fun job I have ever had, a typical day was BUSY but it was great and I very much enjoyed it."

PetSmart,1bvdp25f8ak4rdes,1.0,"When I started in 2011 I loved working for PetSmart, however in 2014 the company was bought out and overhauled everything. They brought in outside management that had no knowledge of the pet industry. The quality of the live animals declined due to the decreased budget. Employee hours were cut while unreasonable standards were implemented. Working there became a nightmare overnight."

PetSmart,1bvbkba92ak4re1v,3.0,A good company to work for just not enough pay. The lunch break is not long enough for a 8 hour shift staying on your feet. They are flexible with have a family.
PetSmart,1bvbapc1nak4r9ui,5.0,"I started working here thinking that it would only be a winter job, but ended up finding my niche! It's a wonderful place, honestly.  If you ever want a job, where you can just be you, try Petsmart!"
PetSmart,1bvb16evsak4r905,3.0,I enjoy working at a place where customers can bring their pets in with them. However the store is poorly managed. You work hard and go above and beyond and you are not appreciated for it.
PetSmart,1bvabhug65n8mfn2,5.0,"I work overnight so although I wil like more hours, it’s difficult BUT other than that I enjoy it. It can be stressful at times but thats like any job"
PetSmart,1bv9c14dtakco9dd,4.0,Working at PetSmart was good experience. The management is unorganized and lazy but they were really cool and chill. They treat their animals very well and they care a lot.
PetSmart,1bv95npd30mcv5jj,4.0,"I was a full time night shift worker at the Pet Hotel, not in retail, but I loved my job. I worked full time, the pay was well worth it, and the job felt very rewarding."
PetSmart,1bv7tnbrp52skcja,5.0,"Very fast pace  productive work place, accomplish 3 promotions and 2 certificates. A typical day for me would check everybody productions on the weekend shift just to see if they was making production if they wasn't i would offer them more training. The hardest part for me is when i offer more training and they received more training and still wasn't able to perform productivity they would have to get terminated due to not making production."
PetSmart,1bv7oqrvnaqgqefc,5.0,"store walks, safety walks and the pets were great.  the store was laid back, the pet salon not so much, a lot of attitude in there, but with a commission job it is to be somewhat expected."
PetSmart,1bv75qa23aqgqc8a,4.0,It's a decent place overall. Depending on what store you're applying to will weigh greatly in your experiences with the company. It depends much upon your management staff/experience/ & store location/traffic.
PetSmart,1bv5pfkh2akgoccs,2.0,"I was the youngest worker, at 18, so I expected some confrontation, but nothing like this. I was treated like a child and was often excluded from in and out of work activities. Towards February, I became very very ill with the Shingles virus and they cut my hours from 20-30 a week to only 4 hours a week. Four. Hours. I couldn't make ends meet so I complained very respectfully and nicely. The gm didn't sit with me and take me seriously, instead, he continued to walk away and talk to me with his mouth full thus, I quit right then and there."
PetSmart,1bv5d1912ak8qalf,5.0,My job was to handle transactions of products from the store to check out people and make sure their experience at the store was excellent. To provide great customer service
PetSmart,1bv5c50u95n8mf9r,4.0,"Not here anymore, this is not my most current job, indeed you need to fix this problem.  I do not want this part time job to be the first one they see!"
PetSmart,1bv3rqj1r1d0b69r,3.0,"Low pay and no benefits for Bathers, but if you want to be a groomer there is potential for a decent income. The employee discounts are nice if you have a pet as well."
PetSmart,1bv3nn5djakgoa1o,3.0,First off I worked for two locations. My first Macedonia was nice but my managers were not as fun and the store was small. The last one Fair lawn was mostly fun but very large and required a fast step to keep up or your left behind.
PetSmart,1bv3nl4nc5nckcbu,3.0,"Not as pet focused as it used to be, driven strongly by metrics. Some of the upper management is complacent and do not properly uphold policies and procedures. The lack of consistency is confusing for staff."
PetSmart,1bv36i9lgakgob8p,3.0,"You basically greet people, then greet their dog, cat, iguana, or whichever animal is present, and then see what they need. Best part is you get to pet animals ALL THE TIME!"
PetSmart,1bv306187ak8qa9u,4.0,"I loved my job at PetSmart. I worked in PetCare so I dealt with the small animals, fish, and reptiles all day. It is a lot of work though because you're required to scrub and siphon fish tanks by a certain deadline in the week. Also, you have to change bedding, feed fish, give medication to any animals needing it, driving to and from vet with sick animals, and assisting customers with any questions they might have. Overall I loved my job and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loved animals and is looking for part time."
PetSmart,1bv2uogf0ak8qf9s,3.0,"I really enjoyed working for Petsmart until it went through new managment. I feel allot of times issues are ignored in different areas of the store and some of the managers act unprofessional. I worked there for 7 years and didnt even reach $1.50 more in pay raise from when I first started and I was even promoted to a higher positions that took on allot more responsibility and people hired in were hired making more an hour than I was. I feel Petsmart should give their employees that put in the time and years working there more benefits, higher pay, and more respect."
PetSmart,1bv2oi9d0ak8q87m,3.0,NEW mangement has taken over now so i have no clue how the place is run myself but I hear it is worse than when I worked there 4 years ago. You can see all kinds of animals come in but you gotta clean up the mess if the owner doesnt

PetSmart,1bv2hc9s5aqgoaar,4.0,They have an active CARE program for associates that rewards them for positive behavior and actions which works. They earn cards that they can redeem treats.
PetSmart,1bv25jqr4ak8qc0m,1.0,I started as early morning stock and I loved my first shift manager and I love the actual job however the organization of the stock room is really bad. Stuff comes off the trucks and we don't need the stock at all so it piles up. Work hours are based off a store work hour allowance and they run super thin. In my first two weeks of training I got less then 30 hours. This week i got 5. The store manager is super intense without anything really going on and doesnt mind talking down about the other managers to regular floor workers. I feel that efficiency is not the companies strong point and a lot can be fixed.
PetSmart,1bv17odo9akgkfm2,1.0,"Worst job I have ever worked, rude store manager, animals were not taken care of very well, everything in the backroom where the animals cages were cleaned was filthy and smelled terrible and it was so stressful i came home every night crying."
PetSmart,1bv0r0lj01d182o5,3.0,I work mostly at night and in the morning certain days. it is constantly buys and when it's not were cleaning. the stores are usually dirty and the back of hotel is disgusting. most people who work there are really cool and I love the environment but the management constantly changes as people are always leaving because the pay is too low for the amount of stress that comes with the job.
PetSmart,1bv0dk9jf0mcr4sc,3.0,"5 am start time 320pm quit time everyday, i learned how to pick at petsmarts how to drive a pallet jack and some what of a forklift, great workplace culture"
PetSmart,1bv05o7evakgkb2p,2.0,"Working at PetSmart started out great, but quickly went downhill. After the company was sold they just stopped caring and became a very money oriented company. Everything they did was how they could make more money and there was no care about the animals in their care. They have become very task oriented to the point where there is more work than hours given to complete the task. They have unrealistic expectations, for example we may have a total of 35 hours in store resets, plus trucks and all the merchandising activities that they require and we will only be given 55 hours to complete everything. That is not even enough hours in a week to have two people to work all of those tasks. The culture is a huge popularity contest, and promotions are done based on who likes you instead of how well you do your job. If you are not someone that is liked in the store they are to bully and harass a person until they quite. If you are in management you will be hourly unless a store leader and many times the expectation is to work 6 days but only get paid for 40 hours. On average you will work about 46 hours but not get paid for the other hours because they make you take a little bit longer of a lunch or have you come in a little late another day to cut out the overtime. Hardest part about the job is to hit the unrealistic goals or get wrote up for not hitting the goals. Some of the requirements for cashiers is to sell puppy guides which the coupons are only good for people with puppies and very difficult to get your money back on unless you are buying all new items for the puppy, getting"
PetSmart,1bv04eaklakckaeq,2.0,"I worked at the appleton store for a year. It was nice at first but after a while my co workers slacked and i was expected to pick up the pace. Management played favorites and screwed me over. The shifts went by slowly and the breaks went fast. We were yelled at if we werent constantly doing something when if there was nothing to do (slow days).  Peopel think working at a petstore means playing with animals but honestly its 90% cleaning, 5% customer service and 5% selling animals and products."
PetSmart,1buuo112mak8ma1v,4.0,"I loved working at Pet Smart.  I do feel that moving up in the company was done unfairly, I felt it was who you got in good with and not how hard you worked. I still love the company, I guess it was just where I was."
PetSmart,1buum0q3eas0m88i,1.0,Paid minimum wage for dangerous work (animals that can act out at any time in unfamiliar/ scary environments.) Management was unhelpful. Only a 15 percent off employee discount. Very dangerous work in the salon. No safety precautions taken for the employees.
PetSmart,1buto75m5as0maoe,3.0,"In life you stride to be the best ""u"" you can be, when giving opportunities what you do with is totally up to you, me personally I like to achieve and go beyond any of my potential traits,never get comfortable with being content......because life can change in a blank of a eye."

PetSmart,1buslt8ho1d0r1ef,4.0,"My typical day would be restock shelves, unload trucks, customer service, assign work to other stockers, gather shopping carts from parking lots. I learned how to care for many animals, leadership skills, and how to work as a team. Most the work was easy, only difficult part would be cleaning up the animals mess if you don't have the stomach for it, and working with the interns who were all high school students. Some just don't listen. The actual employees were all fun and easy to work with. The managers were awesome always took care of us, never to mean as long as we did the jobs they gave us."
PetSmart,1busarh450mcl51b,2.0,Worked there in highshool and they worked around school hours. Got a new manager who started getting rid of everyone who already worked there. Instead of saying anything she just stopped scheduling me and when i asked about it said they were too slow to give me hours
PetSmart,1bus3h2t91d0i568,4.0,A typical day at work consists of standing at a cash register from when your shift starts to when it ends. Except when you open you help stock the shelves. I have learned great customer service skills. The management is great. Very friendly people. The hardest part of the job would be when it gets to busy sometimes you don't get any help. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely meeting all of the cute puppies.
PetSmart,1burml36tak4ma4h,4.0,The manager was a good and honest man. I was always hwppy to get there. The crew made you want to work harder. They offered benefits that were inexpensive.
PetSmart,1bur3acv40mcl3bp,5.0,The atmosphere was great. It is a fast paced environment but everyone was friendly and the manager genuinely cared about the associates. I liked the lunch hour it was longer then most places.
PetSmart,1bupvvgfk1bac5di,5.0,"I worked in the salon as a bather. I didn't like how the groomers treated us like servants, because they work for commission. But the actual job was great. I got to spend all day with dogs. lol awesome."

PetSmart,1buk6fo6q1d0i72k,4.0,"Working in the grooming salon, you were disconnected from the other part of the store. It was almost like it was disconnected from it yet still had to follow the rules of the store and the salon and sometimes they contradicted themselves, you depending on who was on shift meant you followed which set of rules. Management strictness and interpretation of mandatory things were vastly different. The environment fluctuated between cut throat, back stabbing to loving and caring depending on the business busy times."

PetSmart,1bui3q3571bac6a8,1.0,"I spent 7 years with this company, working my way up from an associate to one of the top management positions. Corporate pressures management to do the unthinkable, associates not treated well/expected to bust their a**es for average pay, HR dept is damage control for the company and absolutely does not care about its associates. Horrible work environment. Tension from everybody being stressed out due to corporate expectations."
PetSmart,1bugsmvsl1d114li,3.0,"The company is great and I believe in the mission. However, I wouldn't recommend the IT culture too highly. While I was there factions developed that led to many friends and co-workers being moved on in their careers for political reasons."

PetSmart,1buf6mo84as15cdo,1.0,"Work conditions were abhorrent, with known medical issues and doctors notes being flat out ignored. Managers often made employees feel like they did not care about them. Hours were sporadic at best, and upper management had an attitude problem if you couldn't cover a surprise availability at the drop of a hat. At mandatory meetings, they didn't provide so much as water."
PetSmart,1buereuv81fdn5d9,5.0,I worked for PetSmart for over 2 years and in every department and not once did I come across a negative person. Everybody was always uplifting and passionate about their job. PetSmart cultivates a positive atmosphere and produces happy employees AND customers. Such a great experience working there.
PetSmart,1buecldnlas15fmj,4.0,"Not for the faint of heart, it is a demanding , fast paced, detail oriented position. Time management & strong work ethic a MUST. Working with the animals & building a bond with the owners is the most rewarding part of the job."
PetSmart,1buecevlnb84o9hr,2.0,"Once the original managers quit or were fired the amount of work I did tripled.

PetSmart,1bud2lteh5nfi9a7,5.0,"Pretty great place to work, fun and friendly environment, lots of animal interaction. If you are an animal lover than it is just the best. Mornings can be rough. Opening duties are more taxing than closing duties, like deep cleaning habitats on set mornings for each type of habitat."
PetSmart,1bucpijiqas15cbr,5.0,"Early mornings and late evenings are very slow and gets boring, however the mid day shift is extremely busy, fast paced and sometimes hectic. The team of employees are always there for each others needs and questions. The PetSmart team is truly a family within itself.  Head cashier is in charge of being on the busiest register in the store. Occasionally I would have to switch placed with the floor walker and approach customers , identify their needs and assist with merchandise selection. The hardest part of the day is a hour before closing time, one employee has to ""face"" the entire store, while the other employee stands at the register. ""facing the store"" means that every can of dog food and every item on all the shelves must be facing forward and stocked properly."
PetSmart,1bubuui1dak558kr,5.0,a typical day at PetSmart is going in with a positive attitude and thinking how many customers can I make smile today. I did gain a lot of knowledge in the 5 years working for PetSmart. Hardest part of the job was not being able to take home all the cute puppies!
PetSmart,1bubjbvgc5j7b8j9,4.0,"PetSmart has been one of my favorite places to work so far. The people are great, the company really seems to care about their employees, and if you're full time then you receive all benefits (health, 401k, paid time, etc.) which is really nice. The only complaint I have is that, depending on which store you work in, it can be very difficult to get to full time. The hours can also be pretty inconsistent. I went several weeks working less than 10 hours a week, then back to 20+ without any notice. This might be the fault of my Store Leader, since I'm not entirely sure she knew what she was doing at the time, but still not something anyone was happy with. Other than that, it's a great place to work and I would highly recommend giving it a go if you're considering it. I will miss working here."
PetSmart,1bubicj185nbkajp,5.0,PetSmart is an awesome place to work! The people that work there are friendly and helpful; the customers and pretty generous as well minus the few difficult ones from time-to-time.
PetSmart,1bu9s682m52vf8ud,4.0,"This job is really fun if you enjoy working with and around animals. It was tough waking up early in the mornings to stock shelves, but as a cashier it was enjoyable to meet new people and interact with animals."
PetSmart,1bu9i5iem1fdh1ku,2.0,Overall great job but it's more of something that you start when you're just looking for a job and you're still in high school or if you're looking to learn more about animals and their habitats which I learned a lot from
PetSmart,1bu9ed3k7ak50b8v,4.0,While I worked at Petsmart it was a good job the employees where nice but the management not so much either I was giving 4 hours for the week being a full time employees or I was working alone on busy hours with no help!
PetSmart,1bu9dvkltak50a07,2.0,Petsmart culture has changed since buy out. Unreachable goals set by corporate leaders. Weak management habits with poor mentorship and opportunity for growth.
PetSmart,1bu966lce1d17259,4.0,"working for petsmart was fun, fast paced and always different. there was structure, but at the same time you were always doing different things. i started in petcare and cashier duties. providing great customer service and exceptional animal care is our goal. the leaders were great and i loved my coworkers. the hardest part of the job was angry customers. just learning how to handle tuff situations. the most enjoyable part is being able to provide and care for every persons animals."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.  The workplace and culture is fantastic.The hardest part of the job was when I tried to work as a groomer.  I was not successful at that so the manager found what I was successful at.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1bu7eoqcsakctb4t,3.0,I love the work hours but there isn't a advancement placement for going up in the company. the management is a disappointment and doesn't appreciate their workers
PetSmart,1bu7bkvhpakgtc3d,2.0,"Any job can be a good or bad job depending on management. In my particular case, management believed that customer service and numbers were far more important than the lives of animals and the lives of their workers."
PetSmart,1bu6qcbkh1d171gv,5.0,"Our salon/ store was low volume so work is relatively slow paced. I love the opportunity to work with pets daily. The job culture is fantastic. PetSmart makes recognizing employee's hard work a priority. Management feels like family. I enjoy getting up and going to work and I feel that I have gained life-long friendships during my two years working there. There are advancement opportunities, but they require you to work full-time. As a college student I had to deny promotions and make less than half a dollar more an hour than I did when I was hired despite being told I am the best they have at my position. That has been frustrating, but is mostly just a conflict of interests on my part."
PetSmart,1bu6o5r0kakgtdj9,1.0,"I enjoyed working close with clients and animals, a typical day working as a groomer is full of running around, bathing animals, cutting nails, shaving hair, scheduling appointments and taking calls. It is a very fast paced environment and I had to multitask all day everyday."
PetSmart,1bu6elqnaaqh0cd9,4.0,"Petsmart is a fast growing company.  Management staff varies on each location, but overall it's a solid company to work for.  The benefits are incredible as well."
PetSmart,1bu46gmam52vfe4u,2.0,It went from being a fun place to work to a stressful work environment that stressed cost cutting at the expense of turnover and efficiency. Not enough training hours given for new hires and no leadership training given to management
PetSmart,1bu31ldfob80m9o0,4.0,"Overall Petsmart is a fun and easy place to work, you get to pet dogs all day as well as take care of sick/ healthy animals. Overall the lower management was fantastic but once you got higher up such as GM, district, there was a lack of care and lack of communication."
PetSmart,1bu2ebmkhakgtb76,5.0,"The Norman Ok store was very good. I loved the environment, I would have stayed here if there was more room for advancement, but overall a great place."
PetSmart,1bu1ophei1d0r6bi,5.0,I worked here for a month and only left due to relocation. I'd highly recommend working here. Management and co-workers were great and getting to interact with customers and their pets all day was the best.
PetSmart,1bu1a815852vf9q7,5.0,"Petsmart makes you feel you are a part of a family. They make you feel like you can do anything you have wish of, and they are very supportive within your career with them. They enjoy training and offering people positions."
PetSmart,1bu0j9tu6b80mcf4,3.0,It's great if you're ok with being overbooked or pushed to take on more than you want. I would get stuck with too many appointments most days and left to find something different.
PetSmart,1btv8o23vb80mejf,3.0,"Unfortunately the management at my location had no communication skills and the rules were constantly changing depending on which manager was ""in charge"" at the time making it hard to do the ""right"" thing. At my location unfortunately the managers there were not very likely to follow the P+P's that the company had set forth. But the customers and fellow co-workers were great people to work with almost making up for the fact that the managers were not. Almost but not quite."
PetSmart,1btusccn4akgt9fm,5.0,I love working for Petsmart and all the opportunities of meeting other pet parents and other pets. I have learned how to handle complicated situations and learned so much about animal care there is to offer. It's really a fun place to work at.
PetSmart,1btuphqsras10dae,3.0,"Overall it was not a bad place to work for it is part time so no benefits and there were a few duties that they did not describe when they hired me. The scheduling was the main issue it is never consistent and i frequently had to work days that I said were unavailable. However, we did have fun especially when we had events at work and everyone was patient when training me. The overall work environment is fast paced and can be stressful especially during holidays."
PetSmart,1btug5c70ak93cd5,5.0,"It was a great place to work.  I enjoyed the work, but I was not give many hours since there were multiple people that needed hours.  Otherwise, a great place to work.."
PetSmart,1bttga1675nfcaij,5.0,9am to 8pm
PetSmart,1bttdm1bsbrftckk,5.0,The only thing I didn't like about working there is that they try to push you into grooming which fro me created a lot of stress. I prefer to just take care of the animals.
PetSmart,1btsk2jjbb80mebj,3.0,At the time the managers where ridiculous. One was sexist. While the other was very controlling. The other employees where very awesome and understanding. Decent work times though they wouldn't  work with your schedule. Well at least my schedule they didnt
PetSmart,1btsa282rakgtagt,4.0,"PetSmart is such an odd company to work for in the sense that your experience will be completely contingent on the store you work at. Because of the sale of live animals, customers that try to argue about sales can be all the more frustrating. Many times there are customers that do not have adequate set ups (ie: fish tanks, hamster enclosures, reptile habitats) that want the animal anyway. And if you care about the animals, you generally try to refuse. If you have managers that will back you up when it comes to customer conflicts, then you won't have any grief - but if not, then your experience can be completely miserable and this is absolutely the kind of job that can send you home in tears every day. It's a great place for animal lovers to expand their knowledge of exotics, but keep in mind that there WILL be a sale of animal to an under educated customer that you won't be able to stop - and it will break your heart."
PetSmart,1bts7u5vd52vfdpj,4.0,The pay is very good in comparison to other pet retailers.  There is a strict adherance to policies and procedures.  It is a very professional place to work.
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers."
PetSmart,1btqh1et3as0q82u,4.0,"Not a bad place to work. I have been there for over 6 years (5 of which were spent as an associate, the rest in management). A great group of people to be around. I have learned so much about animal nutrition and being able to solve customer problems about their pets. I have learned valuable communication and customer service skills that I will take with me forever. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with unrealistic corporate expectations. Management can be rewarding but its not always a walk in the park. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of my job is the animals by far! I love being able to go into work every day knowing that I get to see some really cool animals and help people find solutions and products that will help their pets. It's all about the pets!!"
PetSmart,1btq6ar551d0n0nj,2.0,I ran the morning stock team. I drove the forklift and got pallets down from the steel and filled shelves daily. The job was fast pace and the manager i worked for was difficult
PetSmart,1btpop91makgoctl,4.0,"Super fun place to work, lots of good people, managers are rude, unwilling to work with employees, pet care specialists are super underpaid for what they do, and they will switch your job on you if they don't feel like hiring."
PetSmart,1btpnufpk9rckelu,4.0,ces conditions n'étaient pas favorables en 2003 mais ont connu une amélioration
PetSmart,1btoebd7o5nf795n,5.0,As a stocker I came in at 4am - but often the truck wasn't there until 5 to 7am
PetSmart,1btoamt3lakgoeov,1.0,"Schedule is constantly rotating, you never know what kind of hours you're going to have or what days you will work."
PetSmart,1bto61kf5brfr9kk,4.0,For pet lovers a fun place to work. A good first job for high schoolers wanting to explore the world of retail. You learn a variety of pets products and become knowledgeable to help other pet parents.
PetSmart,1bto1u5s652v9fno,5.0,I wouldn't give up this job for anything! I'm looking to add more job experience in the animal field! I do recommend applying! All animal lovers would benefit from this! I adore going into work everyday to see all my regular animals and other animals who come in!
PetSmart,1btnt933r5nb9dad,3.0,"Good place to work for anyone in school, who's looking to work in a fun atmosphere. Helping pet parents find everything they need for there new family members."
PetSmart,1btnrjofoas0qcot,3.0,"overall Petsmart as a company is all about the $ now. their inventory is horrible, never have items the customers need and fish are very poor quality."
PetSmart,1btnn7oek5nb99f7,4.0,Made great friends here; love working with the dogs; my manager is awesome though the assistant manager can be abrasive; need to move to a higher paying job
PetSmart,1btngpv425j71fpq,5.0,"I loved my job because I love pets. I was the Inventory Manager  I worked day and night shifts with a lot of merchandise to stock with very little help. This was explained to the Director and nothing was done about it, which made the job challenging wasn't the problem with being challenging but the expectations were not possible."
PetSmart,1btn5e3bfb8bs8i7,5.0,"When arrived at work the managers usually have tasks ready to be worked on. Whether its stocking, pet care or cashier. Along with that is always customer service. Managers are always organized and friendly. While working at PetSmart I learned customer service and how to watch for signs of sickness or stress in animals. The most enjoyable part of my job is engaging with pet parents and building relationships with them."
PetSmart,1btmr5pavas0qals,4.0,"I loved working at PetSmart so far my favorite job. I worked in the PetsHotel and it was fun, engaging, and I learned a lot about animals everyday. If I could go back I definitely would."
PetSmart,1btlof6sjaqgp835,4.0,"Petsmart is a fun place to work if you're into animals. Hours are flexible, and the pay is ok. The management however often seems a little slow to act on certain situations, however they are there for you when you need them. Honestly, every experience depends on the people around you in the store, working with friends greatly increases the amount of fun that you will have."
PetSmart,1btlk252uas0qejo,1.0,"An average day: prepare the store for opening by counting the tills and setting up the registers. Remove the fish that died overnight (you will have some each day), feed the adoptable cats and fish, clean out the cat's cages. Once the store is open: check in dogs at the salon, run the cash register, stock shelves, customer service, answer phones, schedule grooming appointments, assist groomers with dogs, handle complaints, catch and bag fish, and always sell, sell, sell. At the end of the day clean the fish tanks, scrub the fish's filtration socks, count the tills, prepare the deposit, face the store, and clean the bathrooms."
PetSmart,1btkg1k1kbrfobkj,4.0,Get store ready before store opens. Feed and clean small animals. Clean fish tanks and clean crickets. Stock and straighten shelves. Greet customers and help them.
PetSmart,1btkfej0r5j71fue,3.0,I have mostly enjoyed my time at PetSmart with respect to the actual job. What made the job difficult is all the expectations that corporate places on their associates without truly understanding the impact on how we are able to do our jobs.
PetSmart,1btk2clmsakgofo3,1.0,I would not recommended working here. They expect you to do too much with not enough people or resources. They do not care for their employees. The company is moving away from taking care of the animals and becoming money hungry.
PetSmart,1btj7s4o0brfoept,2.0,"I liked working for PetSmart only because of the small animals that I sold.  I got to learn how to take care of exotic pets such as fish, anoles, frogs, ferrets, birds, so on and so forth.  That was probably the most fun part of the job that I enjoyed."
PetSmart,1e7vkfovsotao800,5.0,"My experience at PetSmart.  The employees are welcoming, concerning, and supportive.  The schedule is flexible.  I learned a variety of skills needed for the store to be successful.  the management encourages employee success.

PetSmart,1btj11351akgofke,3.0,"The groomers looks down on every who is not a groomer. They are unprofessional, would bring there drama to work. When costumers were present they didnt care, they would talk about  inappropriate thing. They would always forget to give dogs water. If a dog pooped they would move a dog but leave the pool for somone else to clean. There is mildew all in the bathing room its been making me sick."
PetSmart,1btivppjias0qb78,2.0,The company did not want input from lower management or hourly employees. The job could be good if not the one rule works for all stores mentality. Upper management could care less about employees personal situations. Worst job I ever had!
PetSmart,1btih4olnbrfocnf,2.0,"Having a grooming salon manager who is also suppose to be a regular groomer hit a dog and nothing be said about it, is awful. It makes it very hard to work in a place with a person like that, but we have documentation and proof of the laziness of this manager and do intend to be talking to corporate about the issues that are at hand and have yet to be mentioned to them."
PetSmart,1bti6khm352v9dce,1.0,Compensation and benefits are great but no work/life balance. Technology is not up to date. Culture/metrics/vision constantly changing. Schedule fluctuates weekly.
PetSmart,1bthvs8ml1d0n7l3,5.0,very fast pace high energy environment. good to know about all animals. everyone is so positive. good to have retail experience. be prepared with a flexible schedule.
PetSmart,1btfin9sj5nb9f5q,4.0,Enjoy working with all different types of Dog. You learn to have patience with the different dogs behavior and gratitude from pet parents. At the end of the day you feel accomplished and proud of the work you have done.
PetSmart,1bteio4rm1d0n0ee,4.0,got to work with pet all day. they were supper fun and friendly. each pet has their own personality and every owner to match. they came in the shop looking or smelling bad and in need of a good cleaning and left looking and smelling great. it was hard work but very rewarding.
PetSmart,1btdgufjfakgoe68,3.0,"Giving some credit to the company, it was an excellent job when I started there I learned how to deal with customers and fine tune my skills without the badgering and time consuming retail up sells."
PetSmart,1btd4ms3i5nb982i,3.0,"Although I enjoyed the satisfaction of making the dogs look wonderful, the job is very physical. Manipulating heavy dogs is demanding on the physical body."
PetSmart,1btd3lhrkakcnf1s,5.0,"I LOVED working here. It gave me the chance to learn about and play with the animals. The best part was when I became a dog bather. I enjoyed the group of people that I got to work with everyday. I wish we wouldn't have had to relocate because they were wanting to send me to grooming school, which would have been AWESOME."
PetSmart,1btcvr3kpas0qdkn,2.0,Working in the grooming department was a lot of fun. I liked working with the dogs. It is not always easy to trim a dogs nail but the need to trim dog nails is important.
PetSmart,1btbcvdca1d0g26l,1.0,"It's possible that my review is just based on the store, and not necessarily the company as a whole, but some things go hand-in-hand. I was told on several accounts that I was over qualified for the job but never got advancement opportunities and got paid barely above minimum wage."
PetSmart,1btaovqdr1d086t6,2.0,"The job was okay at first, it really depends on the management. When I started the job was fine, the assistant manager was understanding and very efficient in his job. The store manager was a jerk and belittled staff. The next set of managers was worse than the fist set. The store manager was a sexist jerk and the assistant was a ""please every customer"" type. There's pleasing customers and then there's making a profit off of animals and selling them when you know they're going to come back dead. Empty promises of a promotion. Very little schedule flexibility. Awful morale and a secondary management team that was stuck in high school and if you weren't in the ""cool kids group"" then you were no one and disregarded."
PetSmart,1btao9pgcak8ma3a,2.0,"Petsmart management runs on favoritism. If you suck up to the boss then you have more of a chance of moving up, this includes throwing co-workers under the bus. The job is beyond stressful and will take a toll on home life. You become numb to abuse of animals and managers will show no empathy for sick animals unless a higher up manager is around. If you call in you will be treated terribly the next day you work. It's over all a miserable place to work, the only pro is the bonds you share with animals and the knowledge you learn."
PetSmart,1btajbp9n5nf38u2,4.0,Great job opportunity for anyone who loves pets of any kind. Building relationships with pet parents is the most enjoyable aspect of working at PetSmart.
PetSmart,1btae8r9nb8bpauq,2.0,PetSmart is an okay place to work . Its fast paced and competitive .Grooming dogs is a passion of mine and grooming them as fast as I could was not in my wheel house.
PetSmart,1btaduenjbrfkbal,2.0,This company does not follow it policies and procedures until a tragedy happens. When I started with them I received good training from a veteran store manager. Once I transferred to another store all the rumors I heard I began to see first thing. This area is so broken that they shuffle store managers around like product. District Managers with no people skills when situations are out of control just get transferred. The new Store manager that took over was a complete disaster from the beginning. Could not support my business or get involved until they wanted to replace me. Very untrustworthy and definitely a learning experience. Eventually he was replaced with tons of damage already done. Bright side they do have a lot hourly associates committed to the job. The best dog trainer in the valley. Great salons associates. It's truly a one stop shop for customers.
PetSmart,1bta679rbaqglc2r,4.0,"I was lucky enough to work at the Woodbury, MN PetSmart location (store 467) - and had a flexible and supportive boss. At the store level, there is a ton of respect and power given to the employees in regard to initiative and problem solving. The managers oversaw scheduling and ordering, but we had a lot of input. Especially in the grooming salon and Pet Care where the employees were considered the experts and were given control of how to meet their department's requirements - within reasonable parameters."
PetSmart,1bt8kipb1ak8mcor,4.0,"Fun place to work with animals. Good managers, very fair. Unfortunately could not advance or become full-time so I had to make the hard choice to leave."
PetSmart,1bt832bfu1d0g40b,5.0,Great advancement for employees wonderful atmosphere good benefits. Great training and great organization   Great rescue and pet opportunities to help rescue homeless pets

PetSmart,1bt7ufrku5nb5a7a,3.0,if you love animals this is something to start with. but if you need money this job isnt the right choice. i would say only do it if you love animals and you have a passion for animals.
PetSmart,1bt7udqkbas0nanp,5.0,"I really enjoy working at PetSmart. I work in the grooming salon as a bather and even though the job is tough it is very rewarding and I love the dogs so much. It is truly a pleasure going into work. The only issue that I have with work would be the amount of pay I get versus my travel expense. Both of these are of no fault of PetSmart. When I first started there I was living close to the store, but due to school I had to move and now am 40+ miles away, being paid a little over minimum wage an hour for part-time work is not enough to sustain me in my daily life."
PetSmart,1bt68f8hn5nenavp,3.0,I was relocated and not asked or consulted about is. 1.5 house commute each way.
PetSmart,1bt5r40cb1ah35gd,4.0,"Very fast paced. Time-consuming and detail orientated. Learned a lot about different dog breeds, coats, behaviors. Have to be able to work well as a team. Time management was one of the hardest parts of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the transformation the dogs went through when they were in our care."
PetSmart,1bt5gjoag1ba72ri,2.0,I had a bad time at PetSmart when it came to personal issues they were so rude and not understanding. the girls always tried taking your dogs so they had more dogs with more money
PetSmart,1bt5bmjd41ba7252,4.0,"Petsmart is a very fun place to work. It is great if you are an animal lover who likes to be moving constantly and always want something to do. The only issue is there is too much to do and never enough time, employees, or pay. Burning out is fairly common."
PetSmart,1bt586jnm1ahn4ip,3.0,Working there was always working up a sweat. It always felt like a huge part of the day was just stocking the bags of food and there was no satisfaction doing it. It does help lose weight though!
PetSmart,1bt4uff2l1ai90vj,1.0,Managers like to play with your hrs  give you a impossible work list to get done in 4 hrs. Treat you very unfairly very underpaid and very hostel environment to work in
PetSmart,1bt2t7lsq1ba7633,5.0,"Caring for and cleaning up after visiting pets, Hardest part of the job was making great connections with each pet and them having to leave, very structured company with great caring and mature people."
PetSmart,1bt2sdarb5nencpo,1.0,Dangerous and quick paced. You don't receive benefits as a pet bather. The salon is small so there is hardly any room to move around in. Not a great choice.
PetSmart,1bt1ao9vib8becrm,2.0,"I wouldn't recommend working for this company. I was bit really bad and they had me work instead of recouping, even though I couldn't bend or lift or pivot. And I was in tears driving my self to work. They said I would have to take the time off with no pay, even though I got bit working at the Pets Hotel. Wish someone would have warned me that this is something that happens at this company."
PetSmart,1bt0vcsep1ah30l6,5.0,Good place to work for part time work for extra money
PetSmart,1bt0q7th6b87sef0,3.0,Fast paced and sometimes stressful mentally and physically. Helps if you make friends with the people you work with. You help them they help you in the long run.
PetSmart,1bt0inmj3b87sfau,1.0,This is the worst job ever! Never have i felt that i wasnt wanted by my employers. they do not treat you right. they want you to do extra work but you dont get paid for your time
PetSmart,1bt08tkacb8be8ll,2.0,"Starter job, no room to advance quickly, pay is less than offered at local fast food establishments.  Pay raises not acceptable, discussing pay leads to termination."
PetSmart,1bt033ndu52uqdpq,1.0,"It sucks. I liked working with animals but it's your typical huge corporation tomfoolery constantly. They don't care about their people on the store level, the higher ups are only concerned with making their meaningless metrics look better for their region, regardless of what ridiculous hoops it makes the store jump through."
PetSmart,1bsuao9aubrfbahh,3.0,"a GREAT company to work for before they were bought in 2015 and went private.. HEART,SOUL,  and CARE for associates quickly left the culture. unfortunately, great leaders left the business from the top down,forced out or reorganized restructured out.  If you have a passion for pets this was the place to be in retail. Retail has changed it just took Petsmart a little longer to fall in line with everyone else."
PetSmart,1bstp17dn1bg74os,1.0,It's a sinking ship full of the worst management. Avoid it at all costs. They care only about their bank accounts. They will lie and give false promises.
PetSmart,1bstcnluf1ba76nt,3.0,"Working at PetSmart was overall fairly easy and relaxed. However, I did not like how the animals were treated sometimes. It was very difficult to work with people who did not seem to care at about animal well fare, specially managers. Also, at times there was a shortage of employees; I was constantly asked to stay late."
PetSmart,1bstcjibjakgi9gs,5.0,I loved my job at petsmart didn't want to leave but I had to because I had a baby. But if I had the chance to go back I would go back to work for petsmart.
