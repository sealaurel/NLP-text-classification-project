Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1f7pj7ur6o25r800,1.0,If you're not looking to advance within the company then that is just fine. Management always goes on and on about how everyone is replaceable so just do your job and you won't be noticed or bothered. If you're just trying to make some extra money then this is a good place to work.
Safeway,1f7mu1no7n59q800,3.0,"Having worked in a few departments at Safeway, I can say that the environment is a steady on where you don’t get stressed out, but there’s also usually enough going on to not be bored. The pay is fair for what you do, and there are a lot of great coworkers and most of the managers are great too. There are also opportunities for job advancement and increased pay. They can however be very limited with their scheduling flexibility, and sometimes ask you to stay late or come in on short notice."
Safeway,1f7mr7ie7o2h9800,3.0,"Safeway is a reasonable company to work for, the pay benefits and work environment are par for the course when compared to most big box or grocery store chains in the USA. However just as with most other big corporations you will be reliant on your management being proactive and compassionate people if you have any concerns or individual needs that affect your employment."
Safeway,1f7m74e6no20t800,3.0,"It’s an alright job for someone who’s looking for first time job. But don’t expect anything fantastic. Some positions are enjoyable to do, others is not."
Safeway,1f7kl611nu3hk800,1.0,Our store had absolutely abysmal store management. Terrible schedule-makers and awful communication. Everyone hated their lives working here and I was glad to be gone when I quit.
Safeway,1f7jv49sbnq24800,1.0,Management sucks hours are all over the place I wouldn’t work here actually looking for new work. Only good thing is coworkers that aren’t management  it’s just not for someone that is looking for full time work because they will not give you that very stingy with hours but oh wait but they will bug you a lot on your days off to come in and cover a shift honesty my advice is don’t work at grocery business it sucks!!
Safeway,1f7jt74hso14k800,3.0,"Flexible with school schedules. Work part time, get called in at times. Working with customers and other employees all the time. Good for starting to work."
Safeway,1f7irpg1mo20r800,2.0,all the staff and clerks were very kind and welcoming and if they werent they were bearable. the problem is with management as well as lack of hour flexibility and attentiveness which is what they promised during the hiring process. lack of understanding or attention was given to me via management and i was trained poorly in my department and then criticized for not being able to progress even though i essentially taught myself how to do everything on my own. i also notice that they are doing this to other workers as well.
Safeway,1f7i2okdto1nd800,4.0,Safeway is a good starter job as I did for myself.
Safeway,1f7hchm75o1nd800,4.0,"This was a great place to work overall. Fellow courtesy clerks were supportive, friendly, and fun. The day went by quickly because it was always really busy."
Safeway,1f7gfprj9o20r800,3.0,Good place to work.  I enjoyed it the time I was there. Decent management with flexible hours and fun people to work with.  I loved the customers who came in the store.
Safeway,1f7c0cl3po20r800,3.0,Good job for benefits but pay raises don’t happen often been there 4 years and barley got a raise in my 3rd year
Safeway,1f7bth2h0o20r800,4.0,They really appreciate it when you go the extra mile and I love it when you work overtime and any complaints are always willing to listen to your problem and willing to back you when you need to be backed
Safeway,1f79f0q82o20r800,1.0,Been with this company for 18 years and it just keeps going down hill! Managers make a couple dollars above minimum wage. The turn over is insane because of the pay and they like to over hire due to the turnover so you won’t get many hours unless you want to cover people calling in sick daily. You don’t get any benefits unless you stick it out for a year. Training hours over the years have been cut down to nothing and labor hours cut as well. Honestly work anywhere else!
Safeway,1f792fafho1nd800,4.0,Not a bad Job regardless of what others say! My co workers were easy to work with so it made the Job fun to work at ! The store manager was cool & friendly & helpful
Safeway,1f774br7s3obs000,4.0,"I was a courtesy clerk, it was my first job, and it was a good first job. Typical day at work you sweep, clean bathrooms, take out trash, bag groceries, get carts, help customers."
Safeway,1f75cf4kf31ha000,1.0,"Management has no idea how to manage, and just hang out in the back room or outside smoking. Coworkers are lazy and have no clue how to do their job even when you help/explain to them how to do their job and think your being mean. If you don’t hang out and chit chat with management/coworkers they view you as being mean and try to get you fired."
Safeway,1f75carato1dh800,1.0,"Work anywhere else!! Horrible management and poor work ethic is rewarded as long as you kiss a**. Signed on as full time employee, 36-40 hours/ week, only scheduled for under 20 every week. I was constantly told that the store was over staffed and got sent home. Why how more people is your over staffed to begin with?? Don't waste your time or energy."
Safeway,1f70jtl3lo1dh800,5.0,I have worked for Safeway twice. Once in 2016 and again  in 2020. Once as an asst mngr in produce and the second time as a cashier. Both times I enjoyed my time there. It was just bad timing. The first time I had to move out if state. The second time I got a much better paying job and had no choice but to take it.  But I'd go back again one day if they'll let me
Safeway,1f70i0bvbs9vq800,3.0,"I like customer service, but the pay and responsibilities don’t match up. You have to pay union dues even if you don’t want to be apart of the union. The late and early scheduling is hard."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1f6t7n45bo1dh800,2.0,"A typical day as a courtesy clerk would look fine if it weren't for the ridiculous need for us to clock in every time we sweep the store. If anything, having to clock in made it more likely for me to sweep less than more, as the literal clocking in process took more energy overall than the sweep of the store did. I also managed to learn just about nothing while working there."
Safeway,1f6s3pcmos9vq800,5.0,"This job was a slog honestly, but for a first time job, it was alright. I only signed up to be a deli clerk, as in only work the counter. I ended up working fryers as well which I hated. I had early morning shifts or closing shifts, I hated it. What made the job awesome were the people, not the job itself. For those on the East Coast, Safeway is a Publix equivalent."
Safeway,1f6q5jrqno1dh800,4.0,"Days are pretty repetitive but that's what you get when you work in a grocery store. I liked my management but some of the co-workers can be obnoxious because it is a minimum wage job,"
Safeway,1f6nknve7hijp800,2.0,The department managers were cool but this job was not satisfying at all. The pay was poor this is a job for someone who’s really young or someone who’s really old. Even working for many years you don’t get a raise and your hours always change one week you barely work hours the next week you work a decent amount
Safeway,1f6lnck49o26r800,3.0,"I wouldn’t necessarily recommend the job, but it’s not horrible. The pay isn’t great but the job is simple and most the people that work there are nice."
Safeway,1f6gcrs5jt4nb800,3.0,"I only worked there for a couple of weeks due to a death and family responsibilities conflicting with the schedule, I told the manager about my situation and was trying to see if they could change the schedule to make it more flexible or have me come back when the situation would be solved but they seemed mad and just accepted the resignation, making that my last day. Other than that, the people I worked with were pretty cool and chill, and it was hard work but it was somewhat enjoyable."
Safeway,1f6dajecho21m800,1.0,Will never shop in a Safeway. Horrible treatment of employees. Had 3 different store managers in one calendar year. All treated you the same oppressing rules and guidelines and attitude.
Safeway,1f6b3pj0oo21m800,3.0,fine place to work when you need a job. experience definitely depends on the location and store you work at. different departments within company to try out.
Safeway,1f683ssvmo1gm800,1.0,"Lousy work environment, scheming employees. Work itself was ok but the expectation of a  day of work was too much. i recommend finding another employer before settling here..."
Safeway,1f67tgrpeo21m800,4.0,"I love retail, just hate the hours.  Safeway is a great place to start a career in retail.  They have many opportunities to grow within Safeway and will also pay for education."
Safeway,1f65td8s2u3a7800,1.0,"Work hard, get yelled at, work hard some more. Make sure you like working holidays and terrible hours. You will be paid BELOW minimum wage for the first month."
Safeway,1f65krldio1gm800,4.0,"Not bad for a first job, customers can be annoying sometimes. If you are looking for a reliable job, Safeway is the place to go! I would recommend this job to anyone willing to put in the work."
Safeway,1f64etbiso1gm800,3.0,"This was my first job and it’s a great place to start. But you do way more than advertised. A courtesy clerk does the basic things like bag groceries, get carts, and do carry outs. I didn’t know that I would practically be running the store. You can get overwhelmed very quickly with the 10 million tasks they ask you to do in your short shift and management never communicates, so one person will tell you to do one thing and then another will tell you the opposite, this can lead to you getting in trouble or looking bad. Customers are usually elderly people or middle aged women and it’s a 50/50 chance they’ll give you attitude and yell at you or praise you and be kind. The liquor cabinet was a terrible experience and the main reason i quit, too many old men being creepy to an underaged girl. People who shop at Safeway tend to feel entiltled and are usually very lazy people, so they act like you’re some robot programmed to work there with no feelings and demand you do things for you rather than talk to you normally. I will say the employee discount is nice and my coworkers were enjoyable."
Safeway,1f646ru0knpfv800,4.0,The work itself is very easy especially if you're a people person. If the opportunity arises take the chance to work in other departments to see what you like.
Safeway,1f63jgm8pnpr0800,2.0,Constant nights of stocking with a under staffed group of people. Just make this temporary don't think a career will make out of this. Safeway was dreadful to say the least.
Safeway,1f627gkvvnpfv800,1.0,"Management was terrible at every level. I had the workload of three people, but was barely paid well enough for one. My coworkers while nice were not to be trusted as sucking up to the boss at every opportunity is the only way to keep your job no matter how good at it (the work) you are."
Safeway,1f61j6qd6o1mh800,1.0,"Don’t recommend. Quit only after a month, manager had unrealistic expectations and just a bad attitude. It was a very toxic and stressful work environment. Barely had any training days before being pushed on my own then ridiculed for not knowing how to do certain things when I was never showed or only showed once."
Safeway,1f60o2npau1bv800,3.0,I enjoyed my time with safeway. It was fun. Being crossed trained made the job interesting. Never a dull moment. Its not always the same. If you have a problem with a rude cutomer or employee they address it immediately. I feel that the hardest part of the job is the rude customers. You still have to be polite and not lose control of your attitude.
Safeway,1f60dt3q7hiin800,2.0,There's some great people who work her however communication is terrible. Favoritism and negativity is a huge problem here. There is a sense of never being good enough you're asked to preform one way and then the next week the way you are working is not the right way and that's because the communication of the never ending change happens
Safeway,1f5ucegcoo1kn800,4.0,"A typical work day consisted of bagging groceries, sweeping store, pushing carts, and shelfing maintenance. Our location had 1 hour blocks for each of the 4 tasks listed above. Very stress-free job with tons of customer interaction."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1f5tsmv8m308d000,1.0,"I was offered the liquor manager position in August of 2019, and took it with no raise. I had to threaten leaving to get a one dollar raise above minimum wage for the position. Which includes being the sole employee responsible for an entire Safeway wine and spirit section. This included stocking product, ordering product, and maintaining displays. Upper level management consistently visits stores and only offers criticisms, many of which are things that are direct result of their decisions. For example, management auto shipped a significant amount of product that could not fit on the shelf to the store, and when the management viewed the store they commented on the level of back stock. very few people ever get 40 hours a week, and it is not guaranteed. To get close to a full time amount of work, an employee must have completely open availability. Schedules are often changed with little notice, and are made weekly, on Sunday to Saturday intervals. It was very common to not know when you work for a coming Sunday until the Thursday before. extremely high turn over rate, which leads to easy promotion, often with little to no training. I received a 30 minute unscripted walk through with the director as my training for the manager position. never received any praise for my work, despite always beating previous years sales, and projections."
Safeway,1f5te5rivu4lu800,1.0,They want you to make a career out of having no life. Work you six days a week.  Fire older employees.    Cut your time.  No set schedule.    Constantly renegotiate union contracts to take away your benefits.
Safeway,1f5sdqcba308d000,5.0,Driving and delivering groceries for Safeway is very enjoyable. This is a Union job with great benefits. The pay could be better but we get lot's if overtime.
Safeway,1f5pa622ou3af800,4.0,"I initially worked as a cashier, when management found out that I have accounting"
Safeway,1f5mpv33vu4lu800,4.0,Just started working here got it's pros and cons like any other job. Have to pay for a union fee since Safeway works for the union. Wanted to see the other reviews
Safeway,1f5lnefo9o1kn800,2.0,"This is a minimum wage job. This is a consistent job with room for advancement if that’s what you want, but most people that work there really dislike it."
Safeway,1f5hfs6dtu2n1800,2.0,"fine for short term, they value too much on seniority not whos better at the job. if you want to spend your whole life for a job this one's for you, they have very good benefits for long term workers ."
Safeway,1f5ef58i7308d000,2.0,The management did not seem to care to hear employees suggestions. Very few benefits and did not feel valued by Safeway management. Company only seemed to care about what was best for them and not for the employees. Seldom got to take breaks.
Safeway,1f5eeiudco1kn800,5.0,"Honestly, this was the most warm & inviting retail company I ever worked for. I felt like the job really nurtured your abilities to help you grow & be the best person & worker you could be."
Safeway,1f5edtdgo308d000,4.0,"Pay could be better but overall I like my job, you don’t really have to deal with customers 80 percent of the time. You get to move around all day as opposed to standing in the cashier section. Join the union and you’ll have job security so no worries of being fired which I like. Job is definitely not flexible though, they will often forget your responsibilities as a student but if you talk to your managers they will make accommodations. Hours really vary if you are not in stocking Or produce. Moving up will probably take a bit of time but the people around are extremely friendly. Everyone gets to know everyone. Of course there are some fake people in the bunch just be careful who you trust."
Safeway,1f5ebo0tesaai800,1.0,The store I worked at. Expected the moon and more from us. Management was on us constantly with about things out of our control. New people were often compared to multi year veterans in the deli department as if they should be able to work at the same place despite being here for under a month.
Safeway,1f57c3nhssaai800,5.0,Safeway is a great place to work.  I had plenty to do to keep you busy.  And one thing about the job is that it can keep me busy . Its just the management sucks . I've had 3 managers the time I was there.
Safeway,1f56g5ot7u3af800,3.0,"People you work with can be lots of fun, but if you aren't part of the union, management tries to screw you over. Hard to switch departments within the store and some of the customers can be super annoying to deal with. Pretty meh."
Safeway,1f54vnd36sa39800,2.0,"The duties of a Courtesy Clerk is basic house chores, some co workers are helpful and can work as a team, but there were those who weren't. Management always took the side of the checkers or other Courtesy Clerks when something bad happened. I liked working the swing shift because I was able to get more stuff done."
Safeway,1f54gu99io1kn800,2.0,"Everyone at my store seems like they don’t care  about their job and there are a lot of slackers, you usually see a lot of people doing nothing, and there’s little if any hours to go around"
Safeway,1f51hnla1o1kn800,3.0,"The people itself were great. Hardly no problems with coworkers. Sure, a majority were lethargic. Hours were decent, but you didn’t have a full time job unless you advanced your career. Advancement rarely took place. Pay raise was not by much. You work at a grocery store; expect customers to be unruly sometimes. Management was absolutely terrible. Barely have hours, and didn’t do anything if you had problems with coworkers constantly calling out and calling you in. You work for a union. Expect everyone to be protected, even those who shouldn’t work."
Safeway,1f50svfq0u2n1800,3.0,"Fun place to work just poor management, safety cookout for lunch once in a while, coworkers very helpful and positive attitude, safety's big there and organized"
Safeway,1f4roi5ro2v6h000,1.0,"The store manager as well as the Deli and Bakery are terribly managed. The store manager doesn't listen to his employees, doesnt know how to utilize his employees strengths and weaknesses. Scheduling is irratic and unpredictable. Staff is generally morose,  highly underpaid and underappreciated."
Safeway,1f4q6mndb2v72000,3.0,I was not properly trained to be a cashier. And then they made me a lead in their new Drive Up and Go dept (online grocery pick-up). That dept was understaffed and I didn't get enough help when it was busy. Hard to get lunches and breaks covered too. Then they cut my hours to part-time and I had to look for another job.
Safeway,1f4o4rleasa8r800,3.0,"Big company, over 2200 stores total.  Good and bad, you will get the big-time experience you are looking for but at a cost.  Salary is lower than scale for IT positions and advancement opportunities are limited."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1f4nuhfdd2v72000,4.0,"The company treated me fairly, and I enjoyed my time there. There were some managers and employees who were awful, but most of them either left or were fired. They were flexible with my time, and paid me well. Hardest part was that we were often understaffed, and that it got really slow at times. But the being in the work environment was fun and comfortable, and we all had a good sense of comradery."
Safeway,1f4mo662u2v6h000,2.0,"My Supervisor continually embarrassed employees and talked down to them in front of co-workers (Union representatives said they could do nothing since the union represented both of us. Management ignored situation, and told me to go to Human Resources. Human Resources did nothing to help the situation. On the other hand the other supervisors were great. No raise after 2 years of employment."
Safeway,1f4ijq27dsa8r800,4.0,"As the review summary suggested, grocery stores can be busy sometimes, and when it gets really busy, things can get hectic. Since it's a grocery store, people come and people go. This is true for both employees and customers. Your work experience will largely be dependent on the area you live in."
Safeway,1f4i1sdoe2v72000,2.0,Very poor training and support. The weekly schedules are put out only 5 days in advance. Vacations not approved in a timely manner. Impossible to get a consistent schedule.
Safeway,1f4g233al2v6h000,3.0,My work experience is good I have been at Safeway six years and I feel its a decent place to work. I think it's a good place to make a career out of.
Safeway,1f4fs9iaru392800,1.0,"Poor management and poor training along with not enough pay for the amount of responsibilities management tries to get you to do. They often hire only part time and then work way over full time hours with no benefits. No overtime pay, holiday pay. They also believe money and the business is more important than family or religious views."
Safeway,1f4fgh0882v6h000,4.0,"The new COO seems to be embracing a more healthy corporate engagement. Pandemic bonuses, longevity bonuses, better access to behavioral health through insurance."
Safeway,1f4eua0eku39f800,3.0,It was all good biggest thing was the customers just time them out you know no favoritism that I seen I don’t know how as just thier to  and go home b
Safeway,1f4d97v842v6h000,4.0,I like it. Get up early and prepare fruit. Getting up early can be gard but you get used to it and meet new people. Zero customer interaction which is good. Still have rest of afternoon off after working the typical 8 hour shift.
Safeway,1f4cej65b2v6h000,2.0,It's like being thrown into a cage of snakes and trying to focus on your task. Not to mention they always call and interrupt home life... Just overall a place for people who don't cate about themselves.
Safeway,1f4b5l13v2v6h000,3.0,"Was delivery driver. Pretty much basic arrived at store get your truck keys, manifest  and route phone load up your totes with groceries inside and delivered groceries. Scheduled days and nights."
Safeway,1f4a9njl7u392800,4.0,"Not too bad, easy going for the most part. It's a grocery store so it's not too complicated. Can get a little busy and short handed but you get some job security being with the union. Easy to request days off and call in when needed."
Safeway,1f47buncas7ju800,4.0,"Quite good for start,  but not much advancement for diligent employees, pay is rather good, but no on the job training, bonuses are quite good too soMETIMES"
Safeway,1f46rfpvonpee800,1.0,I started during the pandemic when I lost my
Safeway,1f40jfc61npjm800,5.0,Constantly changing with seasonal and holidays. Never a dull moment. Make sure and hire the best candidates to fill supervisor roles and take the time to invest with the associates in order to make a difference.
Safeway,1f3ur1nuunpee800,3.0,Management has a few good ones but overall lacking. Big businesses is always about the bottom line. Co workers are great. Hourly rate could be more for the amount of work to be done.
Safeway,1f3ssq8a4s7ju800,4.0,Safeway was a fun place to work part-time only!!! Was able to take off when I needed to and was able to pick up hours easily! Coworkers gossip which brings a lot of drama! Management was cool and fair! Pay was ok but needs to be increaesd
Safeway,1f3soaiihnpee800,5.0,This is a great company to work for but they were bought by Albertsons since I worked for them. I also worked in a union when I worked for this company. This is why I had great benefits and pay.
Safeway,1f3rnbo9anpjm800,3.0,"This is a standard retail job, which means the pay won't be great and you won't feel like you're going anywhere after the first year. Stress is moderate to high, depending on customer volume. My biggest complaint is that the company has chosen the strategy of having mostly part time employees so that they can avoid giving out full-time benefits, which leads to a high turnover rate and employees who aren't very good at their jobs. If the position you've applied for says full time, don't trust it. Safeway is a decent place to work if you're still in school or live with other people who are drawing an income. If you don't fit that description, look for other opportunities."
Safeway,1f3rnb7b2npee800,3.0,"Corporate cares about their bottom line and nothing else. You are a money-maker, not a human, and are given the stink-eye for taking breaks, drinking water in the departments is not allowed (but of course you can't take a break to drink it either), overtime is frowned upon, but they expect you to get the same amount of work done as you do when you work 10 hours. Just don't do it to yourself."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1f3qq65h9npee802,4.0,It has been 5 years since I quit this job. But I still remember it as being a productive place to work in. The pay wasn't all that great. In fact the pay was way too little
Safeway,1f3o7olkjo2a8800,3.0,"when comparing to other retail jobs, it's actually quite cushy. but retail in general is becoming more and more unbearable with COVID shots etc so I'd go somewhere else if given the opportunity."
Safeway,1f3mngh4ho2a8800,5.0,Loved this place I worked for so many years and continue my loyal service with them.. I completely agree with a lot of different situations that would help me grow within this company..
Safeway,1f3mlteq0ocr1800,5.0,Life is what I make it really bathtubs location do your work and go home schedule was well balanced life wrangle oretttg fair bit if cigdrse favored was the key get
Safeway,1f3jkqtlv3guf000,1.0,My time  at Safeway was ok but then then got really petty to all the full timers  all the write up for little  things like a minute  late an calling in
Safeway,1f3ipepo9u3dj800,3.0,Working as a cashier here makes me feel important and needed on the team. Management are always available to help. The customers can be a bit rude or nasty sometimes but there's always a nice one right after to make it better.
Safeway,1f3hdmvucu3bc800,3.0,"Starbucks is not stressful at all under good management.  The pay is very low though and once you are capped ,you get no more raises which suck. Not alot of advancement opportunities"
Safeway,1f3g8futvo2a8800,4.0,If your close to the managers then you have easier time of moving up. Huge turn over with employees that leave because they though work was going to be easy
Safeway,1f3e25mh2u3dj800,1.0,They only wanted to give me 16 hours a week. At minimum wage this is definitely not liveable or kind. No training. Rude customers. Forced lunch breaks even on a short shift.
Safeway,1f3divvgno29g800,5.0,"Will work with you easily involving any scheduling changes that you may need. Good management team in place, great teamwork structure amoungst employee's"
Safeway,1f3c03tfoo29g800,2.0,It got good people but it's not a fun place to work. I love to work somewhere else. The work is hard but the paid isn't that great that can motivate people to stay there
Safeway,1f378asbp309g000,3.0,"Easy, typical grocery's job, good training, but some seasoned coworkers can be critical. Tough to move up. Overall it's a low stress job and good for student. I loved being part of the union."
Safeway,1f36tad78him2800,3.0,Depending on the store you work in you'll either have really good management or horrible management but wherever you are be prepared to work your butt off.
Safeway,1f33bgdf8him2800,3.0,"Compared to chains, grocery pharmacy's a walk in the park. Having said that, often times it becomes too bland. Ok for those who like that kind of pace"
Safeway,1f30vmc2j3ki8000,5.0,I love working at Safeway The company is great has great benefits. They work with your availability and there is always room for learning new things.
Safeway,1f2vlf8tj309g000,1.0,I was haired on spot. No training whatsoever I was thrown into working automatically. I was expected to do so many things I didn’t know at all. Id ask how to do certain things or ask for help and just get attitude or get ignored :/
Safeway,1f2uvb0ib309g000,1.0,"Highly recommend NOT working for this company. Lacking everything important needed for a strong , healthy environment. Pay is not equal to amount of work you will put in."
Safeway,1f2u5cp5pu1v3800,3.0,"Overall, the management seeks to improve their productivity and their bonuses by fudging the numbers about people working over time and threats if you are trying to complete a task that requires your full attention. They believe that you should clock out before you aquire any overtime and then return to your area if responsibility to give a good turnover to the oncoming shift about the project you were working on to be finished by the oncoming shift. Giving turnover is considered WORK!!  WHO CARES IF YOU HAVE TO STAY ON THE CLOCK A FEW MINUTES TO GIVE TURNOVER TO A SHIFT THAT CAN'T CLOCK IN EARLY."
Safeway,1f2t04gfq309g000,3.0,"This job is busy. You spend a lot of time walking around the store while sweeping, facing shelves, returning groceries, and collecting carts. Sometimes the close shifts can been stressful because there are so many responsibilities, but the other courtesy clerks are helpful and most of the managers are reasonable about expectations on a busy night. Much of what you do as a courtesy clerk is repetitive, but it's good exercise."
Safeway,1f2snefp22v5r000,1.0,Director and assistant don’t address any issues brought to them. There are a lot of favoritism there. No team work. Everyone on their own. No communication on what’s going on.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1f2s60p3gu1v3800,1.0,"Some people work, others don't and those that do, do more. Some are late 90% of their shifts, leaving the work for those who show up on time. Some call of once every week or every other week, and those who are there pick up the slack. Do you get paid for doing the work of the slackers, call offs and late arrivals? Of course not."
Safeway,1f2qdu0t3him2800,2.0,"Generally do not get two days off in a row but work 5 days a week for 16-20 hours a week,Have open availability and still mostly do not get more than 20 hours a week. One day you come in at 6: am the next day your scheduled at 6:00 pm or an overnight shift. No reason to do that to melters."
Safeway,1f2q3vo0g2v5r000,3.0,"This job is great for people who just need a job to pass time, or to build up your resume very slightly. Upper management is terrible with hours constantly changing and empty promises left and right. I would not recommend moving up into management, they will tell you about a raise and never give it to you. And if you need a full time job with consistent hours forget it, they will work you 40 regardless if you want to or not and then drop you to 20 the next week regardless if thats what you want or not."
Safeway,1f2ps2uiv309g000,3.0,Decided to work here as an in between job right out of highschool. been here 5 years. Its not a horrible place to work. You get to meet a lot of people. I only recommend long term at this company if you plan to move up!
Safeway,1f2o1va61309g000,2.0,"I worked as a courtesy clerk for about half a year and in that little time many other courtesy clerks quit and then I finally quit myself because I finally understood why. The job itself as a courtesy clerk just sucks, you have to do all the dirty work no one wants to do such as moving carts in bad weather which was very exhausting and uncomfortable, you also have to clean the public bathrooms which was always disgusting and you just have to clean up any mess in the store that's made. I was hurt many times while working there and now I have ongoing wrist problems.You also get treated badly by customers and management.The management was lazy and bias and not understanding at all. If you're young, management will definitely take advantage of you and assign you bad shifts, they would make me move carts for three hours straight in the rain while others weren't assigned to do carts at all that day. Some coworkers are nice but there were some that made me uncomfortable. I also wasn't getting very many hours, I was getting about 8 hours a week and the little pay I was getting was just not worth dealing with what I had to. You have to deal with rude customers, management, coworkers, and gross cleanups. Only work here if you don't have to be a courtesy clerk."
Safeway,1f2nefgq6309g000,4.0,This was during covid and was not bad. Drive up and go was my favorite part because it was independent l. Overall a solid job. My coworkers were great as well
Safeway,1f2mptv2c309g000,1.0,"Work there for eight years, it was cool in the beginning as a first job. But than management changed over and it really sucked. Only plus is the benefits."
Safeway,1f2mnv0cehim2800,3.0,"If you just love to put your head down and do the job given. This is the job for you. The harder you work, the more work they give you."
Safeway,1f2mn4bg5u1v3800,1.0,"This job is an utter nightmare. When I started working there in October I was given a pretty simple schedule probably 16-20 hours a week. When I started to work there for longer they started to schedule me for 16-20 hours just over the weekend and not spread out along the week. This often changes between shifts but it is normal to work 8 hour shifts on each weekend day. The management is poor, to the extent of which you get written up or docked for talking to coworkers, but the managers who write you up are also talking and completely distracted most of the time. Also DO NOT WORK HERE IF YOU ARE UNDER 18. The managers are completely ageist and they believe that if you are a minor you should do their work for them on top of your duties. Also you make minimum wage as a minor which I didn’t know because they never told me how to access my paychecks until I had to ask on my 3rd or 4th day. I think that they choose not to tel minors what the pay is in order for them to secure the job. Also you have to join the UFCW 7 (The local Union) as a minor. Which takes $15 a week out of your paycheck. So technically you aren’t even making minimum wage you are making closer to 10-11 dollars an hour. Also more recently they hired to many Courtesy Clerks and everyone has 6-12 hours a week. They also have no warning to any of us about the recent hourly cut. Overall I would never work here again, I would never recommend this job to anyone. I hope I can find another job so I can be done with this one."
Safeway,1f2ldp5lu3h8b000,4.0,It was a great overall experience  just my manager was micromanging and hard to work with. As a whole it was great learning experience. Learned alot about produce and customer service.
Safeway,1f2kalafr309g000,3.0,I worked at Safeway for 8 years give it take and I personally loved it the only reason of my leaving was my pay was horrible other then that it was a great place.
Safeway,1f2fqsfjl2v5r000,1.0,"Safeway is probably the worst place i've ever worked, i've been here a year and i see nothing but rotating doors for all my fellow bottom of ladder hourly workers. it's disgusting."
Safeway,1f2d43m5v2v5r000,1.0,"The managers do not care at all about the employees. They do not respect your time and are not willing to let you go home sick, even in a pandemic. They also do not enforce their own mask rules leading to customers putting the employees at risk. They won't train you either, you'll get thrown into full shifts a few days after you start with basically 0 guidance and will get reprimanded or mocked by your coworkers for not knowing instinctively what to do."
Safeway,1f2c09t78u1v3800,1.0,The work is the same every night and if you're not friends with management then forget about getting treated like they care about you. Co-workers are fun to be around.
Safeway,1f273135go1nq800,3.0,Very understaffed. Allowing me to take on the whole deli department most of the time. Would be a good job If there was more staff and nicer coworkers
Safeway,1f262lv8l2v5r000,2.0,"Traditional corporate company with basic benefits. No really outstanding extra perks, and your work environment is dependent on the department you are in."
Safeway,1f25ighf32v5r000,4.0,"I worked as a cashier and it was ok, I only worked part time and it was ok. People can be stressful exspecially when it gets busy, like football sunday or holidays."
Safeway,1f24vr0cqu1v3800,4.0,"Typical workday with Fun. Managment is transpraent , flexible work hours. Most enjoyable part is the team which helps to maintain fun and enthusiasm. overall the best"
Safeway,1f24los99nppi800,5.0,I loved my job there as a cashier. I fell into trouble when I switched to night crew. There was poor management on night shift. If I was able to work there again I would definitely do that.
Safeway,1f23bjtlru1v3800,3.0,This is a good place to work if you’re going to work in retail pharmacy. Other places I have worked are far busier and more stressful. I worked with great pharmacists and felt a strong sense of patient care here. The only cons are the pay and benefits.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1f2367aqrs798800,2.0,"Safeway es una buena compañía para trabajar porque tiene buenos beneficios de salud y retiro,pero el ambiente laboral,es estresante,y había mucho hostigamiento de parte de mis Managers o jefes ,tampoco te promueven luego  luego,a mi me discriminaron,mucho y costó que me promovieran en general esta compañía te ofrece beneficios de seguro médico,y de pensión,no tienes un horario flexible."
Safeway,1f2340l0dnppi800,1.0,They expect you to work to the point of sheer exhaustion yet never make you feel valued for all you give them. I was a well known highly demanded employee with Safeway and wish I never walked in the door. Shame on them.
Safeway,1f210b1662v5r000,2.0,I have worked for this company for almost 30 years. The culture has become more toxic with the high employee turnover and the bottom line being the priority.
Safeway,1f20l90vro15n800,4.0,"This job was a good job to work at, during the peak of the virus, they raised the hourly pay. There is always something to do to keep you busy to do while there."
Safeway,1f2087h6qnph7800,1.0,"GroceryWorksDotCom should really take the time to train their employees better and accurately, instead of standing/sitting around the work space, acting like they know what they're doing, when all they do is just take long extended breaks, talk negative about other grocery workers and leave the work place a mess, having other grocery workers clean up after their mess. They make the delivery drivers wait for a long period to load up their assigned routes in the delivery trucks, leaving the chilled and frozen products, including all raw meats sit outside of the chill box and freezer for more than 10 minutes, after DotCom Shoppers have completed picking the items for delivery. There is no support from management, and requested hours to work for overtime are not approved. I wouldn't suggest nor would I recommend working at Safeway."
Safeway,1f1tlo02qo15n800,4.0,It’s not a bad place to work. Management takes care of issues that arise. You have the opportunity to move up in the company if you voice this is something you are Interested in.
Safeway,1f1spp0jtu40q800,1.0,"Don't respect employees at all they out just for the mighty dollar no matter what it takes. They will work no matter what, don't care if you as an employee has a life or anything important in your life you NEED to be there no matter what."
Safeway,1f1rk6qpbnph7800,5.0,Great starting pay. Great team. Manager work with you on your schedule . Only hard part is you don’t get recognized for hard work very often and get asked a lot of you.
Safeway,1f1nmqlfinph7800,2.0,It’s easy work sometimes. But when it gets busy they expect you to do everything. They used to work me 10 hour shifts with no breaks. No 10s or 30s at all.
Safeway,1f1nj96u0nph7800,4.0,They treated the new and young like they need to do lots when they didn't even learn or just started. Having them do new tasks that doesn't fir the job description
Safeway,1f1mlo0q0nph7800,2.0,"I was constantly yelled at by customers and management would always suck up to them and give out gift cards like candy. Once, I was forced to bring lobster tails to sell at the gas station (in the summer!) by the seafood manager, and the store assistant manager told me to get out when I questioned the safety of that. The seafood manager yelled at me and practically pushed me out of the store to go back to the gas station. The next day, the store manager just treated the whole thing as an 'oopsies' and laughed it off."
Safeway,1f1mlkgeko15n800,2.0,"You don’t get paid well, also they hire people to void spots instead of make you good at your job. If you love being employed by a office who works your life away you found it. Been here for a year and I’m over it."
Safeway,1f1mc878tu3hv800,3.0,"I've learned a lot about this company over the 3+ years I have worked here. I try to conduct myself honestly and with self-respect regardless, but when I first started here I was definitely naive. I would give 100% no exception. I would fix things other people did (or didn't do...) because I wanted my department to operate smoothly and efficiently. One night I even stayed until 2am because the guy came to turn off the freezer so they could clean it the next day. No one had told us of course, but if I didn't move the frozen food into the back, we would have lost thousands in product. I've also done research, and read product manuals on personal time to correct how we were using/cleaning certain appliances."
Safeway,1f1jk6rm3o15n800,2.0,Just started an the manager that interviewed me didn't even know my wage id be making also im supposed to be full time witch typically includes benefits well I have yet to get the paperwork from them aswell as when I try too talk to them about these things they are either too busy or not in when I'm getting off my over night shift an to be honest after a long night of grave shift getting off at 830 in the morning all im thinking about is sleep not sitting around waiting to talk to my management but get paid weekly an a job is a job.
Safeway,1f1jd5g11t4pr800,3.0,"if you are a new hire and don't need a good wage or benefits this is a good fit, you only get full time if you are in management, otherwise 24 hours a week, write ups for overtime"
Safeway,1f1g4ap4ro24s800,2.0,"I started during the pandemic, worked through the busy holiday. Started out fine. Then realized how much the other departments hated dotcom. Other departments are quick to speak badly about you without coming to you first. DM and store managers are not supportive. At least you can pick your shift. Very physical work. Walk minimum 5 miles a shift."
Safeway,1f1eossj8o2it800,5.0,"It is a very good first job. I strongly recommend if you are trying to get the first job Safeway or a local retain shop would be considered as an ""OK"" job. I loved it."
Safeway,1f1eh3c87pi1t800,4.0,"flexible with schedule and good hours. Part-time employees also get benefits which was a great plus. Pretty easy job to keep up with, you do the same thing everyday"
Safeway,1f1egog45n56c800,4.0,If you’re young this is the job for you. Everything is pretty good and the pay is fair depending on what your job title is.
Safeway,1f1daalm1n53l800,4.0,I enjoyed working here because of who I worked with. The company itself was full of rules and regulations. I worked here for eight months and I saw that HR would fire people with little reason. It's a good job if you're looking to get into management. They're always understaffed.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1f1c0p5u6npj1800,2.0,"Working as an online shopper was an interesting experience; you're constantly moving from one section to another pretty quickly, its most likely the best position to familiarize yourself with the store. Be ready to run into dazed and oblivious customers though. Cool and friendly coworkers who really assist in the process of learning the site. Until you reach the manager, constantly being unprofessional, wearing literal HEADPHONES on the site with no care for one's image unless in front of higher-ups. Pay is too little to be consistently moving from one side of the site to the other for over 8 hours with slim breaks. Not to mention, inconsistent scheduling causes major pile-over to people on shifts. My first two weeks in, I ran over 12hour shifts over 4 DAYS. For a veteran worker, this may sound simple but I was only 2 weeks old. I was forced to take on responsibilities I was never even shown to yet. It showed me how unorganized the scheduling really was. Soured my image for the site and its employers, Id rather much stay as a customer"
Safeway,1f1bslvm0t4b9800,1.0,You are just a number to them. U give and give they JUST TAKE. Don’t care about people. After 38 years of service because one new assistant manager doesn’t like you you’re fired. 37 years in the snow never missed a snowstorm except for when I was on maternity leave. I was extremely dedicated. You had to do everything in the whole store except for the big
Safeway,1f1bc876pn56c800,3.0,"My department manager was amazing both as a boss and friend, and is someone who I still talk to. Loved working for her. Because of that, I had some great times at Safeway. But corporate is absolutely awful, they are rude to even their most productive and hardworking people, and don't care about their employees. They'll always be looking for a reason to fire you, and if the union can't protect you they will, over the smallest things too. Plus depending on where you work in the store, the work itself is not very enjoyable. Do not work in the deli! Deli is awful and you work so so much harder than the other departments. If you can, get a job in bakery or produce."
Safeway,1f1altd3cnpj1800,4.0,"Has newer trucks, offload with electric pallet jacks (so manual labor is minimal), most stores have hydraulic dock plates. Management is usually on the driver's side so conflict with stores are minimal"
Safeway,1f17kq2kjn53l800,4.0,"Small town atmosphere, Customers are very classy and happy. Can't please everyone but we give it our best. The best is when customers come in mad and they leave happy."
Safeway,1f16mit6on53l800,4.0,When I was in the pharmacy I was told Safeway would help me become a pharmacy technician. With a pharmacist behind me because of the way I worked I inquired about getting certified the manager at the time said they can not do it at this time. A week later we where told that if we where not certified we would have to leave the pharmacy and they hired two people off the street instead of letting me continue to work and get certified.
Safeway,1f1660re8o1i4800,2.0,"It was a fun place to work because of the employees and customers but the management needs some serious work. Lazy, rude, and simply don’t care about how to improve things. The store is always understaffed so they are always overworking you. I would get called called in so often but when you would try to request any time off it was always denied."
Safeway,1f15abshonpj1800,4.0,"It was a great place to work however, some of the management were hard to work with. Has great pay because it is a union job which offered some job protection."
Safeway,1f140qd48o1i4800,2.0,"I worked inside as a barista and it was the worst barista job i've ever had. low pay, low tips, and people were spending all of their EBT money on expensive Starbucks drinks, meaning my tax dollars were going right back into the corporation in which treated me so poorly. Management was unresponsive to requests for more hours or to move departments and my typically work week was a 20 hour week working 5 days a week on short shifts."
Safeway,1f11jrrptt4q6800,5.0,Cool people to share shifts with. Covid-19 made things challenging. So much hand sanitizer. People are respectful of your break time. Garage gets smelly in the summer.
Safeway,1f0ujipkds7jc800,3.0,Management not fair. High perfoming stores pushed to do more while failing stores not held accountable. Always expected to do more with less  retail but not as bad as cvs or walgreens
Safeway,1f0rn8ep1t4l2800,3.0,One of my first jobs as a teenager and it was as cashier. I have never disliked something more. The pay was minimum and despite having told them my availability they kept for longer shifts.
Safeway,1f0pvdq72o1hv800,4.0,"Very easy job. In charge of organizing store, cleaning bathrooms, and putting away carts. Management and employees are very kind and helpful. I recommend this job."
Safeway,1f0pqc0tj3o8h000,1.0,"They will have you work in every department possible with little to no training. The employees do not enforce the mask mandate and often break it themselves. When a careless coworker gave me Covid-19, they wanted me to come back in before my doctor cleared me. They also don't care about your time, they will have you close one day (at 11pm) and open the next (starting at 5am). This, and so much more, is exactly why they have such a high turnover rate. Save yourself! Find a different job!"
Safeway,1f0pnu6cso1hv800,4.0,Great staff and great savings. Not enough hours for store and poor management Communication between supervisors is not well. Could be more I formed my f things.
Safeway,1f0mbnmvsnpl8800,3.0,Isn't as bad as cvs but not as good as costco. There are metrics and DPMs can still be breathing down your neck about goals. Can be chronically understaffed but what pharmacy isn't?
Safeway,1f0lo3bv7s7jc800,3.0,"A lot of inconsistencies some work weeks you will have 30 hours of work, next week it could be 16 hours. Depending what department you work in the managers are nice and will try to help you succeed and help you with time off when you need it. Overall just have to make it work for you until you find something else. I wouldn’t stay long."
Safeway,1f0knhdtusa7q800,5.0,They are a good company to work for. I would not have left if I did not move. Coworkers are nice & management is helpful. I felt at home & like I mattered.
Safeway,1f0jhpjq3o1hv800,4.0,It's a good job but it is alot of hard labor with mainly one day off so it can be tough on the body other than that it's a union job with great pay an benefits
Safeway,1f0i8lol83o8h000,1.0,management could not care less about the employees safety and health.       Do not give you a consistent work schedule. They stopped limiting the amount of people in the store which is ridiculous because covid is still a thing and the store gets really really packed and then customers get angry and take it out on the checker's and courtesy's. coworkers and managers talk bad about you when you call in or are out on covid leave. Management posts a list of the checkers  name and employee ID numbers with a GS1 score to shame them for not getting above 95%.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1f0hn03bho1hv800,5.0,Safeway is a great job for anyone who wants too work in a place where they can feel really involved in their community. Great management and schedule flexibility are a couple of the things that make this job worth checking out.
Safeway,1f0h87a1unpl8800,3.0,Was a great first job taught me alot about working with money and people also working in very fast past enviormemt when we were busy really helped with customre satisfaction
Safeway,1f0fr77onnq1h800,4.0,"good reliable profession , very physical work. must be able to stand for long periods of time, you will appreciate each and every beak to get off your feet"
Safeway,1f0fc8q4qnq1h800,4.0,This was a perfect job for a teenager who was busy with school work and other activiites.  The company provides decent training and uniforms when you're starting.

Safeway,1f0du29tinq1h800,1.0,This place is like working in the twilight zone! They only give the good hours to their favorite employees! Full of drama! My manager at Starbucks was stealing my tips.
Safeway,1f0cmocnlhiq9800,2.0,but it was an experience so not all negative...will continue to say positive things just too much favoritism and not based on work ethic or work productivity
Safeway,1f0chuif2nq1h800,2.0,"i worked for the .com grocery delivery department. it was a very enjoyable physical outgoing position i enjoyed it very much.  i learned a lot on my 10 years plus in this position.  i thought to myself this is it; i have a secure enjoyable job where i know it will last forever.  not the case!  management abruptly decided in shutting down this department the last day of february.  a poor, unwise, very dumb decision.  leaving thousands of employees without a job.  sure it was easy for management to say ""we will place you inside the company but with lesser salary"".  easier said than done! i am discouraged and outraged about this foolish decision from corparate.  they never did give me a legible logical explanation as to why they suddenly shut down the .com delivery department."
Safeway,1f0aqabe9npfj800,3.0,Poor compensation and poorly managed. Not a place you want to work long-term. That's probably why the turn-over is so high. It can be stressful at times.
Safeway,1f0ak66mjn51j800,1.0,"If you want your license to be in jeopardy it’s a good place to work.  The amount of prescriptions done vs the amount of staff your allowed to schedule, leaves you with about 3 minutes per prescription."
Safeway,1f0abl9kfnq1h800,4.0,"I recently started working as a bakery clerk at my store. So far I'm enjoying my job and getting to know my everyone in my new department(I've worked in 3 other departments in the past 2 years). I used to work in the Jamba Juice kiosk at my store but it recently closed so I had at switch departments. Luckily all the upper management at my store is very supportive and allowed me and my coworkers to choose what department we wanted to work in. As long as you work at a store with management that's supportive(and recognize hard work), work hard for the money you make, and make friends with your coworkers, working at Safeway actually isn't all that bad."
Safeway,1f085jg71306b000,1.0,"My first job at 16 and the worst one I ever had. They will work you to the bone on shift, even the minors, for barely above minimum wage. The managers and CEO do not care about you at all."
Safeway,1f07a1daisa1j800,3.0,I worked in the evening. It took a lot of time to clean up and some of the other employees wouldn't pull their weight so it fell on the rest of us to clean up everything. Management was no help with the situation.
Safeway,1f05qr224306b000,4.0,"I learned some great skills at safeway, baking, customer service, how to work with a team, I just got bored. Overall its a pretty decent job I just need something a little less monotonous. If you're looking for a predictable job with the possibility of overtime then this might be a good fit for you."
Safeway,1f03db1eut458800,3.0,Management was clingy to each other and never listened to other sides of opinions and incidents. They were also rude to customers and made working there a total pain.
Safeway,1f02ubkveu3jt800,3.0,Safeway is a okay first job. But I wouldn’t recommend working here long term. I am not a fan of the lack of communication. Employees get away with things other employees don’t get away with. If you have certain days you’re available to work. They possibly can schedule for the days you can’t work. I hate that you don’t get a constant schedule. Every week you’re scheduled will be all over the place. Some of the people I work with are okay people. I hate that there are some made up rules that you don’t even know if they are true or not. They didn’t give me a employee hand book like they’re supposed to. It would be helpful to know what’s okay to wear and all the rules with being a employee there.
Safeway,1f02aepps304v000,3.0,It's a good place to work at. Great benefits only cons would be you only get a half hour lunch break. If you show up and do your job there's opportunity for raises and advancement.
Safeway,1f00b4idc306b000,3.0,"Safeway is a great place to start out at. Or if one is on the later end of one's working career it's a great place to get benefits. Safeway values a good work ethic but moving up as a career isn't possible unless one is willing to cow-tow to the politics, upper management, and location moves to progress.  Grocers use to be a valued, well paid and respected careers but the Corporations have taken that from the average guy with low pay and lack of support to hardworking employees."
Safeway,1f004m4jt304v000,4.0,"The HMB safeway is the only regular grocery store that’s close enough so that you don’t have to go over the hill, so it was extremely busy all the time. The bosses were okay, coworkers were great. Pretty standard minimum wage job."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1evuecavb304v000,3.0,"This job was a good job to work at, during the peak of the virus, they raised the hourly pay. There is always something to do to keep you busy. The one thing that irritated me the most was pushing carts in the heat. Loved one of the managers there though, the rest, not as much."
Safeway,1evsssmq5n52h800,3.0,"its not a bad place to work, but with the decently low pay and having to pay union dews, a-lot of my paychecks aren’t what they should be as well in order to have benefits and get better pay you need to be there for a while, therefore someone who really cares about their education they are 50/50 with school flexibility and things that come up that are out of your control to where you cant work that day."
Safeway,1evsfef67npn0800,3.0,I worked with some fun people and they worked around my schedule well but management is terrible and don't care to help you grow and succeed. The also hire the laziest employees who show up or no call no show. They don't fire them and have no consequences for them.
Safeway,1evrhdb1locao800,1.0,"I don’t recommend working here for anyone. Management is awful, they do not care about the workers at all, so expect to be mistreated and miserable if you work here. The schedules are never posted on time (and paychecks are also almost always late..) making it hard to even live off the poor salary. Worked for almost 4 years and never got any recognition, raise, and they denied me time off."
Safeway,1evps6u8jocao800,2.0,"I was lead cake decorator for our store and never felt appreciated for the work done. Between filling the cake case, making back up, creating cake orders, filling cream island and freezers and ad tables... It was never enough. And God forbid you have an empty spot come the afternoon. They took hours away yet required the same or more than before. It's never enough. The manager belittles people and makes of the employees. Its a toxic environment. In order to succeed you need to be a yes man. Don't ever speak up about the things that are wrong. This job is physically, mentally and emotionally taxing unfortunately."
Safeway,1evnime8f26a4000,3.0,I worked at the Green Mountain location and unfortunately as wonderful as the workers are the building itself is falling apart and corporate doesn't give us any hours. Also the pay is so slim can't survive on it.
Safeway,1evlurupbocao800,3.0,Working at the bakery in Safeway was relatively relaxed. Occasional reconstructions of the department were done throughout the year which were somewhat stressful. Infrequent interaction with the manager and lack of timely communication with coworkers led to me sending in my resignation.
Safeway,1evkp73i5n52h800,4.0,"Was a good job, with amazing benefits and regular raises as long as you worked your hours. However it is still all customer service based and that can always be a con. As long as you work hard  and have patience with people you will reap the rewards."
Safeway,1evjnjma7s7kr800,1.0,"I have been trying for 5 years to get a raise and have always worked every single holiday including Christmas Day New Year's Day, Thanksgiving. Easter Memorial Day Weekend.  I sometimes get a $5 Thank You card but lately, the management refuses to reward anyone for doing a good job.  We have been cutting hours in our store in anticipation of a new competitor in the neighborhood.  Therefore on many occasions, I have to budget myself on a week-to-week basis and even have to go without meals. We have a defined contribution 401 K plan but there is no employer match.  There is never a chance to get promoted from part-time status to full-time employment and it is really sad that the part-time employees are the most dedicated and hard worrking but never are given even a chance to apply for full time work."
Safeway,1evj8to1hocao800,3.0,"Pretty typical union retail environment, like I said in the title. Coworkers are helpful and have a good sense of humor. Work environment can be tiring with so much walking. Job security and advancement is decent, you can level up your wages quite a bit if you stay for a while."
Safeway,1evgt3nrtnpn0800,3.0,This job is stressful and so dirty and there’s large amounts of covid cases here and everyone has a whatever attitude and it feels like a prison here. Apply somewhere else as the pay may seem good but your own health it’s not!!!
Safeway,1evg0qqofocao800,3.0,"Great gym,"
Safeway,1evdfbd7rnpna800,1.0,If you want to be spied on by ur fellow employees work at Safeway. King rd. store is the store I worked at. Never again!!!
Safeway,1evbks7rk26ak000,5.0,I really liked working at Safeway.  I advanced very quickly. Everyone there was friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend Safeway as a job opportunity.
Safeway,1evbepm1en55l800,4.0,Work is very steady. During this pandemic we stayed open. They reduced the store hours and used precautions such as sanitizer and wipes. Would like to have many more hours though.
Safeway,1ev9dk30enpna800,1.0,Do not apply at this company unless you like getting treated like your yesterdays garbage ( Just Kidding) the managers there treat you like your not important at the company the best part was working with the co workers
Safeway,1ev8tel6unpjs800,1.0,Safeway was my first job when I moved to Oregon. I worked as a Starbucks Barista inside the safeway and I hated going to work everyday. No one cares and managment seem to hate their job. No one is happy. I worked there for 5 months and quit when I found a better place. The pay sucks and the union is so annoying and are pretty much useless.
Safeway,1ev8gmqqut5ho800,1.0,"No work/life balance. They gave you a hard time if you were injured on the job. I was employed there for 25 yrs and was laid off, along with 500 other employees when they decided to close the distribution center. They did not provide resources for employees to seek employment elsewhere like they told the media they would. It was difficult to be promoted. The pay was not fair"
Safeway,1ev8d6p8unpna800,2.0,Negative energy in the work environment. No structure for advancement the negative environment makes for long miserable night shift Overall bad place to work
Safeway,1ev80bk5jnpna800,4.0,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers.  Customers were great for the most part.  Typical of retail,  there were some customers who made the job more stressful than normal."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1ev5t2lhs26ak000,1.0,Management has favorites and doesn't listen to employees. Doesn't accommodate for those that have light duty.  Also the management doesn't care about employees
Safeway,1ev38ntemnpjs800,3.0,I worked here when i was in high school and it was fine but the environment was boring and repetitve. the hiring manager wasnt communicative and the process was slow
Safeway,1ev2sdqcv26ak000,2.0,I got the job as a courtesy clerk/general merchandiser .I’ve trained one day for dug and that was it. I was suspended for coming into contact with someone who tested positive for the corona virus therefore they made me take two weeks off with pay so when I went back to work I was and still to the day I’m doing a two man job by myself it’s like they have me doing all the dirty jobs like cleaning the bathroom that has been dirty all weekend long until I get back to work to clean them up which should have been done before I returned back to work 48 hours later
Safeway,1ev2s9chhnpjs800,1.0,"Benefits are good after a year.  You are worked very hard with no room for error. Most everyone is miserable. Upper management are complete jerks! Hours are,not consistent."
Safeway,1ev1jtgnqn55l800,3.0,Fast pace all they care about is numbers the manager of dry department mark didn’t care about his employees only about the numbers you could pull a 99.9 percent on the week and get fired for it I’ve seen it happen to a man that spend many years with the company show the loyalty they have for the employees
Safeway,1eutt7vh6t5h3800,3.0,"Decent place to work, however, my Safeway was rather disorganized. Hours varied wildly week to week, often I would close by myself, since we were understaffed because of the cut to hours."
Safeway,1eup67m25o15p800,3.0,"I was a student while working here and the management wouldn't adjust my hours to accommodate that, so I ended up leaving. Also there are mandatory Union fees, which doesn't feel great when you're working minimum wage."
Safeway,1eukuon8bo1i6800,5.0,"The managers were fair and the job description was clear. The job was tough because you have to be on your feet for most of the time, but I never felt overworked."
Safeway,1euidl1llo15p800,2.0,The benefit of this job was that they offered you medical even as a part-time employee. What was a struggle was getting hours. A lot of the time our hours were cut and we would be sent home early or told not to come in at all without much notice.
Safeway,1euhu568fo1i6800,4.0,"Worked as a delivery driver in california. One of the main problems was that the equipment essentially sucked, and management had a disconnect with what was going on in field"
Safeway,1euh3v8ddu1ib800,1.0,Mangers doesn't care how they talk to you
Safeway,1eugpeag0u1ib800,4.0,"With the small bit of time I worked there they gave you about a week to learn your part in the department itself and get to know your coworkers, management outside of the deli was kind at the time I worked there and mainly everyone got along and held conversations with each other. If you were lost or stuck there was someone around to help and explain, when time off was needed the upper managers were very open to help. Near the time I left new management came and began to drastically changed the way the store was operated, change the main people who worked when I started in a way that was so fast it was uncomfortable."
Safeway,1euecvgbho1i6800,4.0,"Good place to work, corporate needs to work on communication skills. Employees were great, most customers were good. Product and quality is the best."
Safeway,1eucpin71u1ki800,2.0,"Corporate at Safeway cares only about getting quarterly bonuses. As the bonuses are tied to quarterly profits the incentive is to cut any and all corners to keep cost down. What this looks like is cutting hours, not paying for maintenance on equipment and buildings. My store manager did little but lie and was surrounded by conflicts of interest."
Safeway,1eubvepv6u1ib800,4.0,Started working at safeway my senior year in highschool and left this month due to moving states. I enjoyed it and I believe it is a good place to work when you're young and the pay was good as well. I lived in oregon so minumum wage was better than other state so I thought I was paid fairly. Had good managers so I can not complain.
Safeway,1eubudtsiu1ib800,3.0,"Personally I was that favorite and I got basically anything I asked for. The hours, days off, and promotions to places I wanted to be. But that came at the cost of having my individuality. To get there I had to buckle up and shut up about anything I saw that could be against our unions policy. I saw plenty of other amazing employees face retaliation after standing up for themselves in a mildly toxic workplace. I could go on longer about how pay and benefits have drastically changed for the worse and why new employees are treated even worse but I think the turnover rate speaks for it self."
Safeway,1eu9ev2cko1i6800,3.0,It pays the bills. It is a decent company to work with and I think that it would be nice to have some sort of better management system so we could be more productive.
Safeway,1eu9artbko1i6800,1.0,"I worked in the deli at Safeway and it is hands-down the worst job I ever had, we were constantly understaffed and Still expected to clock out on time when I was the only one left to close and take me an extra two hours to actually clean everything before I left at 1 to 2 AM. Also the union does not look after your interest and takes half your paycheck"
Safeway,1eu89megho15p800,1.0,I have worked at safeway for 8 months as a courtesy clerk and its just constantly being talked to about little things that management screwed up and trickles down to you they treat you like a low life and you have to do everything in there for them everyday i have been nagged at for carts cause we only have like 3 in the store at full occupancy and they send most of the courtesy outside when there is no carts evento grab and have been threaten to be written up countless times for my hoodie even though im outside 45% of my shift and they only have medium company jackets if you really wanna get yelled at and have minimum hours safeways the place for you
Safeway,1eu6iahb7o15p800,3.0,"I hate the managers here, I tell them whenever I feel sick or need to have my schedule changed and it’s not only like they don’t listen but they go purposely out of their way to make me do more, or to directly put my shift on the hours/days I request not to have them on"
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1etbaoj57p113800,5.0,"Great pay, amazing workers. Management is awesome. Feels like home there. Schedule is good. Managers actually care. Your opinion matters. No one left behind"
Safeway,1et9eq5hrpi26800,3.0,"Safeway was a great place to work at, the management is terrible, but somewhat friendly. I applied as a helper clerk and was told to do night shift during the beginning of Covid, everyday. Helped frozen more than anything, which would have been fine if it wasn`t everyday, was told I would get a pay deferential for my night time work, but they set it up to where I`d only receive it for an hour, they exploited my schedule so they could save an extra buck. The co workers are great, but everyone talks about leaving everyday, so that shows something."
Safeway,1et8me9lsu1lf800,3.0,Working for a corporation seems to provoke some people to throw others under the bus as an easy way to secure their positions. Regardless of the drama I enjoy providing a service for the public.
Safeway,1et4rkpiku1n1800,1.0,If you like working hard to meet unattainable goals and being reprimanded constantly this is the company for you. District managers and merchandisers are downright mean to employees and customers. I’ve heard one merchandiser ask someone “if they were really that stupid.”
Safeway,1esrf306onpic800,2.0,"Safeway could be a great place to work. Unfortunately the bakery department of the store that I work in is lacking proper leadership. Employees do not feel heard, supported or cared for. This has lead to department infighting, no team atmosphere, and poor overall performance."
Safeway,1esqb5qdhu3cn800,2.0,The training is bad.  The pay and hours are low.  There is obvious favoritism. Questions go unanswered.  Attitudes are bad and management is unfriendly/inapproachable.
Safeway,1esp0oahpu31u800,3.0,it sometimes feels that were working at a sweat shop. never enough people to do the hetic jobs. seams that our department is always behind.it would be a lot better if we had more people.
Safeway,1esnknuqou31u800,3.0,Make sure you read everything before you sign anything. Make sure you meet your Union representative And talk to them before agreeing to do anything. Especially when speaking to higher ups. When talking to managers make sure you have proof of each conversation its best to text.  Don't expect to eat Or use the restroom comfortably you only receive two 15 minute breaks A-day.
Safeway,1eslhhjgdnpic800,2.0,They talk about customer service but the company is only about the bottom line. It use to be about service but not any longer. Pay and benefits are at 30% of what they use to be.
Safeway,1eskq96ssnpcv800,5.0,Good first job very easy going fun productive nice friendly environment good staff light work easy 8 hours never disappoints as a job helpful resourceful
Safeway,1eskijs74u3cn800,3.0,"The job itself was nothing special. Management was where my issues lie mostly, but this is typical for most big box stores.  Some managers are good and some are not so good. Some give a lot of constructive criticism and praise, while others use guilt-tripping and manipulative tactics to change your level of performance. Time off is given but getting PTO is  more difficult. I did not stay long enough to use benefits, but after some time they were offered."
Safeway,1esjci5cht4lr800,2.0,Chill people to work with but the hours can be garbage and the pay as well. Managers can range from cool to down right incompetent or just total jerks.
Safeway,1esh62j0vo26o800,3.0,"Friendly workspace: workers are easy to talk to, there was paid training, and workers would check up on each other for emotional support when off the clock."
Safeway,1esh4k5n7u2j7800,4.0,"I got lots of experience everywhere in the store. Hard work is noticed, and hard work usually translates to a better job in the store. Some workers don't do a good job, so hard workers tend to pick up the slack."
Safeway,1esenp9bo304h000,5.0,"You have to climb the ladder and earn your seniority, but my hard work is often recognized and rewarded. I really enjoy all of my co workers and work environment And once you’re well versed and skilled in multiple departments and have a variety of skills and are good at multi-tasking, the possibilities are endless."
Safeway,1esbl396snplu800,1.0,Don’t work for Safeway they’ll do hours whenever they feel like it. They will promote you but pay stays the same and you end up waiting for the pay to go up based on years worked there
Safeway,1es5u11h3npoh800,1.0,"Overworked, under paid, and disrespected by employees and customers. Retail is only good for teenagers' first time job. Would not recommend for anyone else"
Safeway,1es5sv23dnpoh800,2.0,Unions have sold out and takes 18 months to get the better benefits
Safeway,1es50oubgnplu800,4.0,Good for a part time job. So the work enviroment is cool and the hours can be good but the work is quite busy and can be stressful. It’s okay. Don’t know if I’d go back
Safeway,1es3q2vhanpoh800,4.0,"The pay is nice and your backed by a union. It’s difficult to become full time unless you become a department manager. Being a department manager although nice has a lot of problems that comes with it. The schedule that you set for your schedule is never really set because hours are constantly changed by upper management to reduce cost. Any problems that come with the reduced hours falls on you so it’s not uncommon to have the store manager or an operations manager calling or texting you about problems that don’t have enough manpower to fix. If your looking for a job to just work your scheduled shift , get a check and leave. Then this is your job."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1es0su2oknplu800,3.0,I was hired to work in the spring of 2020 for extra pandemic relief. I was there for 4 months. I had no plans to stay. The people are great we all work hard as a team. Everyone is hungry for hours. Very flexible hours expect to work every holiday.
Safeway,1erv1co1lnplu800,3.0,"I worked for the company for 4 years, worked my way up and through too management. Each districts salary managers and cooperates are very tight nit group who do not welcome the growth of others. So if you're looking to be management or promote within I would choose elsewhere."
Safeway,1ert57ufs3obo000,3.0,"Great entry level job, no education requirement, can be very physically demanding. There is a union but typically focused on protecting employees with longer tenure."
Safeway,1erq385r7o17p800,3.0,Everyone there is really nice to work with management acts great while they're in your face but don't expect anybody to ever have your back. Most everyone that works there complains about upper management or even direct Management in every department just seems like it's falling apart they need to revamp and get new management in there that actually cares.
Safeway,1erpcmmn53084000,5.0,"Great place to work, except for the pay.  No set schedule and because they don’t post the following weeks schedule until Sunday, it makes it hard to be able to make personal appointments.  Management is good.  Lots of room for advancement."
Safeway,1ero7tj83o17p800,3.0,"It was fun working at Safeway for the customer interaction, cool coworkers and the fast paced environment during busy hours. The regular customers were the only ones who seemed to appreciate you. The managers, well you have to cut some of them slack. It’s a lot of work to do for them, 60-70 hours a week. There were some cool managers and then the not so cool managers."
Safeway,1ermtgd01o17p800,2.0,"The job is what it is, hours can sway randomly, they’ll assign you to a new job, and not enough workers on occasions. People are great, pay sucks. The managers are mostly relaxed, but there is one who forgets that we are human and pushes us like we’re robots. Also the union will ask for a large sum of money to pay per month, and will pay that continually for a while. There is typically a large sum of people that will quit randomly. The job will also do its best to not pay their workers more if given the opportunity, and requesting time off will be almost near impossible. The guidelines to follow Covid is also a hazard, as a coworker in the meat department did not wash their hands once after going to the bathroom, and no guarantee they washed it after. There is also no part in keeping it clean aside from the floors. There is also a horrible balance between communication among all departments, where one department fails to work with others and becomes an overall issue with no resolution."
Safeway,1erilhreto2gt800,5.0,Let’s just say that if you have the skills and the drive this is the right place for you!
Safeway,1eri5vrduo2gt800,3.0,"Love this place! ITs so cool , I work day to day get paid alot in this company am looking forward to moving on within this company of course! Thank you"
Safeway,1erhe6reau49m800,1.0,"Store manager's and the dms are terrible. Don't work here. They are never happy and they're extremely disrespectful. Store managers, even throw their department heads under the bus. They need more training for upper management to filter out expectations. Some store managers can't do anything but they will get on you and make you feel like your less than. And sometimes I think they want you to work off the clock for lack of hiring on there part when we have company."
Safeway,1erfph8o1sa97800,3.0,10 hour work days with an hour and 15 minute drive. Upper management is never happy no matter what you do. Your schedule can change within minutes in the middle of the day.  Get calls or texts at home that you need to come to work. Not an option.
Safeway,1erfgeaqpo2gt800,3.0,Nice employees and coworkers. Feels like a family. Managers can be nice but some don't appreciate their employees. Over worked and not payed fairly for the amount of work you do. Stressful but you can move between departments.
Safeway,1erdcljg13084000,1.0,The bad part about Safeway is that management doesn’t even care about their employees for the most part all they’re good at doing is taking advantage of them
Safeway,1erb8v6jc3084000,2.0,If you get promoted there more weight on your shoulders and if you can’t handle this job will take over your life. I was part of management and if you get that far you best love what you doing or you’ll hate your job cause how much stress it puts on you everyday.
Safeway,1era4t2dgu35m800,4.0,Safeway is a good company to work for.  My experience at my home store was good.  Fellow employees and managers were good to work with.  Unfortunately I was assigned to other stores to help at. I did not enjoy any of those work sites.
Safeway,1era43sh1sa97800,2.0,Only worked there part time for school but the work was grueling. You are not compensated fairly for how hard you work. Wouldnt go back even if they begged.
Safeway,1er8mg6v6o2gt800,5.0,"It can be difficult at times but the management in the front end is very supportive. I felt like if I needed help during rush hour, I was able to get support."
Safeway,1er3eco7ho2gt800,2.0,"not sure how anyone can actually work here as a career. not really realistic unless you have a side hustle to pay the other bills, i heard a man working there for over 5 years still didn't get a raise unless the wage changed..."
Safeway,1er2vdl62u49m800,5.0,"Its great. Everybody gets along for the most part, there is never a dull moment! We stay steady and always have something to do, and management is amazing in my store!"
Safeway,1er2lrv9ho2gs800,3.0,"Meat department is lacking in some areas. High egos, trashy hours, bad management. Meat manager will just verbally abuse you instead of trying to help you be a better employee"
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1er2ian7du49m800,1.0,Managers don't care about the employees. The managers care about their salary and what they can do for themselves. A very GREEDY business that I will never work for again.
Safeway,1er0r8f97o2gs800,1.0,Management is the worst at this company. They don't care about employees whatsoever and always always side with customers over us even if the customer is flat out harassing us. Terrible place.
Safeway,1equiufipo2gt800,2.0,I feel like a drone... 8 hours of hardcore human interaction for just minimum wage. These are supposed to be essential workers having to deal with every single person in society and we only get paid minimum wage and only allowed a 10 minute break
Safeway,1eqtiaha4o2gs800,1.0,"When I first got hired I was glad I had the job but until Covid happened Safeway showed their true colors they don’t care about you, they only care if you show up to work or not, The Courtesy Clerk position is mentally tiring and I don’t recommend that position to anyone. This company makes you get carts in 100+ degree weather for 30 minutes."
Safeway,1eqm8gkbao2gt800,2.0,Company focuses on profit and not customer service. Will purposefully not use allocated payroll budget to try and gain bonuses. Promotion and raises are based on how friendly you are with management team not performance.
Safeway,1eqks8ddju49m800,3.0,It is ok place  to work if you have good management working in bakery  can be fun and demanding must be able to work  at a fast pace.you are always busy
Safeway,1eqgetdrjo2gt800,3.0,"I worked between 6 departments daily, from personal experience at my location I hated it. Managers didn’t care for anyone, nobody did work properly, and I was forced to do so much out of job description. Paid minimum wage for near manager work, if I was lucky I’d get a 5$ coupon tho :,)))) (even tho it only worked for a day on few stuff more than 10$)"
Safeway,1eqaq5tidsa99800,2.0,We constantly were running low on basic supplies like coffee beans. About 2 or three months in the old Starbucks manager quit and suddenly I had to relearn everything they taught me during training because apparently the old manager wasn't doing it right. Everything became really strict and high stakes.
Safeway,1eq8d7a7jsa97800,5.0,Great place to work
Safeway,1eq4puiu7o2gt800,5.0,Learn to hold your own kiddos it's a grocery store.
Safeway,1epv7shppo2gt800,3.0,Worked as a cashier.  Enjoyed working with the public.  They worked with me on the shifts I was available. My husband had surgery and was in a rehab center for three months.  They were very good about working with me so I could spend time with him.
Safeway,1epudhv9no2gt800,1.0,"very unprofessional store and management , management does not do anything about harassment , they do not care about your feelings whether you are uncomfortable or not"
Safeway,1eprv2513o2gt800,1.0,They don’t train you. They just put you out there with the customers so if that sounds fun then Safeway is for you. They overwork you and don’t offer much help.
Safeway,1eprcjo9ro2gs800,2.0,It is a growing industry with many changing factors and constantly new expectations to meet. The staff I worked with were nice and friendly. The benefits were good.
Safeway,1eppsaugju49m800,3.0,"Good coworkers for the most part. Don't expect management to do much as far as discipline, unless it is in regards to attendance. If you complain to certain managers they tell the person and it creates hostility. One of the best things is the union. Crazy summers and holidays but plenty of overtime if you're willing to work hard and effectively."
Safeway,1eppn0tp2o2gs800,1.0,"Horrid experience from day one. Was left alone for computer training on first day for 8 hrs. I was officially trained by an employee that had worked at company less than six months. Was expected to close by myself on my second week of working there. Did not feel properly trained. Rarely ever had time to take my break and stayed late most nights. Understaffed, should have had two bakery clerks on closing shift. I had to call in to be officially terminated, company did not communicate with me. Lacked professionalism from upper management department. Felt stooped from the first day."
Safeway,1epp0b7ceo2gs800,3.0,"Not good at training, learned more from my younger affiliate than my Dept Manager. They let you learn from your mistakes. Prioritize sales over proper procedure. Cut corners to keep within hours. You can't do it all but they still expect you to."
Safeway,1epn9msoao2gs800,1.0,"Horrible place to work, no security, no organization, employees were the best part about the job, to be honest, but management was horrible and discrimination was and is real trust me. not about being a team."
Safeway,1epmscbsgo2gt800,2.0,Overall it’s a job you will always have with benefits and security. They need to be more adamant about covid requirements and protocols for customers.
Safeway,1epmjpeueo2gs800,5.0,"enjoy working there great people great atmosphere just not enough hours . Its mostly part time employees & you get more hours the longer you have been there which is fair , however I can not afford my bills on this job alone"
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1epmfvio2o2gt800,4.0,"It isnt a bad work place, but the management when i was there had trouble communicating and while the people were great as people, they weren't always the best at working"
Safeway,1epi1dsudu43g800,5.0,I love my job in my two in a half years of working with safeway and i have gotten two promations and am niw a department manager with my sights for higher and there willing to help me make it there there are even willing to help pat for collage and gd classes if you are willing to put in the efforts!
Safeway,1ephv7q6unpl6800,4.0,You always have something to do so it’s a very productive job . You will never get bored of working because you are always moving. Some things can be hard to carry but you can always ask for help.
Safeway,1ephqdt4unpl6800,5.0,Coworkers are very friendly. I worked here part time while going to school. Benefits were very good for a part time job. Management was always friendly.
Safeway,1epdgtj71npl6800,1.0,Worst company I have ever worked for. Managers are the only people who get any sense of incentive to work hard and many of them will treat their employees terribly if they don't bend over backwards for them.
Safeway,1ep9m70ejt4it800,1.0,Working at Safeway was one of the worst jobs I had due to management. The Deli was always understaffed and underpaid. There were many days I worked off the clock because you would get yelled at for working overtime but we were so understaffed and needed desperate help. They only thank you for being helpful but give nothing to show for it.
Safeway,1ep6q29rs2v69000,2.0,"Double standards everywhere, managers are inexperienced and don’t care for their employees unless they are willing to show up to work and face managerial problems every single day"
Safeway,1ep4q9grt2v69000,3.0,"I enjoyed the work itself, but the department manager was uptight, impatient, & quick to scold over incorrectly completed tasks, though said manager wasn't proactive to explain how tasks should & should not be done in order to avoid the mistakes in the first place. Co-workers were chill, friendly, & very helpful, but I was often told how to do things completely differently from what the manager expected, leading to more scolding. Again, I really liked the work, but with the manager's unhelpfullness & negativity, & lack of sufficient communication among department staff, it was getting too stressful. I decided to quit."
Safeway,1ep2fhmus3oec000,1.0,I worked with Albertsons for 13 years and loved it. The second the merged with Safeway i hated it. I was just a number and I lost my management job due to the merger and stores closing down
Safeway,1ep2ddav5u3ib800,3.0,"I loved working with most of the employees. They are hard working. It is not the employees, it's the management. Management do not know how hard we work everyday. If it wasn't for us there would be no store."
Safeway,1ep1bj2r4saaa800,4.0,"Very good company to work for, mainly worked over night, no customers for the 6 hours, with gave us plenty of time to stock and recover the store. Help with any opening tasks check and walk management before going home. I do miss working there. Room for growth and move it up if you're willing to put in the work."
Safeway,1ep01tm8f3oec000,5.0,"I really enjoyed this job. Working at customer service was a fun routine I could fall into, and I didn't mind helping people. Managers were very helpful and kind, and I generally didn't have any issues."
Safeway,1eoo7lrirnpgr800,1.0,Worked at Safeway to help my family pay the bills at the start of the pandemic. I quickly left after being schedule 40+ hour work weeks when I made it known that I was a graduating senior in college.
Safeway,1eoo4fhn0npgr800,5.0,Promotions and sales happen all the time allowing guests to shop with confidence and affordability. Friendly staff and management always trying to improve the store.
Safeway,1eonp7629npgr800,3.0,"It's an alright job, but I feel like my hard work goes unnoticed most of the time. No matter how hard you work, the management team is too busy to notice. Don't expect any positive encouragement after working hard. It's good experience for a 17 year old high school student."
Safeway,1eol9binmnpgr800,4.0,"Job was pretty easy. You go in, cut fruits and veggies, put em in correct containers, label them and put them on the shelves. The hours were steady. The days would jumble from time to time. Met great people there and they made everything easier."
Safeway,1eoir1p81npgr800,4.0,Job is not bad if you stay out of the drama. Union is awesome and works hard for us. Benefits are beyond awesome and affordable. PTO adds up quickly.
Safeway,1eogvpp3mnpgn800,5.0,it was an awesome place to work friendly co workers good pay friendly wprk environment very helpful during training a lot of opportunities to move up if n you are motivated
Safeway,1eoggarntnpgr800,3.0,"My coworkers managers and customers were great and I would do anything for my store. Conversely, corporate only seems to be interested in maximizing profit at all cost."
Safeway,1eofg8d89npjc800,2.0,"I have this job 110% but no matter how long I work or how hard I tried, they would always find something to say about my work not being good enough. They want you to get everything done, but there's so much they give you to do it's near impossible to finish in your shift. Then if you DO get it all done but it takes longer than your shift, they also get on you. You can't win either way!"
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1eob5b1k1304r000,1.0,I have a hard time every day working for Safeway. Ever heard of retaliation? That happens  at this company. It’s hard working for a place where nothing has anything positive to say and it starts with management.
Safeway,1eoabofnhu2no800,1.0,"Where do I even begin, I would recommend teens to work here if they are looking to get started in the workforce. There is little to no advancement when working with this company"
Safeway,1eo627h4fu2ju800,1.0,"No training, district manager and assistant manager blamed the assistant manager for everything that went wrong. Cashiers are pushed to much to sign up people for club cards, collect donations from customers. No work life balance for people working in store, required to work all holidays including Christmas. Customers complaints are always right even when several witlessness all say they are wrong  leading to employees receiving discipline, while the customer receives an apology and a free $25 gift card. The stress, tension, and worry caused by this company isn't worth the compensation. My advise, DO NOT WORK HERE. It is horrible!! As an assistant manager was paid 40 hours and required to work 50. Common to work 70 hours a week . They don't care about the employees."
Safeway,1eo1a3mr7u2d6800,3.0,"Safeway was my first job. It was good for building customer service skills, and it was nice to be greeted by regular customers. Most of my coworkers were really nice. Management was a little questionable with scheduling."
Safeway,1eo0oonalo15h800,4.0,Loved working here even though it wasn’t for that long I felt that there was a real community in the store. I would recommend working there to a friend anytime.
Safeway,1eo03cua1t52k800,3.0,Working here was alright. The managers at my location would favorite a lot of the other employees. They also never disciplined anyone for not doing their job. Overall the experience was okay.
Safeway,1ent7710nt44v800,1.0,"I would not recommend working for this company. The wages are not competitive, no room for advancement and they need better management. They do not seem to give full time hours."
Safeway,1ennvngr4o15h800,1.0,"i worked in the starbucks kiosk but i got to know most of the different people in the departments. management was childish, and immature. they all picked favorites. management of the kiosk ? a joke. was not qualified for the job. i was hired way after them and i would have been more qualified for he position. i was doing half of their work anyways! manager was fake to my face constantly. complained about my closes, but they would always leave stuff undone, not stocked,or not cleaned. left her duties for closing employees to do. wouldnt answer the phone when we needed help. wouldnt EVER come in to help staff. always left during the busiest parts of the day. ignored big issues. ignored all complaints from staff. managers of the safeway always took her side. never listened to any complaints from employees. ALSO, when covid first hit, their percautions were not up to par. I was cussed at one day for telling my boss i wasnt feeling good and didnt feel comfortable working that day. :) how lovely.  i was never recognized for the hard work i did. i was also ALWAYS guilted into coming in on my days off, or for not coming in when i have chronic illnesses."
Safeway,1enlqgpdanpn0800,5.0,"I started as a courtesy clerk when I was 17 and moved around to different departments, like front desk, floral and cashier. It was cool, the hours around the holidays were always funky though. Good experience overall."
Safeway,1enl14hevnpn0800,5.0,Fantastic place to work! Especially if you're a high schooler and need to look for a place to work that doesn't require previous work experience. Minimum wage but that's expected.
Safeway,1enkk83d8u2d6800,5.0,SAFEWAY treats their employees with respect and they acknowledge the hard work you put in.  The union gives you great health benefits.  Overall I had a great experience working for the company.
Safeway,1eni2falqo15h800,3.0,"Great starting place for those trying to build a basic resume. Nothing special. I worked here in high school and it helped build my confidence so I could move on to a different job after graduating. Flexible hours, but you are either super bored or way too overworked."
Safeway,1engk8jbfnpn0800,4.0,Overall
Safeway,1enfes643u2d6800,3.0,"Job sucked got treated as if I didn't know a thing about deli products and my team wasn't very helpful, making it hard to learn how to complete job related tasks"
Safeway,1enejqklr2v8b000,1.0,"It is retail, no weekends off. Learn on your  own . If they can get you to do a job out of your job description, they will not pay you for it. Keep your eyes open, keep in mind at all times your specific job description you were hired for."
Safeway,1eneejn8p2v8b000,3.0,"Fine place for temporary work but progression is horrible, not a good place to make a career. Your experience at the workplace completely depends on your managers."
Safeway,1encrh04i2v8b000,3.0,"I worked at the Seattle Madison Street location for exactly two days. The communication of the staff was poor. I never even received orientation or workplace training. The store manager is not a nice person - disrespectful, aggressive, and impatient. Other locations might be favourable, but this one was not, and after two days of this, I could see it was not going to work out. I do not recommend working here."
Safeway,1enbjcp79u1gm800,2.0,low starting pay and Poor management; management lacks insight and genuine concern for its employees; hours vary drastically from daily to weekly; poor scheduling
Safeway,1en9lnaoq3o5h000,3.0,"I worked here a courtesy clerk. Job was extremely average, and whatever you are expecting is likely what you are going to get. Most of the coworkers and customers are friendly."
Safeway,1en4v3fslu3d8800,5.0,Good work good pay good lifestyle good commute good place good people good colors good pets good flooring good treats good friends good times good muffins
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1en4bjvtuo1no800,1.0,"I started out as a Pharmacy Technician. The process was very slow, almost three weeks! Horrible place! No work Structure at all.They make you work 10 hour shifts, with only 30 Minute break. I kid you not!!!"
Safeway,1en38pkdku3sj800,3.0,Being a courtesy clerk isn't necessarily hard but I couldnr find the right word for it the job is like 5 or 6 different jobs pushed into 1 and the pay isnt all that great for it at my store im expected to do almost everything very fast and sometimes on my own which can get overwhelming quick when your name is being called over and over to different spots of the store
Safeway,1en1cr0ggo22b800,3.0,"Good place to work if you don't have a family and enjoy working at a fast pace with long hours, Great benefits.  If you are looking for a place of employment where you will feel appreciated, you will not find it there."
Safeway,1emva4rvro1no800,1.0,Good for if your in school. Good if your not because you get raises.  They dont hire much cashiers anymore because of those self check out things.
Safeway,1emqdp8rbnptv800,2.0,"I’ve worked for Safeway for 5 years and know every thing about the way they work. Pretty much your expected to learn extremely fast and work fast and if you don’t , youl get demoted or treated badly , it’s just the way it is. The management there gets treated badly and they take that out on you . It’s not really a good place to work. People who advance are just chosen and get lucky. This can be scene blatantly with people who work extremely hard don’t get promoted compared to others who do half as much and move up some how. It’s a bad retail environment so don’t expect much. The biggest plus is that you learn a lot from talented people some times ."
Safeway,1emq2si5rnptv800,3.0,"When I applied at Safeway, the application listed the job as full-time. But, when they hired me, they said it was actually an official part-time job. Then they gave me part-time hours. It eventually got bad enough that they only gave me a half shift a week - that's four hours of work every week. They refused to release the schedule until the Friday before, and the schedule was subject to change. One day, my scheduling was changed without my knowledge, and they threatened to fire me for not showing up according to my new schedule. Overall, don't apply unless you don't care about hours."
Safeway,1empvti08o15v800,2.0,"I enjoyed working at the Danville location, I had decided to transfer closer to where I live and unfortunately I regret it. Moving to a closer location didn’t work out for me because it changed my hours to hours that I was unable to work and could not switch my shift in that department and if I wanted to switch shifts I would have to be hired in a different department. The management there to me was treating employees unkind and unfair."
Safeway,1empc08fhnptv800,1.0,"Managers are absolute a holes and could care less about their employees.  All they care about is if they're gonna get yelled at by upper management or not and it's a terrible place to work.  People come and go so frequently because it doesn't take long to realize how much it sucks there.  They absolutely hoe their employees too.  If you finish your work early they ask you to go home early to save money.  They offer no overtime really and even if you want to work overtime, they don't even pay time and a half or anything even close to it being worth it to work extra.  They cut people's hours all the time without warning or reason so if you do go in just go for 8 hours and make sure you get paid.  Speaking of pay their pay is embarrassingly low.  I already mentioned that they don't pay anything extra for overtime, which is probably to discourage overtime since they woulrn't want to pay people extra anyway.  They laugh if you ask to change positions and they could care less for students if they have to work on the days they have classes too.  And don't bother asking to change your hours or call in because they don't see school as a good enough excuse."
Safeway,1emp3ihgro15v800,1.0,"This particular Safeway was NOT a place I could work in, for even a year. To start they gave me 1 shirt and 1 apron.....1 shirt......not 2 or 3.  Just 1. I dont wear that many clothes to wash to make Load to add my work shirt to every couple days!! They hire too many people and barely give you any hours and literally FORCE you to join a union or you can't work there. THAT IS ILLEGAL!!  They did NOT do as they said with their radio advertisement. They did not pay you for training as mentioned. They have great benefits if you're a full time employee yet NO ONE but the managers have full-time which they will give no one enough hours to get any benifits. Although the manager wants to stop thieves (a very hard working man) his hands are tied because the people over him are willing to fire him as a result of confronting them. As a result thieves go unpunished ands its pretty much a free for all for them when they don't get caught. We have a bathroom where druggies and homeless people make there own and can take over an hour to leave or until the manager or security has to bang on the door. I left because I absolutely HATED working for a company who builds their brand off of lies and finds loopholes to not provide. We even had a survey that cheated us out of telling the surveyor what we really felt. So they know they are feeding staff horse manure. I did enjoy my job though. I absolutely LOVED the people I worked with and working with the customers...well most of the customers. Its just the bad really outweighed the good here. Some customers literally saw how difficult it is working"
Safeway,1emnfdfk6u1m2800,2.0,The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because work/life balance is pretty good and pay can be decent if you move up into management. The management is terrible they only care about putting money in their pockets and not about their employees at all. I have to stop myself from walking out almost daily. They like to constantly use fear tactics and threats as a way to motivate people.
Safeway,1emjc2eqinpup800,1.0,Don't work here! Your hours will be cut with no notice at all. Safeway doesn't pay a living wage bat all! I was the only employee in my department for 6 hours. No break in that time. I didn't even have coverage to leave to use the bathroom.
Safeway,1emi9b04fnpu1800,3.0,I was hired with Safeway and I was happy about it. I read some employee reviews before hand to understand what situation I was coming into. This store management is not really good at all. No communication between management and staff unless your buddy/buddy with them. Management let’s long time staff do as they please. Some employees are too talkative to other staff and customers which creates really long lines in the store. The fact that I was hired and left to figure out who’s management staff (which by the way didn’t introduce themselves to me until I had to introduce myself to them) shows me that this store is very micromanage. 2nd day of my training I was doing my training on the computer and the lady who hired me left to go home. She didn’t tell me that she was off or who to go to for help. One of the assistant manager has a superior attitude.
Safeway,1emg56hfnu1ac800,2.0,The pay is pretty decent but the management here is terrible. The grocery department orders are terrible. They want you to stack 6 thousand pounds of product on double pallets that have no structure to them at all.
Safeway,1emfvs5c0u1m2800,5.0,"Great value for time and energy spent in return for excellent compensation, including generous starting benefits and vacation + weekly pay, nice work environment, very much enjoy working for this company!"
Safeway,1emb5dqfjo16r800,3.0,Not paid enough to get own place.
Safeway,1emar63r6o16r800,3.0,I have learned a lot and am very grateful for the opportunities I have been given but working every holiday and weekend has taken a toll on me.   It is high stress
Safeway,1ema4k20to16r800,5.0,I had a great time working there. Management was excellent they gave me the opportunity to move up quickly and compensated me extremely well. I will miss working there especially my managers very good people. Thank you for the opportunity im sorry to be leaving.
Safeway,1em82hsjeu2u5800,3.0,Gets pretty tiresome. Over worked at some point and don't really get appreciated by the hard work you. Just get put down for the things you couldn't get accomplished through the work day. And training kinda sucks just a sink or swim type thing.
Safeway,1em7vhmdiu1nm800,5.0,"They used to invest a great deal in training Managers. I actually requested very detailed training during my salary negotiations. I began as a 2nd Assistant Manager, was promoted to 1st Assistant in 3 weeks, and I was eligible for Store Manager Training within a year. After certifying as a Store Manager, I became a trainer for my district. The training I received was amazing. I am in contact with other former managers, and we all agree that Safeway’s SMRA Certification made it easy to “ace” future processes."
Safeway,1em6lseqko16r800,3.0,"Some P.I.Cs are amazing, others feel like more of a boss around type rather then a leader that should help keep the store running. Managers get all the over time they want but no one else is allowed any unless under rare circumstances. So much could be improved to make things run more smoothly but nothing is ever that simple at Safeway. If you try calling out and you get a supervisor, be ready to feel like you're worthless and threatened to lose your hours because they think ""you cant handle it"" because you're human and dont feel well for a day. And if you're a helper clerk get ready to do way more work then mostly everyone  and get paid the same as someone who just sits in the gas station on their phone all day."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1em5u56i8o259800,4.0,Don't underestimate how tough night crew can be. I struggle to keep a decent sleep schedule even after a few months. The work is good and I can listen to audio books while I work and am left alone most of the night. I like what I do but am struggling to justify continuing to work here because I can make more elsewhere and get the benefit of working in the day.
Safeway,1em3bgn3ho16r800,1.0,This was once a great place to work but not anymore. The pay is disgraceful and they do not appreciate their employees. It is very sad and disheartening!
Safeway,1em32gjhqu1nm800,4.0,My first job as a kid. Good to understand basics as a cashier. Job was not overwhelming.  My managers were good resources.
Safeway,1em1egf84o259800,2.0,"They teach you how to handle a hectic work environment, but that's it. They give minimum training and rack on more and more. If you're a stronger worker, they will have you pick up the slack of everyone else and you're in trouble if there are days (i.e. busy with customers) where you can't do it all. They will have you manage but not give you a management position or the pay. They won't properly address issues with other coworkers. Having anything repaired is like pulling teeth (i.e. hole with mold in the wall) and safety issues are often looked over. It gets more and more draining the longer you're there."
Safeway,1elvtf9gsu2u5800,4.0,"Your experience will vary depending on which store you work in. From my experience, it is the assistant manager that will be tough to work with, not the store manager. Lower level supervisors are the best. They care about your happiness and are lovely people trying to make their living. Pay is very, very low in comparison to other grocery stores last I checked. I worked part-time so I don't know anything about how the benefits are. The atmosphere is nice, low-lit and quiet. Getting approved to take off for a shift can be difficult, but super easy if you have someone to cover or switch with you. Overall management was fair and did not breathe down your neck as long as you were doing your job. The work is very easy with no stress, unless a customer induces their stress on you for something. After you have worked there a few months you can ask to move to another department. How long it will take is unknown, but it's possible."
Safeway,1elrt31t2o259800,2.0,Safeway is a good job but it’s hard when you have worked for a company for many years that doesn’t really care about you even though you are one of the hardest working employees in the store. I have made some incredible people that I call my friends.
Safeway,1eloip2j7npcn800,1.0,Very difficult you either freeze during the winter with little hours or almost die of heat stroke during the summer and need a drs note just  for water in your 8 hour shift and bosses won't protect me its a bullied environment sadly people in this position stay for years feeling like they can never get anything any better if they didn't quite within in the 1st week or 2 most do but its like high school drama all the time the Union seems the strongest on the most help. Though I would give them a 5 stare but document everything.
Safeway,1ellv9aqfu1cn800,4.0,I worked part-time due to a furlough/termination at my primary job due to covid-19 (China/Wuhan virus) on 03/17/2020.
Safeway,1ellq7omunpcn800,3.0,Overall
Safeway,1elliimi9nq3q800,4.0,No complaints good learning experience. I recommend working there easy job . Good workplace got the hours I needed/wanted while having a chance to meet new people.
Safeway,1ell5uifdu2j4800,3.0,"Worked there for 5 years. I don’t know why. New employees were starting out at the same wage I was making.... after 5 years. Flexible scheduling, but high turnover. A good job for high schoolers looking for their first job."
Safeway,1elk6493bnq3q800,1.0,"Our company tries to have us be under 16 hours a day in our home shopper department. This isn’t even enough to get breaks covered. Our manager is amazing and encouraging, but upper management is constantly on our butts basically wanting us to run around like chickens with our heads cut off 24/7"
Safeway,1elhni26enpcn800,2.0,"Honestly all I can say is this job is not worth it. Getting carts in 100+ degree weather is terrible, the managers barely even care if you’re having a heat stroke they only care if the lot is clear. I would just recommend staying away from the courtesy clerk position. One plus is that they’re super flexible and understanding with scheduling."
Safeway,1elg9kbfou2j4800,5.0,I really enjoyed my time at Safeway. There was always a great sense of camaraderie among myself and fellow employees. The managers were usually very helpful and supportive. The hours were usually very flexible and the pay was outstanding considering my position within the company (I was a Courtesy Clerk). I always felt like I was appreciated for what I did. Helping customers was my favorite part of the job. They were always so nice and fun to talk to. The only reason I quit was due to concerns with COVID-19. I would definitely consider going back again.
Safeway,1elfi18l2u2j4800,2.0,"it was great in the beginning but after a while you realize how over worked you are for such little pay, have to wait after a year of employment to get benefits."
Safeway,1eldg3u96u2j4800,1.0,"This was a terrible Safeway to work at. The managers don’t care about you and honestly you were under paid for the work that you do. The workers at this location are not the friendliest either. I only encountered one nice and helpful coworker. I could not stand working for this Safeway! Don’t apply here if you value your time, sanity, or paychecks."
Safeway,1el9jrs2nnq3q800,2.0,"I had my first job here and it was a horrible experience. Management clearly chooses favorites based on personality and does not notice the laziness of these courtesy clerks. Although some coworkers were a pleasure to work with, others gossiped a lot."
Safeway,1el8p3b1onpcn800,4.0,"My time at Safeway was great. I loved my coworkers and the position I held. However, the management team needs more work. It felt at times that we, as workers, were nothing but business pawns. We would be called into work on multiple days off and shunned if we didn't come in. The management didn't see that we have lives outside of work."
Safeway,1el6t11isnq3q800,1.0,"So called ""managers"" are untrained with sloppy work ethic. Do not expect much, this place is good for emergencies, otherwise, keep looking elsewhere."
Safeway,1el5viia4u1cn800,5.0,I spent most of my working life there a very dependable pay check I do fill thankful for that I would recommend it to anyone for employment I would recommend having any health care needs and treatment at any of facilities to receive world class care.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1el25ivchnph9800,2.0,"It gets worse every year. I don't feel there is a solutions for at better experience at the location where I work. It""s an unhealthy and unsafe environment to work in. Moral it very low. It's all work and no reward, except your pay check at the end of the week. There are employees that actually work and earn their pay and there are employees that should have been terminated a long time ago."
Safeway,1el1gr21uu2f5800,3.0,It was horrible but everyone was so gossipy and im young but I dont like that stuff and when your managers are constantly talking about their adult lifes it's just no appropriate. And my manager never liked me I work all the time long hours and I did my job extremely well but nothing was ever good enough for her and it became a really hostile environment.
Safeway,1el1elo99o1eg800,3.0,experience is now looked at as high expectation balanced with being  a financial liability as labor tightens.  They often look over major issues to address the flavor of the day. Product knowledge is lacking and training budget makes it diificult.
Safeway,1el14lac6nph9800,4.0,"I worked as a courtesy clerk so I typically just assisted the cashiers with bagging groceries, helped customers carry groceries to their car, and performed daily go-back tasks. My coworkers at my location were all friendly and laid back. My manager was very motivating and encouraged everyone to work to their potential. The hardest part of the job was rude customers or sketchy people coming into the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was being paid weekly."
Safeway,1el0q2r76o1eg800,1.0,"The deli is fine when you are working in the back and don't have to deal with as many customers. The job is not easy, just tedious, however the company will never side with you on an issue, you do not have the right to refuse service and my experience with higher ups and management at the company are not good. I constantly felt belittled at this company and never felt like I had the support and training to become successful at this job. The training is a joke. They don't really train you, they just make you watch some videos and throw you into the job and then get angry when you don't do things the way they do. I received my first write up this way.  The company is also paying less than most company for starting positions at other companies. I had to apply for the same job at a different company to leverage a pay raise, and when they did give me a pay raise they cut my hours so that I was still making the same amount of money.  I would honestly the reader go apply at Walmart first where they have a chance to make more money than they do at safeway."
Safeway,1el0omd67nph9800,1.0,"Young women will be harrased, stolen from, gossips about, thrown under the bus for others mistakes, and ridiculed. All which happened to me and other young women at Safeway."
Safeway,1ekvm9qmlo1eg800,1.0,Managers don’t care about you the employees are treated like peasants customers are mean working though the pandemic was awful we weren’t compensated at all
Safeway,1ekrc3ln1o1eg800,2.0,I only worked there for one day because of what I saw. In the break room people do not wear there face masks when sitting next to each other. The workers in the deli department don't regularly wash there hands they only change their gloves. People are very complacent which could lead to a covid outbreak. But I will say that most of the customers did wear masks.
Safeway,1ekpsarjdo1eg800,4.0,"I enjoyed my time While working at SafewayThe coworkers I met were amazing the job experience I obtained was fantastic but the management was terrible I had to leave due to consistent bullying from management constant Criticism with no support or Positive feedback From management despite working so hard to stand out and be the best employee I could be. You're capped out In regards to pay, unless you go into management you will not make any more than 14.50 an hour! There is hardly any Room for advancement And the management plays favorites  With employees that don't even deserve it. If they don't like you they will give you one day a week and basically make you quit, because it's a Union job they can't fire you unless it's for a good reason And that is the only benefit of working for Safeway."
Safeway,1ekp6slr6sabu800,1.0,Don't waste your time working here. There are no opportunities for advancement. Any other grocery store will start you out paying more. Horrible management.
Safeway,1ekoag5bho1eg800,3.0,"work at safeway if you dont want stress, but you are down with a chill job where you basically don't have to think whatsoever. this gets boring if u want to be mentally stimulated."
Safeway,1ekko8v5mnpj5800,3.0,"Working in the deli is like working at Popeyes,A busy take out Chinese restaurant and subway sandwiches all in one job.Iv’e learned about preparing fried foods and proper temperatures,different kinds of meats and cheeses.It can be very fast paced and because of the location,some of the customers are horrible.After 40 years in customer service,I’ve never been treated so horrible by the customers.Very verbally abusive.It’s mentally and emotionally draining.I usually go to bed soon as I get home and sleep for 12-14 hrs and get up and do it all over again because I feel like my soul has been sucked out of my body..It’s often difficult to get daily tasks competed as well as take care of the customers as well.The positive points are my co-workers.A couple of them I’ve bonded with in the short time that I’ve been employed there."
Safeway,1ekkjp9u9npj5800,1.0,I can not stress this enough I would love to work with them longer but they think they can play with my money. I asked and asked for more hours or a raise and they don’t give it to me cause “there’s bigger problems” that apparently I don’t know about
Safeway,1ekiuoq39npj5800,2.0,"For a first job its fine as long you plan to not stay too long managers disappear, some coworkers think they are managers, hours change constantly, cut hours with little to no warning"
Safeway,1ekit0pt2sa2d800,3.0,I got good hours when I first started but as time went on I started getting less and less hours and because of seniority I don’t have much options. We are understaffed a lot and customers can be very rude.
Safeway,1ekik1vpfsa2d800,4.0,"Kind of felt a bit of a stigma from my manager, but work was generally easy to learn and many of my co-workers are all great people. Running the express lane on a Sunday afternoon on my first day was not fun."
Safeway,1ekg9taqsnpmq800,1.0,I worked there in multiple departments and worked very hard for the company and was not appreciated at all. I would get bullied by a couple of employees including management. They would play favoritisms and treat their friends better than the other employees. Felt like I was in high school every time I came to work. Horrible people to work with and always drama. My advice is Don’t work here.
Safeway,1ekg7t78mnpj5800,3.0,I'm going to preface this with saying this:
Safeway,1ekg3lbduu2iu800,4.0,"I really liked the people I worked with.  There are opportunities for advancement.  The schedule is somewhat flexible, management will work with you.."
Safeway,1ekdn9cd330a3000,1.0,"Don’t work in the dot com department. This department is in charge of shopping for groceries ordered online and then delivered to the customer. They treat their employees unethically and set them up to fail. This company not only cuts hours but doesn’t allow overtime. Most shifts are so understaffed that the days work doesn’t get done in time. When an order is late, we are not allowed to notify the customers. Which creates very cranky customers that end up calling us and cursing us out because of a situation that we had no control over. The corporate office demands highly unrealistic goals. When these goals are inevitably not met, they tell us that we are “just not trying hard enough.” Most of my shifts end up being 10 hrs but I barely get to manage a ten minute break in the entire shift. As I said earlier, don’t work for dot com. It’s a dumpster fire."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1ekdcisglu3t5800,5.0,"I have not worked there since 2012.  I can not comment on Safeway at this time.  When I worked there, I really enjoyed my position at Safeway.  If I ever relocated back to California, I would definetly reapply at Safeway."
Safeway,1ekb6h88ou3t5800,1.0,"I worked at Safeway twice and I hated it both times, managers are rude, they get mad when you need an override like your asking for the fun of it. Customers were annoying and weird, especially the men. Overall wouldn't recommend, the pay wasn't even pocket change. Highly suggest you don't work for the one in Towson. People are always stealing and they get mad when you don't catch them like your security or something, and you don't get paid enough for it anyway. The managers where LITERALLY the worst, words can't even explain the bs I had to go through on the daily until I said f that and I quit.Overall you need a strong mental capacity if you decide to work there"
Safeway,1ekavqk7gt3qb800,2.0,it's an okay place of employment. Lots of standing and alot of customer complaints about everything.  It can be very stressful and draing. You will work every holiday.
Safeway,1ekarv12nnpmt800,5.0,Heavy pace work. Good pay.  There's some cons but the pros outweigh the cons. I recommend working here. It's a workout and you will be in shape . Apply and apply
Safeway,1ek3v0cmbs7ds800,5.0,Gave me a chance to show what I can be and what I can do for my self and my job the management team shows me positive feedback and makes me feel that I can accomplish anything.
Safeway,1ek2mbcvmo2dd800,3.0,It was ok working for safeway I learned a lot and I made new friends and it made me happy. I did the same thing every day I also worked in the floral department
Safeway,1ek29kru8o2dd800,3.0,"I generally liked this job, enjoyed working with the customers and coworkers. Learned a lot about the food I prepared and working on large scale. And work was very consistent and easy to accomplish as it was organized and standardized. But saw a lot of saddening management practices, such as a pregnant employee who was cut hours until she couldn't get paid maternity leave. Heard repeated bullying or harassment be reported and no reprecussions or change. It was really disappointing to see in a regional store."
Safeway,1ek1t0oapu3cj800,1.0,"Back in 2016 I worked at a Safeway in Highlands Ranch, CO. It was my first job ever, and I had landed a position as a courtesy clerk in the store. I had the basic duties of bagging groceries, bringing carts in, bagging trash, facing an aisle, and pushing milk forward. Seems easy enough, but I only sat there for two weeks before quitting. I was not given any instructions, and instead was thrown into whatever odd job the manager needed me to do. I was not given kneepads, I was not allowed to take any breaks, I was not given any equipment to help with bringing in the carts. Those things are heavy, and when only half of the wheels turn, and you have no way to lighten that load, and when your boss expects you to move at least 20 of them at once, it gets exhausting both mentally and physically. The fact that my shifts were only four hours long, and I was crying at the end of them every single time, either from how bad my body hurt from the physical exertion, or from the mental stress of abusive management. If I had to choose between working at a Safeway, and chugging spoiled milk, i'd choose the milk."
Safeway,1ek1m1jrku3cj800,2.0,It use to be a great place to work but then Albertsons took over and its been all down hill since then. You also got to be in good with management if you want to succeed in this company..
Safeway,1ek0vnhhro2cn800,3.0,PROS:
Safeway,1ek0ho4f1s7ds800,5.0,Safeway is a good company to work for! The only hang-up that I have or dislike that I have is not with the company. It's the fact that the co-vid 19 pandemic has pretty much put a halt on me attaining my meat cutter certification. Other than that no quarrels.
Safeway,1ek0h3u7ho2dd800,5.0,Work-life balance
Safeway,1ejvg7i8ru1ej800,3.0,"Not the greatest, but it was a paycheck. Management didn't know how to properly manage staff, whether due to poor experience or terrible expectations for their role."
Safeway,1ejubqas7o2cn800,1.0,"This is a great place for students to work, even if you’re in a management position, but there are way too many unrealistic expectations that are crammed down management’s throat, which then leads to a stressful and chaotic work environment. I would not recommend Safeway as a permanent place of work because it will have a negative impact on your mental health. I worked for this company for 7 years as supervisor and though there is room for advancement, get ready to play a lot of passive aggressive political games to move up. One of the worst parts of working for Safeway is that the stock was public so your labor depends on how the market and economy is doing. Sometimes you’d barely have enough help during the day, and most of the time you’d have no support, even on the busiest days of the month. This is not a company that cares for its employees or customers and they make sure you know it."
Safeway,1ejo0gc5dnpdo800,3.0,Overall
Safeway,1ejmki5a4u1l6800,4.0,"My only real complaint is how manegment rarely backs their employees while dealing with particularly rude or awful customers. They tend to placate and give them whatever they want. But, there's always a chance to cross train in multiple departments giving you more opportunity for hours, pay raises and growth."
Safeway,1ejlgsbuanpt5800,1.0,At the hiring events they tell you what you want to hear and when it comes to working it’s the complete opposite. They are hiring a lot because it is hard to keep people with what they are promised. On my first day of training I was sent home 12 minutes into my shift. Before getting hired I said I would only work there if I was guaranteed certain days off for my law enforcement test to which they agreed. They made me quit my good job that I had and on the first day when I asked the superintendent he said he could t give me days off and that he didn’t want me to waste his time and sent me home I called HR and complained but since it was my word against his they gave the benefit of the doubt to him. When I came back they tried to make me quit by telling me that I no longer had a schedule and had to call an hour before work to see if I was needed. They eventually terminated me because my production was unacceptable. How could it be unacceptable if I barely worked? As soon as my percentage went up they stopped calling me in. There’s a reason why people don’t last there and they are constantly hiring. It’s not worth the pay
Safeway,1ejjpf5oks78h800,5.0,"I have been working for Safeway since 2015. I love helping every customer and had no issues with staff members at work, and met new people along the way. The company help me develop new skills. When difficult situations arrive, I was able to solve them with a positive mindset."
Safeway,1ejjj1pfcnpt5800,2.0,I love working there but the manager and district manager put too much pressure on employees. They don’t work with your schedule or give you days off you request. It’s very toxic environment.
Safeway,1ejjdq472npdo800,2.0,"In a year and a half High turnover not much training if you did,not have skills all ready. training supervision weak. Saw health code violations some employees lacked english skills like on the phone which resulted in bad customer service.Promises made for advancement scuddled when Department Managers moved on to other jobs. Weak interpersonal communications .Fly by the seat of your pants no reviews at all that mattered rigged level one pay scale who in 2020 gives  A dime or nickel raises its not 1920. Bad Covid prevention Customers with no Masks and Manners harassing employees over items not available no Security. In your book do you want a bombastic Night Crew Stocking Manager too make Decisions not in there Wheel house just off the Handle.."

Safeway,1ejj5g716npt5800,5.0,"I work hard in the bakery department, and making doughs for French breads, sourdough breads, baguettes. I also breakout frozen productions to set-up to bake the next morning. I also organize bakery products in a freezer, and I clean the freezer."
Safeway,1ejj3v2trnpdo800,1.0,"Without going into specific times, repeatedly shifts would be mischeduled or left unattended, manager never looked out for employees or customers.

Safeway,1ejg4u7ilo1i3800,3.0,A good place to work but hard to make a career. A lot of staff are underpaid for there position but is a good job to start off at or have as a part time position.
Safeway,1ejg1k9ovo17f800,3.0,"Too much rat race and none organization. Very bad scheduling too many cashiers when their not needed, Not enough when their needed. There needs to be a front store manager not just an general and a store manager."
Safeway,1ejf2g8n5u1qd800,1.0,Dont waste your time. The hiring manager made me believe I would be doing a customer service field register etc. I git no support on my first day of training.  Stuck me in a computer room fir 9 hoursand never checked in me. Second day my last day. I thought I would be doing register and expected me to be a janitor....the store manager is rude unhelpful and I felt harrassment from all levels. I walked out....dont waste your time at Safeway
Safeway,1eje6m9lgu3pg800,1.0,Safeway pharmacy is not the place to work. They decreased our hours but still have the same work load. So we are staying 2 hours after close of business and working like dogs. This is working at a feverish pace. And we are up 200% per our manager. I don’t know how the managers sleep at night. Pharmacists are making mistakes.  They don’t care about providing a safe work place. It’s fraud waste and abuse. If you are in pharmacy school switch to another major. There are no jobs and the pay will be very minimum. My tech left to go work for more money at Chipotle. $10.40 an hour for tech pay. Wow.
Safeway,1ejbuu0peu3pg800,5.0,So fun to work at. I loved my cowokers. nice place. Good size store not to big not to small just right. They have a small deli and a big bakery. I miss working there.
Safeway,1ejb4s9982v7k000,1.0,the job is not diffiult but management can be taxing.  There is no appreciation of the employees and the disrespectul manner in which employees are treated is like we do not matter.
Safeway,1ej9l9vbgolck800,1.0,A typical day at work includes finishing everything I have to do within the first hour of being there so for the next 8 hours of work I would walk around the store aimlessly. Everything you will do is so repetitive it will make time go insanely slow.

Safeway,1ej79q065olck800,3.0,"Good place for work if you don’t need that many hours, but sometimes work load can be a lot and turnover rate is high. Also not much room to advance.."
Safeway,1ej6d4n4ku1dj800,4.0,Liked job and like my management and coworkers this job was okay however the pace sucked and not having insurance for a whole year sucked if you're just looking for a job I would recommend this company you get paid weekly at least
Safeway,1ej49je9lolck800,3.0,Worked as produce clerk. Job was straightforward but there is a massive amount to learn. You make products (fruits and vegetables) look nice and throw away the bad ones. Restock and rotate products from the backroom. Manager was flexible and the crew are all great. Night shifts can be extremely slow and boring about half the time. Underpaid for how much work there is.
Safeway,1ej24q5bgree1800,4.0,I worked graveyard shifts for about a year and it was pretty straightforward and chill. Its hard working nights sometimes but the job was pretty relaxed once you were done with the heavy lifting.
Safeway,1ej1gla3cree1800,1.0,"When I worked there I couldn't get a solid shift at a certain time every week because they fill spots where nobody else is working to meet the number of workers. So basically you have to work everything around this and it can be a pain. At the job is where most of the pain comes from though. You are tasked with cleaning the store, running items back to aisles, getting carts from outside and bringing them back to the front of the store in hot weather, at my particular Safeway there was a constant leak in the roof I had to clean up regularly as well as the occasional bathroom cleaning. If it sounds like a lot that is because it is, but on its own I think a janitor would be another job they should be hiring for because you also are responsible for doing all of that while bagging groceries at the front end during rush hours. It can be a rush or a drag but usually always stressful. And the pay is completely unfair at 10.5 an hour."
Safeway,1ej0dvpeju1dj800,3.0,"My time at Safeway was more or less a good experience. When you first start out, everyone is really nice and willing to help out! Over time the management seemed to not care anymore. The pay started out at minimum wage and I was able to get a small raise of 50 cents after working 6 months"

Safeway,1eirgsks8ree1800,2.0,"I started tis job when I was 17, I am now 35 and it has become a really bad place to work. Ever since Albertsons has taken over the work enviormnemnt has gone down. This used to be a career and employees were paid fair, but now every time a contract come up the pay does not go up that much. I can't even earn a living wage in the area that I live."
Safeway,1eiol7h3gsqbl800,3.0,Overall have made some good friends here but the pay and lack there of is terribly!! And when you ask management they always tell you talk to the union who is no one or no where to be found!! No benefits as everyone is considered part time unless a manager!!
Safeway,1einvf8o9ree1800,4.0,"Good environment. Not enough pay for a full time job  wish there was better benefits and a better store manage, one that cares about his/her workers overall other workers are nice"
Safeway,1eimeo9s1of3u800,2.0,I worked as a fruit cutter. Our department (fruit and vegetable cutting) was always understaffed while management kept expecting us to crank out more and more chopped fruits and veggie packages while still going out onto the floor every hour to check and document the temperature of the cooling racks where our produce is displayed. Most afternoons I was left to chop alone and that was no fun! The one good thing I got from this job was learning how to cut fruits efficiently. I wouldn't recommend this position (or probably most positions here - the people working here could be rather iffy).
Safeway,1eik6lfveocr4800,1.0,"This place was highly abusive toward its employees. They would regularly shift you to multiple departments in a day due to a shortage of staffing and payroll and expect you to get 16-20 hours of work done in an 8 hour shift without any aid. Management was verbally abusive, disrespectful, and condemning if there was any failure to complete all tasks and expectations within the small time frame given, regardless of how quickly and efficiently you worked. Breaks were a rare commodity. Working for Safeway was easily the most toxic and abusive workplace I have ever been a part of."
Safeway,1eik1leg5u1dj800,5.0,Nothing better then being surrounded daily with great people. It's like being independently contracted for your position with some mention of what works for another co-worker if needed.
Safeway,1eijg9f86ree1800,1.0,"This was one of the worst companies I have ever worked for. The management is abusive, the store manager should be fired. She was the worst manager I ever worked for. She made the work environment toxic and let other department heads be abusive to the employees with no consequences. The union is worthless too. Save your money and work elsewhere."
Safeway,1eihjtpqksqbl800,3.0,Loved my job until the Store manager was relocated and the assist store manager took his place. It all went down hill fromthere. She saw to it that I was replaced.

Safeway,1eic9as5iree1800,3.0,"During the interview process, I was asked to come back 3 separate times. The first was with a supervisor who worked in a department that had nothing to do with the Pharmacy, and had no idea the questions to ask for a pharmacy position. The second person to interview me was another supervisor that had no idea I was applying for the Pharmacy Tech position. The third interviewer was the pharmacy manager who was 2 weeks new himself and had no idea there was even an existing position open. And he was telling me that he really had no idea how badly unorganized this store was until he started working there."

Safeway,1ehvt6p3dro7r800,3.0,Store atmosphere is set by the manager. My store. Current long time employees have said they have seen better managers than the one now in control. We have a micro manager who has stripped department heads of decision making powers.

Safeway,1eht9vk5crd6i800,4.0,was my first job as a teen and I enjoyed it. Better then working at fast food. Was a simply job and fun. Started as courtesy clerk and then worked in the bakery department.
Safeway,1ehso1o3hrct1800,4.0,"My review about Safeway is a good 1st job experience.  It was my 1st time working in a different state. Safeway is people friendly , very professional."
Safeway,1ehrpvdtvro7r800,3.0,My time with Safeway was productive in that I learned people skills and the pay was good at the time. It was a good job for putting myself through college.
Safeway,1ehr1uahvro7r800,3.0,Cashier/Customer Service
Safeway,1ehqmrmsnrct1800,4.0,I worked for Safeway. I worked in the Starbucks kiosk for most of the starting and then was offered by management 40 hours. They offered an ask if i would like to work deli starting and end shift in at the kiosk. Theirs a career you can start with Safeway.
Safeway,1ehq8oj5cro7r800,3.0,Working at Safeway taught me a lot. I am working toward my goal by learning patience at my job to prosper my dreams in the future. I like learning new things & opportunities. Overall I thank safeway for hiring me .
Safeway,1ehns1jf7olkt800,5.0,"This was a great job as I worked for Safeway in the 80s this was a great addition for my resume, I worked as in-house security/undercover this job was shoplift only no Internal investigations, also worked a large area from Fresno, Clovis, Visalia to Merced."
Safeway,1ehnfs2tqolkt800,2.0,"The disrespectful management, discrimination, favoritism that shows through scheduling, the hours constantly being cut, the 20 plus things expected to be done within a 5 hour shift."
Safeway,1ehm5kfmr3dko000,1.0,My supervisor is an immature total control freak and hypocrite. I am assigned fewer days than those who were hired after me. I was sent home for having taken off my face mask to get a drink of water.
Safeway,1ehm0cpql3dko000,3.0,"Over all I believe the management and employees of Safeway are doing the best they can because most complaints I have are more on the corperate end. For being ""essential"" and the back bone of smaller communities the company does little if anything to help their employees. Raises are very hard to get even if you've workered for the company for years and it seems that the company as a whole is quite unorganized. It's a great stepping stone but I personally could never consider it a career. Good healthcare if it's what you're working for."
Safeway,1ehlecq90377s000,2.0,"Lots of friendliness, but turns into high school. The workers been there for 20 yrs. and more. They say one thing, then change their minds and says another thing. Lots of miscommunication and lack of communication. Gets confusing at times because even the managers doesn’t know what’s going on. The ones that’s been there for 20 yrs. and more tries to act younger than a teenager  sometimes. Lots of favoritism from management and lots of kissing derrières. I’ve seen workers come and go easily, and told that managers can’t make up their minds."
Safeway,1ehl875ttrapg800,5.0,Very nice people but they got angry if you were standing still not doing anything. You couldn't take time off. Needed to be doing something at all times
Safeway,1ehkrpch7rapg800,4.0,It’s a great place to interact with your community. You get to learn many things about people and form new connections. They are flexible about scheduling as long as you ask beforehand!
Safeway,1ehglkte33dko000,2.0,"The plus side is that unless you're caught stealing, there's almost no reason you will be fired from this company. I've had co-workers come to work hours late and leave hours early on a nearly weekly basis and never be fired. The work itself doesn't tend to be too difficult and can absolutely be accomplished if you have a decent team. Management is an absolute joke, though. My first department manager regularly made degrading sexist jokes (with customers, too) and racist comments - then got promoted up into HR. My current department manager gets 5 coffees a day, stands to the side of the kiosk on her phone directly outside of the kiosk talking to other employees or friends while I'm dealing with a rush alone, and then spends hours in the back either on her phone or talking when her tasks should take one hour at the most. Store management is aware and is ""working to address the issues"", but this has been going on for nearly a year so I don't have much hope. It's a really good job if you're just looking to make some cash while you go to school or something, but the work environment management creates is so terrible that I would never choose this job as my livelihood. You'll just end up miserable and feeling like you have no out because hey, bills have to be paid, right?"
Safeway,1ehg9nh0arapg800,5.0,I only worked here for a short time in the deli. Its pretty busy but if you are good at customer service this will not be a difficult job. Most of the customers were nice as well. My supervisor and manager were very helpful during my training and showed their appreciation for my work.
Safeway,1eheb4epf3dko000,1.0,"I spent 13 years with this company. I’ve seen hundreds of people come and go. And like any other Fortune 500 company, your just a number.  This company could careless about your or your family."
Safeway,1ehdrvgr0r5q5800,4.0,"Despite the rather stale environment I was working in, it was the people that I was working with that kept me going. A few of the people I worked with were around my age and I could easily converse with. Most of the older folk there were also nice and supportive. Despite the constant disarray at the workplace due to a lack of efficient management, everything seemed to always work out in the end."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1ehcvgfih3dko000,2.0,Management only helps when someone is about to quit. I haven’t once seen them do anything reacting to a deli manager taking out her frustration on her team. It disappoints me that is allowed to happen in any way shape or form.
Safeway,1ehbtj3klre7j800,2.0,"Safeway was the first job I ever worked at and it taught me a lot about customer service and how to engage with customers. Work environment was alright, my schedule was all over the place and changed every week so it was hard to plan for events and school. The pay was not worth dealing with rude customers."
Safeway,1eh8v3145qboo800,2.0,"In the beginning the manager said school is important and they are flexible with my schedule.  I barely get 3 days of 5 hours and when I'm at my check stand I cant talk to any coworkers. I have to be quiet and I get yelled at when I ask about my schedule for example I called last week because it was a 6am to 2pm on a Friday when I have a class, from 8am to 4pm, my manager yelled at me and said I picked the days when I clearly didnt and made a big deal about it.  I've told her my schedule multiple times and she still doesn't remember. Honestly I feel like she doesn't even care."
Safeway,1eh84vvnqovqa800,1.0,"Safeway in Chelan is the dirtiest, grossest grocery store I have EVER been to the management just doesn't care. The store itself is dirty and the break room upstairs is covered in insects."
Safeway,1eh848q6drd21800,4.0,"I love most of my coworkers and management, unfortunately we are being asked to do more with less time all the time without the compensation to reflect that in my opinion."
Safeway,1eh6stk02ohbb800,5.0,"Worked off and on for 3-4 years, always been a good job, you get to meet new people every day and get work experience for other grocery stores. It’s a good job to get paid weekly."
Safeway,1eh6bip4dp0ml800,2.0,"My co-workers where my only solace, i was overworked, underpaid, mocked and threatened by management and district manager The only con was that we got to have Thanksgiving and Xmas potluck."
Safeway,1eh60ut8grd4s800,4.0,"They are flexible with hours, especially if you are in school. You also get all of your requested days off. Most of the managers are nice and easygoing unless you slack off. They always make sure you get your scheduled breaks and lunch. Depending on the department, the environment is very chill and welcoming. Overall a fun and easy place to work."
Safeway,1eh5g5nvtregs800,3.0,"Production is key, a lot of little jobs within the scope of every days work assembly/requirements  Customer service oriented, Busy enough to make the shift go by quickly, which I liked.  Nice people to work with.  I felt bad for the customer when the product they needed was not available.  I liked the evening closing schedule."
Safeway,1eh3it5b3oh9o800,5.0,"Affordable deals every week, friendly attitudes, easy product locations, sanitized environment, fresh varieties, helpful guidance, employee discounts, and more!"
Safeway,1eh3fmiqboh9o800,5.0,I think the job is great but it the Employees in the store convince to leave because they didn’t take their job seriously and made feel I did all the work and held the store down.
Safeway,1eh36ipmgqh1c800,1.0,This company and the CEO are distressing along with the managers. I have seen over and over the treatment of new workers by the seasoned workers you have a high turnover along with poor treatment of new workers. I have seen hard working people just quit because the favoritism is to much. It seems that the CEO could give a concern about the high turnover rate in your store. It is not a fun place to work at all.
Safeway,1eh2tn6fvrd28800,1.0,"I have never worked for a company and store mgr. and been treated so unfairly and rude. I don’t think the store mgr. know compassion. I have continually worked hard for this company and it customers, but working in this environment cause me to have a stress break, and even then still no compassion form anyone who works there. I a great worker, my boss wants to fire me for unimportant reasons. Thank god, I have a union to back me up."
Safeway,1eh2mm6ehp0lc800,4.0,● Overall
Safeway,1eh0tqkjup0lc800,2.0,It's really hard to find a good quality Safeway with proactive and trustworthy managers who  truly support their team! But you can get promoted quickly!
Safeway,1egudt5v4oet1800,1.0,"Never got support from upper management, got yelled at put down by Dept management. Store manager has no clue to what’s going on, he would rather ask for a resignation rather than deal with the real problem. Asking someone to resign from a position and go to another Dept instead of fixing the problem at hand. Very sad that I wasted almost 2 years of my life thwre"
Safeway,1egtc3d1l3cfd000,3.0,"I was worngfuly accused of things and put on unpaid leave. Took a temporary job for money and decided to take it on full time. When I was called back to safeway and told all allegations were found false, dropped and asked to come back to work I stated that I will take on full-time. Weeks later I was told my name was put under do not hire based on a no call no show then do not hire based off job abandonedment. I was one of four people in the store able to work all departments and worked fine with everyone. Because two managers hire up in the store did not want me there they had two employees make false allocations in order to fire me. Once again they were found false by HR after an unpaid leave. I was always on time, always dependable and always professional. I ask that my reputation be replaced in order to reflect that!"
Safeway,1egro4g7hqh1c800,1.0,"I was bullying into quite because I found mold and other problems, and reported them to the store manager. The head backer also was not practicing safe work place skills"
Safeway,1egmb165sbfjv800,5.0,"Everyday people are happy to be there, the management is always pushing to strive for a better store, the employees care about their job it’s an overall great experience to work there."
Safeway,1egku38tkbfjv800,2.0,"It starts out lovely! My co workers were all so friendly and kind..the lead decorator soon started to show their side. They were two faced depending if you screwed up, it not worth the stress and anxiety. You need connections within to be able to stay there.. The managers all have favorites and will put the work on someone else not caring whether you had time or not. If you want to become a successful cake decorator beware of the lead decorator breathing down your back."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1egf0s1i5re2b800,2.0,"was a pretty basic night shift stocking job. Paid alright for what it was I guess, hours were alright, management was distant and uninvolved, high expectation of productivity in terms of speed. Short breaks. No benefits."
Safeway,1egda97hbre2b800,3.0,"If you have a regular clerk position you'll probably be fine. Your manager will define your experience with this company, whether it be a great experience or an absolute nightmare."
Safeway,1egd45oimre2b800,3.0,I enjoyed the pleasant attitude of my co-workers. Friendly environment for learning new experiences. It was an overall positive experience and helped me improve my skills further.
Safeway,1egcj7ikkre2b800,4.0,Safeway was an easy going some what stress free worlk environment.  Management was there when you needed them. I had 6 weeks a year for time off and 2 weeks for personal or sick usage. Overall the company treats you fair
Safeway,1eg9ulnmgs4v4800,5.0,fun to see progress towards making our community want to shop with us. Good people to work with and most everyone enjoys the fast pace of the grocery store.
Safeway,1eg5svl61re2b800,3.0,This job was okay at first. Then the night crew grocery manager started going out of her way to constantly harass me and almost sabotage me. The final straw was the disgusting false rumors she was making about me. In reality I had a death in the family and had to miss a day but I hope one day she changes. The way she treated people of color was extremely disgusting as well.
Safeway,1eg54pquf3djs000,1.0,● Work-life balance
Safeway,1eg41vha33djs000,5.0,"I worked at Safeway during the COVID-19 pandemic. Employees followed state and county regulations to keep customers safe. My experience at Safeway was positive. I received a raise after a short period of time working there. However, many employees complained."
Safeway,1efuhd00br572800,1.0,"The company is no longer what it used to be. They don't appreciate their employees. Or their well being or their health. The work load is heavy. They won't train you correctly they expect a computer to train you. They don't promote within. They rather allow someone outside that does not care to come in and run a store. Seasoned senior employees know more than highly paid salary individuals. But it isn't about what you know its about who you know and numbers. You can care and have ideas. But if it isn't controlled by an algorithm it doesn't matter. The bolts and screws of the company is old. With no hopes of stepping into the future. They can't keep department managers or staff.. They want you to put in your 2weeks notice for respect of the business, but if you are terminated (not for any loss to the company's assets) they don't give you 2 weeks. You'll be lucky to get your accumulated time in a timely manner. There is a bunch of grey areas that YOU have to figure out. While not having enough staff again your work load is heavy and so is the paperwork. They have a no cell phone policy yet individuals will take pictures and send them to you while on and off the clock. And then include you in group chats just to harass you on your off days. And the cliques don't get me started with those. You have store managers that talk down to their employees so bad that the employees are afraid to speak up. And these store managers are protected even though they twist the truth to their higher superiors and fix it so that previous employees can not come back. Are you going to college forget"
Safeway,1efug7qj1bfgm800,3.0,"My position wasn't set, each day I was expected to do something different from what I did the last day, and sometimes I would be told last minute to stop what I was doing and do something different and each week I would work different hours, sometimes even less than 20 hours a week. The managers weren't very good at communicating and sometimes even get into arguments with eachother. I wasn't making much money and most days didn't feel as though I was appreciated."
Safeway,1efs5r5olr572800,1.0,"I have never worked somewhere so draining. I feel like my life and yours, is not valued at all, which is clear by how they've handled the pandemic. They are more worried about losing money, its always been about that. 4 people in my department  have left because of COVID-19. I’m pregnant so I worried if this would be worth the minimum wage pay, and so did my coworkers. The response from management was irresponsible and just a way for them to ignore the issue. They had us sign a contract that says we cannot work if we have been tested, even though the only people we've been in contact with is our coworkers and many of us cant afford to do that. Instead we just haven't gotten tested and hoped we aren't hurting anyone else. Im working overtime every week and my boss says it isn’t enough, I didn't think it would be so difficult to work like this but being pregnant is no joke. I feel unappreciated and like i've been taken advantage of."
Safeway,1efqf1bfgol7u800,3.0,The job was rather lackadaisical with a constant flow of day-in and day-out customers. I was given my store clerk duties and worked their at every present moment I could.
Safeway,1efpm28p9q31i800,1.0,"At start there was 3 AWESOME LADIES in charge of this program. Once they were reassigned it went down hill !! Shoppers didn’t complete customers orders, theft before items put on truck, lack of supervisors support,harassment and overwhelming favoritism !!"
Safeway,1efpf6ocjbfgm800,1.0,I would never work for this sexist company. Worst experience on a job ever.  quit without any notice and ran as fast as I could away from this company
Safeway,1efobljnk38g4000,4.0,its a treat when I get to help the customer find what they want and have good conversations. they always love to come back and ask for me to help them and that is the best feeling.
Safeway,1efl6pbh43chj000,4.0,"If something came up unexpectedly I could get the time off quickly and easily, never had a problem with scheduling. I had no problem with the job in any way, it was great."
Safeway,1efkivo52bfgm800,1.0,"Safeway used to be just an OKAY place to work. Since ALBERTSONS took over it sucks... they cut hours and staff because their sales are down, and what happens when you cut staff? The customers suffer and the workers suffer by having to deal with more work. The ONLY good thing about working here is the health insurance, it is cheap and it is okay insurance."
Safeway,1efk5avnk3chj000,5.0,My job was good while it lasted I wish I could have stayed but I got shorted my hours because of the pandemic. My job was fair when I first started off.
Safeway,1efj1esverdm2800,4.0,Safeway has room to grow and move up in the company as long as you are dedicated and hard working. Safeway maintains a high standard and expects it employees to as well. We are throughly trained for almost any situation that may occur.
Safeway,1efi4t1da3gjj000,3.0,"I was with safeway for almost 5 years. Met some of the best and worst people there. Depending on union/nonunion, if you ask for any days off they’ll only give you 40 hours. Management overall will hardly help out, and expect unrealistic expectations. Favoritism is definitely a huge thing, especially at the Dillon Safeway. I’ve seen great employees quit or talk about how they hate working there because they’ll favor someone who doesn’t do their job at all. Just be careful and don’t take any smack - but at the same time you’ll not be treated fairly."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1efhve1gcoeug800,1.0,"Forget this place and run. Management is horrible and play favoritism.Very unfair.  Employees are treated very badly if you're not a favorite even if you're  a good worker.Over worked and under played, doing 2 to 3 people's jobs every day."
Safeway,1efdku7vup1h1800,2.0,Don't do it. It's so corporate they dont care about anything but money. You will work Thanksgiving and Christmas along with all of the other holidays. They close stores and lay off 20 plus year employees. No employee appreciation what so ever
Safeway,1efcu7po4oeea800,1.0,I’m on the front line and make minimum wage this job is Worth it I’d rather do something better...Customers yelling your face management does not back you up
Safeway,1efcu1euapbqj800,2.0,"Work schedule is flexible but they pay very low rate. I worked very hard for my position as a cashier but they never consider a better raise than what is printed in the handbook ($.50/year), unless you have to tell the store manager/ department manager that they have to pay you better. Management is terrible - when it's busy they have you clock out at the scheduled time and stay longer to finish the work unpaid. It's a good place to practice customer service skills, though."
Safeway,1efcqsa21pbqj800,4.0,My only issue is that they do not allow us to have water in our work area. I believe during the summer heat stroke or dehydration should be more of a concern.
Safeway,1efcme61joe9o800,5.0,It was a great place to work. I had the opportunity straight out of the military and if I didn't have to move back to Florida I would have stayed employed there. Great staff and atmosphere for anyone to walk into.
Safeway,1ef89jd1k3dkl000,3.0,"I was hurt while working, reported it to my supervisor. Instead of taking me into the office immediately, she went home. The following day I told her once again and was told it's past 24 hours, we can't report it."
Safeway,1ef7nrtuhrcmp800,1.0,● Work-life balance
Safeway,1ef778di03dkl000,4.0,Cutbacks have been a disappointment but enjoy the position. I enjoy the position as it is less stressful than a freestanding drugstore environment. Rural pharmacy practice is more personal and more satisfying.
Safeway,1ef4q4v43rcmp800,4.0,I love working there everyone is like one big family always helping and supporting everyone! Everyone is very hardworking and makes sure that every customer is satisfied.
Safeway,1ef4q0k7nrcmp800,3.0,"A job that is for young men and women to experience a high intense job that you can learn to gain good communication skills, cleanliness, and work ethic."
Safeway,1ef4k0jsspbqj800,5.0,Safeway is a great company especially if you want to move up and further your career. They have great benefits and excellent Job security also local 400 is awesome with helping you with situation that happen in life. I love Safeway and the respect I have for myself I show that to my customer so that they have a great experience when they come in and shop their. It's all about them at the end of the day.
Safeway,1ef3ftj5q3dkl000,5.0,It wasn't more than I could manage. It's what you would expect working as a cashier in a grocery store. The manager was nice. When I had trouble working with the computer he helped me out. The customers weren't too bad actually.
Safeway,1ef095kacoeea800,3.0,Managers and store director need all of help! Very unprofessional and lack communication. Hired with one day a week unavailable but store director forgets and doesn’t honor your availability and schedules and makes you commit to working outside of your availability.
Safeway,1eevmrq1soeea800,3.0,"I have been at Safeway for 4 years and I have had good and bad experiences working there. It is fast pace, fun, and always something to do. What I love about it is meeting new people everyday."
Safeway,1eeutc2i7rcmp800,5.0,● Work-life balance
Safeway,1eeu4b5lu3dkl000,2.0,The job itself was very easy. Crazy customers who can not read or argue with you over things corporate controls is what makes the job hard. Having managers who do not support you and keep with company policy is what makes this job almost impossible.
Safeway,1eep8k2hfovm7800,5.0,Great management team. So much loyalty from employees and management. Room for advancement. Decent pay and amazing Union benefits!
Safeway,1eep7me44ohac800,4.0,"They had good working employees but some some didn’t do there job. They didn’t give people the hours they asked for. Pushing the carts was very hard, especially up a big hill. And dealing with the bottle machine is gross and stressful."
Safeway,1eellf4umr1m4800,3.0,Too much favoritism. Makes it hard to.get hours pay rate is unfair..
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1eelb8rjc32l7000,1.0,"I loved my job at Safeway when I worked for the Dublin store, but then I transferred to a store in Sacramento and the manager here is very unprofessional, unreliable, and he doesn't keep his word! It's been almost 2 weeks and I'm still waiting for him to give me a start date! I shouldn't have to call more than once about a job I already have, I should just be given a start date and that's it. I have a child to care for and bills to pay"
Safeway,1eejhlsk2ohdo800,2.0,I’ve been here a year.  I am exactly where I started.  No hope of going further.  Management in the dot com dept is poor.  Substandard equipment and trucks. Little or no support from management.  Have to fight other departments to get my job done.  Most days I arrive at work already set up for failure.  $afeway is just a money machine worried about bottom line then employees satisfaction safety and Heath.  Oh and apparently there’s a union but they don’t help either.  Not a place to work if you have integrity and a solid work ethic.
Safeway,1eeh4lqacrnir800,5.0,It’s a good work Place Everyone Work as a team all the time They make sure your safe and okay keep u energy on a good level I learn so much things Things I didn’t even know I could do my mangers are Very hard workers
Safeway,1eeg189qqp0aq801,1.0,"When you're ""getting trained"", they only train you for maybe two days and then expect you to know what you're doing. The management as well as trainers treat you as if you aren't a good employee when you make one little mistake. Aside from training, the people also claim to be very professional, especially when it comes to certain situations involving customers, but when a fellow employee messes up even a minor thing, they get pulled aside in front of everyone. I felt as if I didn't really learn anything from working here. There's nothing enjoyable about working here, it's just more and more stress not to mention poor treatment of other employees."
Safeway,1eefuoo70ohdo800,3.0,"From what I saw when working everyone has different experiences. Depending on how the store is store is run, it's a good job or a horrible job.  I didn't hate the job, but I wouldn't go back after leaving. Management is not concerned about the employees.  They don't always give someone to cover the mantory breaks unless it's for front end employees. Front end gets better treatment when it comes to breaks.  The stores almost want to create competition by the seniority in hours,but when someone ask for less hours (do to school) they don't care  and department managers will schedule employee how they see fit.  Asking for time off is a nightmare too.  Don't get to attach to any one person because it's revolving door for employees. A lot of employees come and go. As I said every Safeway will be different since there's no consistency between managers and stores."
Safeway,1eeeeuf5v3dsv000,2.0,Don't go there. Everyone practically is part time. A lot of nepotism and favoritism. Poor supervision. They tire out the good workers and play with the nepotism favorites.
Safeway,1eeduj30ur4b0800,3.0,"I became assistant manager for the Jomba Juice stand with in the store. I stocked, inventoried, food prep, served in the deli, customer service, answered phones, managed schedules, and trained new hires."
Safeway,1eedrapi6rekg800,3.0,It’s a good way for someone who has no job experience and needs some to get some but to work with the people and environment it’s not worth it. There is absolutely no privacy and no respect in the matter and it’s overall a toxic place to work. If you were to call in and tell them a private reason the whole store would know by the end of the day and also there is major favoritism and if your not liked by a person above you the you can forget about hours and the respect you deserve.
Safeway,1eeca8f9sorug800,4.0,"Had lots of fun everyday, maybe too laid back of a place, but alright pay. Didn't want to fire bad employees though. My front end managers were awesome."
Safeway,1eec0smdms3gi800,1.0,So many management changes in the last 3 years. Coders are not recognized for having and maintaining your credentials. Pay is the same no matter the specialty. The easiest Primary Care non certified coders are paid the same as certified specialized coders in Surgery and Trauma. Doesn’t make any sense. It’s who you know and not what you know!
Safeway,1eebleqssp1eq800,5.0,"I enjoyed working with the people there and learn g new things, at times it was stressful on hollidays when the store was completely full but that is expected"
Safeway,1ee9t5pabpjmm800,4.0,"Store is always under staffed, 2 people on the front end checking (on peak usually) and thats just the front end. Union/benefits are decent but for the lack of coverage, unless youre capped pay, work isnt worth it"
Safeway,1ee9kip3nf333800,1.0,"This is the worst job on earth! They paid me 300$ for a 60 hr week cuz my store director hates me.. union did nothing! The deli manager was the best person on earth And that’s why I’m still here..also cuz I can’t find work anywhere else. You don’t get benefits till two years in!!! I started this job with 3,000$ savings..(.and I don’t buy things for my self) and now I’m 1,000$ in debt .. cuz ... how can you live on 800$ a month"
Safeway,1ee9c5shkp1eq800,3.0,Have had work for the company for 15 yrs . 10 of them had work for overnite shifts . Always asked to move to mornings shifts or afternoon shifts .. and never happend .always shirt hand it .just myself in the store stocking and makings orders .have to quit because of strees and company no willing to get extra emplooyes
Safeway,1ee6l819oohdi800,2.0,"I worked there for awhile, not a bad workplace. But management is unorganized and short tempered with staff.  The co workers are great, really good people."
Safeway,1ee6k0m69semq800,5.0,All you have to do it just come in with a positive attitude and just continue to focus and stay positive. Overall my time with the company was good I have nothing bad to say.
Safeway,1ee5rt9uaf31t800,1.0,"If you’re looking to apply to the King City Safeway, do yourself a huge favor and don’t waste your time. This company is not concerned with the success and well being of its employees - in fact quite the opposite. Management is shifty, dismissive and full of empty promises, they say one thing and do another with or without formal notice. Be sure you get EVERYTHING written down, Management frequently “was never present in that situation” “don’t recall what you’re talking about” “never said that...” Basically on their end, it never happened. Harassment and bullying is quite common here, but forget about having HR and Management deal with these problems, all you’ll get is “I don’t deal with drama, I just sell groceries” and have no knowledge or practice of policy and procedure. I worked for this company for 4 years and it’s truly the most toxic work environment I’ve ever been in. Every week you will fight for hours, fight for a pay raise, fight for respect, fight for proper training, fight for PPE, and fight to be paid correctly on your weekly stubs. I was so hopeful for a successful experience at Safeway but it was the most stressful situation I’ve ever encountered. If you respect yourself enough, look for better work, I promise you it’s out there. You are so worth it!"
Safeway,1ee3c5o6irg5d800,3.0,Great place to work in overall good people to work with. The management was poor .i loved the people I worked with mostly and the customers where great.
Safeway,1ee24ggudr5t2800,3.0,Place is extremely toxic and metric driven but pay is great. The particular DPM slaves people which is typical of most Indians anyways. He throws people under the bus and makes people fear him
Safeway,1ee1s4pgjohdi800,3.0,"Safeway has a good work environment and has clear descriptions on the weight each person carries. Although every person had clear objectives, there was never enough people to satisfy the needs of the store and the costumers in a timely manner."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1ee17hjourefl800,3.0,I found working at Safeway to be an overall okay experience. Its any typical customer service job with wonky hours. I wished the hours were better as well as the pay.
Safeway,1ee0kokbaohdi800,1.0,In arizona it was anything like vons in California were they pay 14-18 bucks an hour. Northern arizona they paid like that. Washington Oregon it was a decent job as well. In phoenix Scottsdale area. They want every cent out of you. They work every penny out of you and only pay the least they can. Box truck driving isn't worth it. Part time? Minimum wage ? To check the oil level in a truck? Other companies like Macdonald's and jiffy lube valvoline will pay more for less work. Part time truck driving and they want you to drive far and dont work you close to home. Same as the store. I worked in a store in Scottsdale and they always promised to move me closer to home and never didn't. They wouldn't and couldn't find a replacement to move me and others closer to home. They didn't pay enough money for all the work they asked. They didn't treat anyone fairly. They manager they picked over me had no idea what they were doing. They had no experience and I over qualified for their job. And they didn't pick me. They don't pay enough and it shows. They run their team ragged while a manager just gets paid to chill..worst job ever. In other places they paid workers a livable wage. In Phoenix and Scottsdale they don't pay anything..
Safeway,1edvv7riv3dpb000,2.0,"Safeway seems to be a family buisness and has a lot of friendly faces coming through, they are very competitive and always want to push themselves to be the best!"
Safeway,1edvupkhrohdi800,4.0,I worked in deli. It is a very high stress enviroment. The pay is minimal for the amount of work that is asked for minimal amount of personnel. High stress and not enough time to get it all done. Makes it frustrating to work and feel accomplished.
Safeway,1edvckps131q3000,5.0,Overall great company to work for. Greatest attitude overall. Every section had a way of doing things and running to Safeway standards. other employees cross trained to help another section in need.
Safeway,1edsucgfereb4800,1.0,hard labor they don't appreciate the hard work .the union dont help.u are mandatory to work the weekends.wont give you time off.the work is not worth the pay
Safeway,1edstkqe1reb4800,5.0,"There’s not much I can say about the company. Very fast paced, have to have good work ethic. Once you know a lot of positions they expect a lot from you."
Safeway,1edss7cdrsemq800,3.0,"Not a bad place for young teens, union was a major perk, the staff became like my second family and work was my second home. I worked there for 2 years and I learned a lot about growing up, repsonsibilities, and being part of the workforce."
Safeway,1edsbrskjqfn0800,3.0,"Whether you are a stocker, cashier, bagger, etc, you are constantly asked questions by customers. This gives you a pressure of putting a smile on your face all day and feeling exhausted from it when you go home."
Safeway,1edrehsgp3dq5000,1.0,"The motto “Courtesy, Dignity and Respect” is what they state but not what they do. My people were great but my boss and a few people who stomp on you to get ahead were awful. I was humiliated, harassed, bullied and backstabbed on a daily basis. I ended up on medication."
Safeway,1edqcths03hqm000,5.0,"In the entire Three years of me working for this company I learned how to interact with a very Diverse amount of people. the People that came to me asking for my help, spoke many Diverse languages that I didn't understand. But I did my best to understand them and help them."
Safeway,1edmr4fntre34800,1.0,Didn’t like it at all. I hated it. I was stuck with nothing but closing shifts. Never received real training and was told I was hired to be full time but was let go after holiday season
Safeway,1edmonbeerdfk800,4.0,I like working for Safeway but they don’t pay good for the amount of work you do. They should look at that and make sure one of the important people of the company get pay better.
Safeway,1edk118qarei2800,4.0,"I have worked at Safeway for about 2 years as a courtesy clerk. For the past 5 months I’ve been in different departments as well. The managers are very good at making sure each employee is working in a department that suits their strong point and skills. Very cooperative with strict time schedules, they work with you around school hours, and understand when life happens and you need to call in."
Safeway,1edjrg7d4rg31800,3.0,I have worked for Safeway for 20 years. The best part about the job is that there are normally good people working there with you. The hardest part is the lack of help and your supposed to do it all without support. Then you are likely to get blamed for the things you might not get finished. This is why it has it's stresses and everyone feels it.
Safeway,1edist5murei2800,1.0,The management at this Safeway was the worst! Somehow having a management position made you feel very powerful while your employees are treated badly.  My supervisor was the worst when it came to training and then to listen and watch her behavior with customers was an embarrassment. I not only quit my job there I no longer shop there.
Safeway,1edg8gn58rdlg800,3.0,"I worked for Safeway for a year and a half and worked very hard at my job. I enjoyed it, there were struggles, but struggles come with all jobs. I had great coworkers and my manager helped me with my struggles."
Safeway,1edf5rvobrddu800,2.0,"I never minded the job personally. I worked in the produce department and the only real issue I had was the disconnect between us the workers and the corporate/ management teams. We're expected to live up to these expectations and get chewed out when we don't meet them or we do meet them but still get chewed out because it wasn't ""their way""."
Safeway,1ededo9vpp2ng800,1.0,You will never get support from anyone or anywhere in Safeway. They are mentally and verbally abusive. There is entirely too much gossiping and intimate relationships within the company.
Safeway,1edcilrodp15k800,2.0,Over the past 10 years Safeway has treated me really well as an employee. Unfortunately there's not much room for growth and very little job security.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1ed75te0ar4eh800,5.0,I enjoy working at chi but my until has been closed off and on for a year and I have had to float most days.  I feel co workers satisfaction is down in general but everyone is trying to maintain a sense of happiness.
Safeway,1ed6mm2dkro5q801,3.0,My experience was diminished by the lack of management skills at this particular store  Overall staff morale was low  Store was reportedly slated for closing
Safeway,1ed5h1gu233ur000,3.0,In the four years I've been with the company there have been a number of ups and downs but overall it is a great first job but not a career one should pursue.
Safeway,1ed4on7gfrf5g800,5.0,"It was a typical job for a high school student, that gave insight on the workplace for future employment and allowing for people to go higher in the chain. The people that worked their were nice and good at allocating times that fit into your schedule."
Safeway,1ed3r0t18rapu800,3.0,"Safeway is a great place to work for a few years. The pay is reliable and good for earning a bit on the side. Your schedule is sporadic, meaning you could lock-in at 6 am on one day, but 4 pm the next day."
Safeway,1ed1f5nc0ovgi800,4.0,"Happy, exciting, meaningful fellow employees and managers. Many hardworking, caring people trying to help our customers any way we can in our community. I love being a part of such a vast group of employees that enjoy what  we are doing for our customers, their, our families and community."
Safeway,1ed138gsgovgi800,3.0,They scheduling was bad. Only 8 hours off between shifts. Poor management and leadership. Poor training and they overwork there employees that's  all I  can think  for right  now
Safeway,1ecvb3gtmrmog800,1.0,The only long timers there were there before current management.   They won't leave because they're all close to retirement and are still getting pre union benefits. The current management doesn't know how to treat people and the turnover rate shows it.
Safeway,1ecsugd3ms34j800,4.0,"Safeway is a good company towards beginners who are looking for their first job. It’s quite easy to go through the flow of working though you will be asked to do other things outside what you’re applied for. While not a bad thing, you end up learning a bit more about the store itself."
Safeway,1ecspnmccqutf800,2.0,"Las personas que trabajan aca, tratan a los empleados como basura, los manager de los cuartos y lideres de linea, son personas sin educacion, ni respeto por los demas."
Safeway,1ecriivutp016801,2.0,"Terrible management and no advancement or pay raises, good workplace overall everyone was nice but management needs to change especially with the sanitation department"
Safeway,1ecr20fu1oh8g800,5.0,"Safeway was a great place to work , good benefits . A lot of different opportunities, to grow your with the skills you have also , flexible with school schedules ."
Safeway,1ecqtkiuloetn800,5.0,"I spent long enough here to know that it is a great company to work for. From starting as a high school student to working my way up to a career, i never had any problems."
Safeway,1ecodomuare3p800,3.0,"In general, it is pretty fast paced. There is rarely not something to do. However, when you run out of things to do, youre pretty much sol. Can get extremely boring or be extremely stressful. There's no inbetween."
Safeway,1eco73588qf9l800,2.0,"Might not occur at other locations but the store i work at has poor management, does not pay fairly for those who work management positions, store director plays favorites"
Safeway,1ecnkatprrie7800,4.0,They are very thoughtful towards people that have disabilities. Management is very kind towards employees other coworkers are thoughtful of others the good work environment and it's encouraging. And you will learn a lot about retail and how it runs with Safeway.
Safeway,1eclbpjn4ri2r800,1.0,"If you want to be talked down to, this is the place to go. They hire managers from slow stores and put them in busy stores so that they will cut the hours of all the employees making it virtually impossible to finish a task. Consistently getting called to check when you're trying to finish never finish a task because you only had one cashier"
Safeway,1eclaqp7nqg5h800,4.0,"It was a good enough job to pay the bills. The management was slightly below average in my opinion. They really didn't seem to listen to ideas or issues unless they viewed it as important to them, which lead to a lot of frustration. It felt like you were just another employee, a body to put in production or whatever job they needed you to serve. It was difficult to get time off, schedules can be brutal (swing to morning, morning to grave, grave to swing sometimes). The pay was great for the work I was doing, but the work/life balance was non-existent for years."
Safeway,1eckskgk1qnsr800,4.0,SAFEWAY INC. was strick percise on store policies. Management co UK ld improve employees worked well as a team. Shelves were nice neat readable if an item was sold out they would recommend a rebate. The prices could be better especially sale prices. Overall SAFEWAY INC. is a good place to shop.
Safeway,1eckq30ssqg5h800,5.0,Great place to work and move upwards. Had lots of help from different departments in order to succeed in my roll. Loved the work environment and coworkers.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1ecjdna2ordmg800,4.0,Great first job learned a lot about talking to customers and Really excelled when I worked in the Star Bucks Kiosk Was lots of fun would work here again.
Safeway,1ecircb9bqnsr800,3.0,I really enjoy most of the employees I work with for the most part but the management had obvious favoriyes. As a new worker you realize that nobody trains you properly they expect you to do ur job 100% complete without even properly training you for the job. Management is rude to the crew whenever it gets super busy. My hiring manager doesn't encourage anyone who's struggling and would go out of her way to tell that employees how bad they're doing instead of helping out. In my experience there... I would have to say its not a workplace I enjoy going to everyday. Strong 4-10
Safeway,1eci5tov5qnsr800,1.0,"No training, union job with lazy union workers expecting non union workers trying to get in to do most of the menial jobs. High union dues, never again."
Safeway,1ecfs531qrbdt800,3.0,"I had a lot of friends I worked with, but got tired of customer service. Work environment was good. There was room for growth and I had a lot of fun for the most part"
Safeway,1eceeip1erbdt800,2.0,"There are a lot of nice employees but a lot of the management is horrible. They play favorites, really don't care about most of the workers, and the pay is offensive. However, it's not a hard job at all."
Safeway,1ece8f5esp2pt800,4.0,A typical day at work is filled with constant things to get done. I have an ice case to set. Food safety to prepare for. Orders to maintain. Deadlines to meet. Customers to serve. Monthly inventory organization is important. I have learned how to handle a lot under pressure but find that I enjoy the challenges.
Safeway,1ecae946crbdt800,2.0,The Livermore store has a manager that only likes certain people and if you aren't one of them he will give you he'll.  Some of the individual department managers are good.
Safeway,1ec9vmn2kogmd800,4.0,"While the job offered some flexibility and lenience with scheduling, most of the benefits were not very apparent. Once you learned your job duties you come and get what you need done and not much more. Often you will find yourself either busy with monotonous work or finding that there isn't enough work, depending on day and location. It was an okay job overall, and I spent about 2 years as a cashier, 3 total. I wouldn't say it was unbearable but after a while you may find yourself bored if you are constantly looking for advancement or new opportunities for work tasks."
Safeway,1ec9grdp8rej6800,5.0,Great place to work. Management is fair and thoughtful.  Co workers are supportive and caring.  More available hours would make it a better place to work.
Safeway,1ec6m4nenoehq800,2.0,Safeway is a good start out job. The company is not what it use to be. Management has gone down hill. Almost every day someone calls in sick and nothing happens to them.
Safeway,1ec6f9khjrd28800,1.0,"I would recommend not working here because the management is terrible and they are in their office talking and eating all day. They make the cashiers and courtesy clerks do all the work. The scheduling is very bad you don’t have set anything (day off, days on) it changes every week and they only post 1 work week at a time."
Safeway,1ec5npu70rc0v800,3.0,"I didn’t think my over all time at Safeway was bad. There were some mangers I may have not agreed with, but I was still able to get along with them. I had to quit for personal reasons during the whole ongoing COVID-19 mess."
Safeway,1ec16j27vpc5k800,5.0,I love my work family. Every one there are great workers and we all get along. To me it reminds me of a little work house hold.
Safeway,1ebtqjkmcrdei800,5.0,Awesome District manager versal Excellent company work for always room for improvementI Been in the Businessover 35 years love everything about retail
Safeway,1ebq1u3dird28800,5.0,"Fun job , nice people. Becomes more like family after a while. Everyone enjoys seeing familiar faces and learn names quickly .safeway gave me a shot and I enjoy going to work everyday"
Safeway,1ebp4726qrdde800,2.0,I do not recommend Safeway to the people that want to work there for years due to the fact of their new contract. They don't get paid well it's a good job to have for a few months ONLY.
Safeway,1ebmcr783377e001,1.0,"I only worked here for two months and it had to be one of the worst jobs I've had. If you're hired to be a courtesy clerk, the management treats you horribly and the turnover rate is high. You're hardly given any hours and worked like a slave when you are there. You're constantly being watched by management in your every move and you'll get yelled at if you're caught doing anything wrong even if that's what you were trained to do, and they make it extremely obvious that they're watching you constantly. As courtesy clerks, we weren't given a pay increase like everyone else during the pandemic, even though we our putting our health at risk just as much. Don't work here unless you want to be treated like dirt while being paid minimum wage."
Safeway,1ebkeg1kiolj1800,1.0,"Did not like the job, more so the staff. I had a good few days until you start to see the mistreatment and violation of federal health standards. Thats that. I quit."
Safeway,1ebjngf1dr4ol800,5.0,Very good management and employees.  They are all friendly and patient with new hires. I am treated like I  belong there. The job is easy to learn.  Employees are always  happy
Safeway,1ebhcale2r4tq800,2.0,"As a seafood clerk, all I did was pull frozen shrimp off the shelves, thaw them out, and put them into the display cases... for the same price. The only purposeful part of my job was occasionally steaming shrimp for people. The quality of products is minimal and nothing is actually fresh. Everyone comes to buy our shrimp salad but it’s not special, literally look up “old bay shrimp salad” and it’s the same on google."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.

Safeway,1eb2h3s9lol1t800,2.0,"management could care less about you, they treat you like a slave, get upset when they don’t get what they want, and you’re guaranteed to always see them in a horrible, unsupportive mood. everyone is out for themselves, everyone. you can’t trust anyone (there are maybe a handful of good people who work there) and you won’t be able to have any benefits until you devote one year of your life to get paid time off, sick leave, and medical/dental insurance. if you are considering working at this Safeway in Payson, AZ, don’t waste your time... trust me"
Safeway,1eb0q2cibrmcj800,5.0,Love working there and even shopping there before I was even an employee. All employees love helping the customers through out the store. Always clean
Safeway,1eb05utvjrcb4800,4.0,Love working there they always keep everything clean and in order and workers are always willing to help someone out on the floor everything is always nice and always greeting you at the door
Safeway,1eatb9ksjrca3800,3.0,"When I first started at this job it was OK it was enough money to get me by I was happy with it at first and I realize that I wasn’t getting paid enough for what I was doing, scrubbing human feces"
Safeway,1easkpj3rol13800,4.0,"Extremely hard work! Have to keep your percentage up & that is solely based on speed. You have to stack boxes/orders all day more than 10ft high, you have to do it fast and then pull the stack on top of a pallet jack in an environment with lots of traffic (moving forklifts, pallet jacks etc.) ... The norm is 4 days on 3 days off ... except it’s my 13th day working straight in a row. If they have to they will work you on your day off but at least they tell you in advance. They are trying to weed out people in the beginning so expect to be working an insane amount of overtime for 10-11hrs per day."
Safeway,1easj0sjvqmif800,1.0,"I was hired && then let go because of something on my background.  They claim I was hired mid February but due to poor management communication,  I wasn't brought in to work till late March. I was then asked to step down the beginning of April, claiming because of something on my background, I wasn't a good candidate for the position I currently held.   They also had agreed to do a wage match when I started, but never came through with it.  Paying me 5$ an hour less then what they had agreed to in the beginning.  No one is ever available to speak to && the ppl that i have spoke with are never knowledgeable about what to do.  I WILL NEVER WORK FOR THIS COMPANY OR AFFILIATES IN THE FUTURE."
Safeway,1eaqrg6eupq4i800,4.0,"Working for Safeway was a good experience overall. From the interview process to your first day on the job, you feel as if you are part of a team and that they want you to succeed just as much as you do."
Safeway,1eapvh9pcpp8m800,1.0,I would give a big fat zero if I could not willing to work with my education share personal info and putting me on punishment duties no I feel ... Sanitation and closing bakery cleaning only forcing me to have to quit with min hours cannot feed my family and giving them to people who where hired after me...I hate safeway and the way the have been treating me
Safeway,1ealcll5eqmcq800,5.0,La compañia es bastante buena  hay buen ambiente de trabajo y de colaboracion .Sus beneficios y salarios son buenos y sobre todo oportunidades para crecer y hacer carrera si eres una persona que tiene ambicion y esta siempre con aptitud de aprender y crecer.
Safeway,1eak1i4csrcku800,5.0,Safeway was a cool job I really enjoyed it. I was cross trained on 5 positions which was awesome because I enjoy being well rounded in all job positions.
Safeway,1eaiaamipre9n800,1.0,customers were always harassing employees for stuff they couldn't control. Pay is not good unless you work there for 10+ years. Not enough staffing to meet the demands the store wanted.
Safeway,1eafiqaqfreha800,1.0,I hope you're all aware that the same people bagging your groceries also take care of the bathrooms every other hour. There's no training on bagging groceries either.
Safeway,1eafe8lgvrep1800,1.0,Worked on deli with no set standards. Food safety and proper equipment cleaning and handling is not a priority. Asking management for help with unsupervised staff problems made me a target for two years. I left and notified the health department during Covid19 because the poor practices were going to get someone ill.
Safeway,1eaf3dnfqrdqu800,4.0,I love working at safeway. Management is always willing to help and it's a fun loving atmosphere. I learn new things daily and my direct supervisor works directly alongside the department to help anywhere that he is needed.
Safeway,1ead15env3dh1000,3.0,If you want to get your foot in the door with the work force then this is a good experience. It’s not the most challenging job but you learn how to deal with people.
Safeway,1eacsebl83djs000,2.0,The work was good but if you're not part of a clique then you are not accepted by others. It's not the store that's bad it's about 90% of the employees that gossip continuously about others but yet they don't look at themselves and see there horrendous flaws
Safeway,1eabhuh7urch1800,2.0,"My experience at Safeway was not a very enjoyable one. The management side wasn’t well. The store manager was not very understanding of most employees situation and it seem as if he did not want to be involved with some areas of the store. Some employees weren’t very pleasant to be around, and the store I worked at had favoritisms to certain employees."
Safeway,1eab2fgsfrcbq800,3.0,"I made some good friends working here, of all ages. The job can be stressful and thankless like many other minimum wage jobs. My branch often promoted people hired after me, you have to go after promotions because they do not promote simply based on how long you've worked there."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1eaakvvd3rep2800,2.0,I've been lied to several times by this company and they are always quick to pass the blame when it hits the fan. I've worked for worse retail but Safeway is as cheap as the rest of them.
Safeway,1eaa7a6ker55c800,2.0,"Hardly any hours, they kept hiring more people for the same positions when there were no hours for employees already there. Management was terrible, very unprofessional"
Safeway,1ea8t95353dn2000,1.0,"Ever since Albertsons bought out Safeway, it has turned worse and worse. Management is to complacent, expect more out of you that what you’re required to do, want you to do manager things that you’re not getting paid to do. District Managers have no clue what they are doing, (never have worked in the department that they are over watching.) And if you are not liked in whichever department you are in they will cut your hours to try and get you to quit."
Safeway,1ea681amirenk800,1.0,"It honestly is not a bad beginner job. But I would get 7 3/4 hour shifts sometimes and I wasn't aloud to take a lunch, just two 15 minute breaks, sometimes just one if it was super busy. Which was horrible because not only was I hot, hungry and tired. It didn't seem fair that other people with 8 hour shifts were getting lunch while I worked an equally long shift and got no lunch. It was kind of their loop hole. The front end manager was always down everybody's neck so it seemed like more people would slack off when she was there. It's kinda funny that more work would get done when she wasn't there. I do not recommend you get a job here...sorry"
Safeway,1ea4dsoahrd71800,1.0,"The work they want done buy 1 individual is ridiculous, the stress level is toxic. They say 1 thing and then another, as long as it fits their need at the time.  Most of us employees that have lasted as long as I have find it hilarious when they say they care.  I’m here to tell you that the only thing that matters is the bottom line and there is no dignity or respect."
Safeway,1ea0st7f2ova5801,3.0,Working at Safeway as a part time employee was a pretty decent experience. The employees there are nice and it is a great environment. Management were very rude at times with most of the employees there when I was working and would criticize them for not working up to their standards. They also gave no real training for new employees at the store with most of them just being put straight to work with no supervision.
Safeway,1ea0sn4t2r67u800,4.0,"The work at Safeway is harder than one would expect in either a physical or mental sense. However, the people around you in the workplace make it much easier to get through the work day."
Safeway,1ea0f77vnqh1k800,3.0,"At the lowest end of the chain, no serious complaints. Was not to difficult, few tasks, sometimes great scheduling, pay was more than fair, and did not feel threatened in any way."
Safeway,1e9uiindv39o8000,5.0,A typical day at work went by pretty fast I am a sanitation lead so I cleaned carts I learned that you'll have nice and mean customers the management there was great everyone was very welcoming the hardest part about my job was having patience with cleaning carts the most enjoyable part of my job was seeing my coworkers.
Safeway,1e9ub98p4oc7b800,4.0,"I had some good times working at Safeway. I enjoyed a lot of the people I worked with too. There was at times some tension and difficulties but there are a decent amount of positives about working at Safeway. I thank the people that helped me but it wasn't the type of job for me, but still enjoyed working there sometimes."
Safeway,1e9u5j3neqm9j800,4.0,The diversity of the company and how they take care of the customers and the willingness to help the customers and the desire to help their employees to fill their obligations.
Safeway,1e9tb6dh4ov9i800,1.0,"This is most definitely not a career opportunity, the management sucks and it’s a serious lack of communication between management and employees especially in the bay point store 1215"
Safeway,1e9tahvnjqg1a803,3.0,"Safe environment, hard to maintain a good wellness when working difficult hours. No reliability in income. Not ideal for starting a family but definitely a good first job."
Safeway,1e9sfdut639o8000,5.0,Safeway is a wonderful place to work at.
Safeway,1e9qpqgbrol5n800,5.0,"Myself along with 70 other applicants worked as contractor's from May to December. We were hired right before Christmas. By the time Safeway was preparing to hire prospective employee's full-time, I have been acquainted with all individuals I would be working with."
Safeway,1e9pbe8ejqh0p800,3.0,I did not personally care for working as a barista but i di enjoy bagging however i was pregnant so pushing carts around was very difficult i liked the people working tere though very nice people
Safeway,1e9p3e3h8ol50800,2.0,"Safeway is a great starter job but its very physical and I personally feel like I don't belong there. They don't really give me weekends off and I would love to work everyday but I have things to do and appointments to get to, and having to ask for the day off is embarrassing for me, especially because it's my first job. They do try to work around your schedule but I feel like they get bothered because they have to look for someone to take over your shift. Overall I was liking Safeway for like the first week but now I come home tired of being in there an I'm only on my third week!"
Safeway,1e9jje5spoldm800,3.0,"Fairly good at most times but can be stressful. Not the greatest management. Some workers just don’t show up, and the others have to take over their roles while doing their own."
Safeway,1e9jd41kuolq5800,4.0,nice people and friendly coworkers. good manager and supervisor. no other reason. they have low price food. clean environment and nice customers and a lot of stock too
Safeway,1e9f3419voldb800,1.0,"As a first job, working the deli in a busy Safeway, it was one of the worst experiences of my life. I don't know how it is at other locations, but at mine it felt like I was nothing more than a drone in a consumerism fulled factory rather than a valued employee. Management was basically non-existent with training left to senior employees. And the long, grueling hours combined with a strict schedule, made for a rather miserable experience. There was even a point where another new hire and I were left to run the whole deli by ourselves for two hours with basically NO experience between us."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1e9e7v2aqolcn800,4.0,Hiring managers or human resources staff briefly review all applications looking for applicants who meet the minimum requirements outlined in the job posting. The goal of screening is to pare down the number of applications that receive a thorough review.
Safeway,1e9c3voc2prvp800,4.0,"The rewards club helps a lot of regular customers find their own products while saving good money on food and prices, while developing rewards on gas & etc."
Safeway,1e9bgjpmbqgv3802,1.0,"i worked for five months in Safeway Wheaton (Maryland) but I have never seen a company as racist as that one. harassment, lack of consideration, lie and many others on the part of managers. Until the day my child got sick and fired me. I warned Human Resources, but nothing. I recommend this company to no one because they are monsters who are there."
Safeway,1e9bdrc5pqfnn800,4.0,"Honestly, this wasn't the worst job I've had but it wasn't the best either. The managment wasn't the best, their dynamic was very off. To be able to get a day off or report an issue you had to go through about 4 or so people before getting to the right person. They definitely need to choose their managment better."
Safeway,1e9bblpdu32mm000,1.0,I got hired to be curbside shopper at 12.20. Then got told I could stock at night for 12.70. But wasn't told NOT the full eight hours. Only prime time from 12 to 5..Yeah. I walked out after 3 days.
Safeway,1e9bavnhuprvi800,1.0,Not Enough Real Time Training On Checkstands No Reliable Trainer To Show Or Explain The Do's & Don'ts On Checkstand Guidelines. Showed No Effort To Trainee On How To Deal With Customers Information About The Store & It's Inventory. Absolutely No Concern About The Well Being Of An Safeway Employee Safety Work Environment.
Safeway,1e99vuch7p00m800,1.0,They schedule you any and all holidays it is mandatory. The pay is horrible and when they offer you a position with a raise  the company does not follow through with the raise. Horrible benefits with no lifestyle scheduling.
Safeway,1e99komj6bmap800,5.0,"I honestly enjoyed this job it was really easy and fun to me the only bad thing is, is the customers some of them are really rude for no reason and you can't control them so you just have to deal with it."
Safeway,1e96uln83octq800,4.0,"Training was good, well paced; coworkers very flexible and helpful; fairly easy to get additional hours when desired,  learned lots of new things; I was taught the importance of safety and cleaning due to sharp knives and slicers; loved the chicken wings in various flavors"
Safeway,1e95el4oaol8r800,3.0,You’ll get scheduled for days on end without a day off people are really fun to work with and the job isn’t too difficult definitely not a bad place to work
Safeway,1e93hsii1p3vv800,1.0,"Starting from Corporate on down to store managers Safeway is just awful. They don't have any idea how to train people, so good luck on not sinking your first day. They treat their employees horribly. The pay scale is very very bad. Work hard for a year? Don't count on a raise. It is to bad but after Cerberus bought them it has just gone in the touket"
Safeway,1e91md20bnh9s800,5.0,Excellent safeway is a great investment  to work in and safe I really liked working in safeway the routine  schedule  we had made time go by quicklythats what I liked the most because I hate being  bored at work .
Safeway,1e8uhrmjuo15r800,2.0,Horrible environment they want everyone to constantly be scared to lose their jobs . There is no loyalty in the company just a bunch of backstabbers. Nothing is ever good enough they never give positive feedback on anything just negativity all the time
Safeway,1e8stsm40ovmv800,1.0,"This company is perfect if you like being treated poorly, overworked, guilted into working your days off or when sick, accused of theft, denied vacations, being bullied and harassed by department managers, with store directors turning a blind eye if one of their “Golden workers” happens to be one of those managers, having breaks taken away regularly, tricked into working a double shift and NOT receiving overtime pay for it with the excuse always being the employees fault for not clocking in or out, which leads me to, time clocking being altered for that reason or more commonly, so they can simply threaten a write up for being late, and, to top it all off, discriminated against racially and sexually. Now, many of you are thinking, “Safeway is a union job. Seems like something to take up with the union rep.” You are correct. Unfortunately, there are only a few reps and they can’t be everywhere, all the time, leaving many employees feeling ignored when serious issues arise."
Safeway,1e8sgcunff2kr800,5.0,Very awesome and nice people. Some thing could get better but that’s everywhere! Was treated fair as I did the same to others. Overall a great place to work!
Safeway,1e8q6bfdnotqm800,3.0,"depending on the location of the store would determine the amount of work and or stress you are taking on. as a courtesy clerk, whether it was pouring down rain or 100 degrees you are doing your job inside and out. you have to be able to handle rude people as well, be as nice and as welcoming as you can be, no excuses."
Safeway,1e8peb7fbq5f9800,1.0,"Personally I didn’t really like working here because the employees brought their problems to work I did learn how to handle money, cashier and it gave me more work experience."
Safeway,1e8o0nf4jp020800,3.0,Was a decent job it paid steady and had clear guidelines to keep me on track I did end up leaving due to a car accident and other aspects otherwise i might have stayed
Safeway,1e8lpa9v6p3r2800,3.0,"It's exactly what you would expect from a job at a grocery store. For the most part work is okay, but micromanagement can be a huge problem. Here's few things you might not know. You do not get first day sick pay and need a doctors note to get 2nd day sick pay. I've been there three years and have been unable to ever use any of my sick pay. Most of the managers are great, but some of the higher-up managers are terrible, especially if you're not one of the favorites."
Safeway,1e8kvobit32ln000,5.0,They have a seniority rules kind of thing but its good. They pay very well. Not only are they a customer first kind of job but they actually value the employees.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1e6h5bi88o1qe800,5.0,"The job was very interesting and very challenging but at the time it was a great position.  I was first a courtesy clerk, then promoted to E-Commerce.  I really enjoyed working that position, grocery shopping for customers"
Safeway,1e6fvh9h0qb6a800,4.0,really good management. great work environment. more tech help than other retail company and better pay too. Felt less stressful than other retail companies.
Safeway,1e6fec1jk4rhu800,1.0,Don’t do it  the manager constantly changed my schedule and called me in last minute cause she couldn’t set up schedules right  and we never had enough people working at any point
Safeway,1e6fa7s9boc66803,3.0,Management mostly supportive in store. Questionable support from upper management outside store level. I loved working in the floral department.  I would love another opportunity in floral design.
Safeway,1e6eo24bjo277800,5.0,Thaey are a great company they give you oppertunity they understand even the most oit of the ordinary situations family orientated . they are willing to help whrn things get rough and not afraid to understand were youve been and were your trying to go
Safeway,1e6cqvs94qe28800,1.0,"For me, Safeway wasn't very friendly towards me. The coworkers were very friendly, but management wasn't and fired me because they didn't think I was taking my job seriously, even though I was sick for a couple weeks"
Safeway,1e6a2m3vpoujm800,4.0,"Working at Safeway was Strict and rewarding at the same time. The manager at the time was fair. The job was simple, get the food, and put it in a cart."
Safeway,1e6879m8mqbq8802,3.0,"When I working in Safeway what I did was learn how to management my work time what I have to done when i work in Safeway. After I went home, I have to set up the next day what should i have to be done during the work."
Safeway,1e67cb7js31gl000,4.0,It was not a good place to work. It was a disaster to work with them. I was let go because I was going through difficulty with my co-workers. I'm not working there anymore.
Safeway,1e66s883n33ph000,4.0,I loved my job here my manager Charlotte was amazing and most of the people I worked with took me in like family. They offer great advancement and training.
Safeway,1e65fnhkvp3l1800,3.0,Employees are very hardworking and supportive. Most customers are easy to help and there's alot of cross-training between departments.
Safeway,1e655uema31gl000,3.0,"When i worked there, as a cashier, the manager there helps you out a lot with questions about ; what you can do for the customer and if needed, help checking because customers are waiting."
Safeway,1e62dtc50pq6n801,4.0,Good place to start working if you’re in school or are wanting to go. They work well with a school schedule and it’ll teach you a lot about the retail life.
Safeway,1e5vqi014oc6i802,5.0,"I love this job, everyday we give good customer service and keep the place clean to customer standards,  the bad thing is most everyone is always late"
Safeway,1e5uj90r8oc6i801,2.0,"This job is not exciting, engaging, or fun. I can't imagine doing this job for very long, much less as a career. After all, the grocery industry is known for its high turnover rate."
Safeway,1e5tsrq5epqru800,4.0,"Safeway's Starbucks kiosk runs similarly to a standalone Starbucks store, but often does not have the means and materials to operate in a comparable way. The store I worked at did not have an oven for pastries, blonde roast, or a cold brew tap. Sometimes, you have to deal with snippy customers expecting the full Starbucks glitz and glam and their upset or rude attitude when you let them know what they desire is unavailable. Management was very nice, and mostly flexible as long as they're given notice about schedule conflicts. Pay is not great, but fair for the job — plus you can usually keep what little tips you gather during the shift."
Safeway,1e5ti3vhcpqru800,3.0,They a great company to work for even if its your first job. Great learning experience to have. Great social skills as well and interacting with customers.
Safeway,1e5r7fqnuon0i800,1.0,Don't apply. Smokescreen. No management support because they are normally just sitting at the desk looking out the window overlooking the store and not helping with customer service when the lines are too long.
Safeway,1e5oqtgab39ff000,3.0,Decent company to work for when it comes to retail. Pay was increased based on previous retail experience. Standard retail job that had more respect then fred meyer
Safeway,1e5nrq63m39fd000,5.0,"I only left because I got cancer, I really loved this place so much everyone there was amazing, I wouldn't have left if I didn't have to. Managment was very caring and helped and worked around schedules if needed"

Safeway,1e4lpsh4v4ruf803,4.0,For the most part it’s a decent place to work. However when management is under pressure they tend to stress out the staff. Once you finally say “No” that you can no longer work all day or take responsibility for multiple departments you are valued less and their temperament changes towards you changes
Safeway,1e4kskjdson5m801,1.0,"No opportunities to move up unless you know someone from the top, only connected people get a chance to move up. I have more management background than most, still they overlook if they do not like you...."
Safeway,1e4ki4enbot8n803,1.0,Horrible place to work for . Management sucks  all they care about is the profit their making and nothing else. Once you have been there a certain amount of time they try anything to get rid of you
Safeway,1e4httn9gppbe804,4.0,"*The hardest part of the position is the manual work: lifting, bending, & moving products. It is what I liked as well because not just sitting around."
Safeway,1e4hqqsplo1rh803,4.0,"i,m sorry i really dont have much to say cuz this would be my first job so forgive me if this resume is a little messed up but i,m really trying to get this job so i can live my life and dreams"
Safeway,1e4f80qtappbe803,1.0,"I worked as a bakery clerk. The bakery was always understaffed forcing you to do the work of 2-3 people on top of customer service. The manager is.. Less than friendly. Often berates and belittles you. The way she treated people would often run off new recruits. I had to move something heavy and asked for help, and was told to just figure it out. So I tried to move it and ended up getting hurt. Long story short before I was cleared from the doctor they tried to force me to go back. I value my health, so I quit immediately. I do not recommend Safeway."
Safeway,1e4euu4q2on5e800,2.0,The places isn’t a bad place to work but i much rather work at Taco Bell then there . Everyone thinks there better when there higher up and don’t treat other people good . Sometimes not even customers.
Safeway,1e4erinc8on5e803,4.0,"8-5 basic job. No after hours on-call or weekends required. Challenges each day with various issues mixed into the normal software development, testing. Great co-workers and a fantastic boss who looked out for his people. (Too bad he retired last month)"
Safeway,1e4dn4inso1rh802,4.0,Being a cashier clerk at Safeway was fairly easy. But with the long shoes it went by fast being a cashier clerk because you seem groceries and put them in the bag all day it was a perfect job as a college student.
Safeway,1e4ck98cuppb7801,1.0,They don’t treat you like you are human. They will have you work crazy hard and not even say thank you or good job. All they care about is making money so they can bonus. They cut the stores hours back more and more and just pile more work on that staff that is there
Safeway,1e4ce16hkon4h803,4.0,"In my 7 years with the company i have been treated well. It is a repetitive job where you can learn many skills. Getting along with co workers is easy, it is good to have supportive co workers."
Safeway,1e4aoirvfqbpd803,5.0,"I had a lot of fun working there. I learned ways to improve my customer service and made some new friends. People there are very nice and helpful. The only hard part was having to get carts in the heat. A typical days work would be going to get carts for shoppers, putting the grocery customers did not want back and collecting baskets, going and getting items customers forgot or could not find and doing a lottle cleaning."
Safeway,1e46np2f6o1qd802,4.0,It wasn't a bad place to work and for the most part I thoroughly enjoyed it there.
Safeway,1e46m5e09ppae801,1.0,It was a good place to work until they cut hours and changed management all the time the staff was good to work with during my time with the company but other than that I will never work for them again
Safeway,1e437f24aq4um802,2.0,"Cool job bad manager a lot of hard work trucks in bad shape make you work in bad weather with no heat and bald tires unorganized and, more they also showed favoritism"
Safeway,1e42sii98q1tg803,3.0,"The work environment at Safe way if very friendly, everyone talks to everyone and is there for them when needed. All of my co workers make sure I am okay if I am having a bad day and do all they can to make me feel better"
Safeway,1e42q7g85q1tg802,3.0,"Focus on work, break rooms are rather dull, supervisors respect productivity and have employees earn their work hours by maintaining good attendance and having strong productivity"
Safeway,1e418odjjppa6803,5.0,Safeway is where I grew both as a person and with my career within the company. I Established  life long friendships with customers keeping many on first name based for many customers.  THEY ALWAYS MANAGED TO HANDLE ANY CHANGES WITH SCHEDULE IN TIMELY  MATTER
Safeway,1e3vl3vq939of001,5.0,Bagging groceries offering carryout cleaning restrooms then the five o'clock rush. Every customer has their preference and you have to deal with the public every day. You get your regular costumers every week for Friday sales. You'll see sometimes you are out of an item.
Safeway,1e3vf75pmotqs802,4.0,This was different than i have done. My co-workers were amazing. Management liked teaching me new things so i would able to advance in my career.  I learned how to manage all the booking skils. And my favorite was customer service. I made the best customers. Many times they just came in and sai Hi!
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1e3slmg2aou9h805,3.0,It was cool working their but the hours we’re getting cut. Not the best place if your looking for a first time retail experience. Enjoyed my time their.
Safeway,1e3pvu6vmnolb801,2.0,"Mico-management, no accountability for bad work, attendance, management new to position, poor communication with employees and supervisors. The company is relocating out of state."
Safeway,1e3oc0bvdobqr802,3.0,"There was definitely a standard at this establishment, but it was not in any way in favor of the employee. Safeway kept up a professional image but we were not able to express ourselves in any meaningful ways. No accessories, unnatural hair colors, and we could not wear business shirts."
Safeway,1e3ngvrjlobqr803,2.0,"If you want something to do this is it, but don't expect and appreciation for that work verbally or financially. Minimum wage starting then hopefully you can get an assistant management or maybe even a management position after 10+ years. They always are increasing the amount of work required and not giving you the people to help do that job. Got to a point that I couldn't take the mental harassment everyday of not getting a job done in the hours/employees given to accomplish that job."
Safeway,1e3ndsuou4opa802,5.0,"Great service , just wish i had more hours and more of the pay rate . But friendly coworkers and customers . I hate leaving them but just wanted more hours"
Safeway,1e3n4k5a4oat6801,3.0,"I left employment several years ago, but had a fairly positive experience.  The Director Pharmacy was outstanding, however the store general manager lowered my agreed hourly rate when I started and I had to repeatedly challenge him until I finally received the agreed upon wage.  This was years ago and he is no longer working for Safeway.  That was a bad initial representation of the company.  Thankfully my supervisor was outstanding and always delivered what he promised."
Safeway,1e3mrhtb6hcpn801,1.0,"This company is the most disrespectful,  and anti employee company I've ever worked for! They don't care about tenured employees,  and they are just a horrible company.  I have worked with them for several years, and in this time they have terminated me, twice and countless others just to have to bring us back via arbitration.  If you have time invested in the company and is at top pay, they want to get rid of you as opposed to applauding your loyalty and hard work. NEVER EVER WORK FOR THIS COMPANY."
Safeway,1e3mk8usaobqq801,1.0,In this company there is no support and the union is a joke.  You have to fight for yourself if there is a problem or to save your job.
Safeway,1e3lkpmleobdd803,5.0,As a pharmacy manager I worked 11 hour shifts but had additional days off.  This is a schedule that I preferred.  I had an excellent staff and for the most part sufficient ancillary help to do the job.  Front end Management was also extremely supportive of the pharmacy.   I loved helping people and sharing my knowledge.
Safeway,1e3l3l8f7obhh803,3.0,"There's no tough love or accountability from the top echelons of the Safeway Management Hierarchy to the Courtesy Clerks ( the lowest level positions) resulting in lackluster results and low work ethic. In fact there's not much communication at all from upper management to the rest of the staff. There needs to be constant communication and accountability to facilitate a strong and cohesive working environment. I love conversing with the shoppers. The most difficult part of the job is getting people to care about their jobs  and preforming as though they do, regardless of their pay rate. Any place you work you should treat that workplace as though you own it. In this way you will expect the most from yourself and perform to the best of your ability as will the other employees."
Safeway,1e3j0d3co38hb003,4.0,Going to work with alot of motivation learning alot of generals skills with very respectful management and energetic workplace noting hard about my job . enjoy working..
Safeway,1e3j08mv11cv5002,4.0,"On a daily basis, store is expected to be successfully stocked and faced in every department upon opening to meet customer satisfaction. Every department manager guides their colleagues to assure daily tasks are completed and their department is prepared. The work environment is not only welcoming and friendly amongst the customers but as well as with the employees."
Safeway,1e3gri774bllt803,2.0,"i started as a deli clerk. wanted the brass ring, went for deli manager to pay the rent, and thought i would  be good at it. I ended up with the same pay as my top deli clerk, with 300% more duties. Asked for compensation, or allow me to move down to just a clerk, and was denied, for several years.  Safeway never cared about Me."
Safeway,1e3g16e2jolfb800,3.0,I found that most of mangament had favoritism against certain employees. While you got great benefits and options in hours.. hours would drop for no reason because new employees would cycle through the company. It was over all easy work experience for my first job. Just not pleasant with other employees and especially mangament that later a few months after quitting- got fired.
Safeway,1e3fdogb0ocll803,5.0,I really enjoyed working at Safeway. Safeway is one of the few companies who still allow asset protection to do what needs to be done in order to stop merchandise from just walking out the doors. I really respect that because it shows me that the company cares about its merchandise and the people who are working hard to keep the shelves stocked for honest/paying customers.
Safeway,1e3fdht3g2v49000,3.0,Great people you work with.Management and pay are very average which leads to uninspired and unenergetic employees.Very hard to change the culture and overall quality in the departments.
Safeway,1e3fai3f8oclm802,2.0,"Great health benefits if you are in the union. If you are non-union, the health ""benefits"" are 1/3 of your wages, roughly. The people are generally nice to each other and to customers. Expect lies, corporate obstruction, keep a sharp eye on your paycheck by keeping a separate log book of your hours worked, and try not to be abused by being pulled in too many directions at once by management or fellow employees. You can make a career here and move into other departments if you so desire on occasion. Expect everyone to be playing on cellphones in the breakroom during their breaks."
Safeway,1e3ent8e2fdns803,2.0,The co-workers are nice but at the particular location I worked at the customers had a large sense of entitlement due to the fact that it was one of the more expensive grocery stores in the area. That made the job torture as the customers were rude and working in a grocery store is quite mundane as the tasks assigned for 2 hours were often done in fifteen minutes. This caused most of the shift time looking for things to do.
Safeway,1e3e7bc4ffdnr803,4.0,every day was always different and I got to meet a lot of great hard working people that I will always remember. I also learned a lot about how ro be friendly.
Safeway,1e3e0vg50fdns803,5.0,"A great place to work, great benefits and job growth. Management gives you the tools to be successful and plenty of opportunities to grow with the company. I wholeheartedly recommend working at Safeway."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1e3d6osdqbllt801,3.0,Good pay as a driver. Bad management in all departments. No loyalty with drivers. They have great tractors to drive and trailers. Must stay overnight on some trips.
Safeway,1e3c97saefdnr802,5.0,safeway is a good company to work with they gave you the hours your available to work aside from that there under UNION with benefits and all... the store i used to work was 24 hours
Safeway,1e38mg1j6olfb800,4.0,The schedule is always changing so I can not plan weeks ahead at a time without missing out on work. The job is rather annoying but has good benefits and such to it.
Safeway,1e36lv546q30v803,3.0,Working for Safeway is joyful. They treat you like family. I remember when I first started I knew nothing and then I turned around had one of the best trainers and became a pro at my job
Safeway,1e36eaj35bllt803,5.0,"Safeway has a wide variety of positions, both in their stores and in their supply chain. I worked nights in the frozen food department. Can't say I enjoyed the Muzak, but we were permitted to listen to our own music on headphones. Management focused much more on my results than on my methods, providing me with more latitude, in that respect, than I've been given at any other job."
Safeway,1e36900hmbllt803,5.0,Everyone works together to get jobs done.  The management works with you to give you the best possible schedule to fit your needs.  It's a very nice work environment.
Safeway,1e360m6t0q30v802,2.0,You get barely any help with this company. A thing called the sweep log holds you up a lot. They should give more breaks. They hire a lot of smokers. They are reluctant to change your position.
Safeway,1e35u12bmo97p803,5.0,"I enjoyed this place very much,  everyone became family. however i was very hurt emotionally  when i became sick and they were quick to give up on me."
Safeway,1e35lq5vtfdnr803,5.0,"I’ve worked at a lot of stores and at every store I learn something new, from operating procedures to merchandising."
Safeway,1e34cfhv8olfb803,4.0,Most of the managers are really nice . The other employees were nice to work with. The job  it self was really easy to pick up. They paid to train u and u can get over time in the paid training.
Safeway,1e330bidp48ht805,3.0,Working at safeway was only a positive experience due to my coworkers. They made the environment manageable. Wasn't very found of management. I only like my first boss when I was working there.
Safeway,1e32o7faehatl802,3.0,"I have not been a member of this team long enough to any viable feedback.  If the warehousing was planning to maintain operations in its current location there would be areas where efficiencies could be created to both better the work environment, work/life benefits, and save the company money."
Safeway,1e32d25f0obe8803,1.0,Wasn’t a good experience. I feel I waisted 10 years of my life. It is the union vs management and that is not a fun environment to be in. Everyday is a fight to keep your job and only the strong survive. Sounds crazy but it’s the truth!
Safeway,1e30hp6r8q5bm802,2.0,Hours are not that good but for a first job it’s a okay start but not a place to make a career they don’t really work so well with Scheduling so Cautious
Safeway,1e306s8jvq5bm803,3.0,"A typical day of work at the fuel station was a busy one. Many customers come in and out all day, and it is necessary to have excellent customer service to deal with customers. Fun co-workers made the job more appealing, but overall the job was very easy, but stressful dealing with so many people."
Safeway,1e2vdbtun32nd000,2.0,If your looking for a job that has kinda good pay and good benefits this may be for you. The management sucks but your in a union which can really help if anything happens. Raises happen every 6 months and they usually have good advancement opportunities
Safeway,1e2vab0o5obe8803,5.0,"While working at Safeway the work was very easy and fun at the same time ,I washed dishes and collected dishes from my station.The most enjoyable part of my job was getting too go on break and walk the golf courses that’s what I loved doing most!"
Safeway,1e2ukv32rngqd801,4.0,"Usually just normal work day show up, help customers, prepare the food cases for lunch service, management was pretty much non existent, hardest part of the job was cleaning the fryers and making sure everything was perfect for the next day, sometimes it could feel tedious but most of the time the job was pretty enjoyable when i was out on the floor stalking shelf's."
Safeway,1e2ug7aodhb1a803,4.0,"It is a very nice place to work. I love my co workers and I am able to get a ton of stuff done since I am a reliable worker. I also get paid quite fairly. The management could use a little work, but overall it is a quite enjoyable place to work. It has given me tons of experience in different areas of the company as well."
Safeway,1e2udaqhjq5gj803,2.0,"As a courtesy clerk, it is very exhausting and sometimes feels mindless. While time off requests were sometimes followed, often there were mistakes in schedules, and I personally was scheduled after my last day was supposed to be. But the management people were all very sweet and are trying their best to make the employees happy"
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1e2tnqd28hc36802,1.0,Was only hired to cover for someone who went to jail and after said person returned I was fired three days after they returned. I was not told that I was going to be a replacement for a short period of time. They over work you and are over all very rude! Be careful.
Safeway,1e2r3uq5sbm7p803,1.0,"Full of pr*cks, customers and employees alike.  Then you catch yourself slowly turning in to the pr*ck you hate, trying to appease the masses of a****les you're going to encounter.  You need this job, alright, don't work here unless you absolutely f****** have to.  They're going to milk you like a d*mn cow, except it's your life they're taking ."
Safeway,1e2pmkn31q5gj803,4.0,The job is really not as hard as the people who work there make it sound. But what Safeway's core values are about are somewhat corrupt and not what they make it out to be. They'll try and screw you over at any perfect opportunity.
Safeway,1e2nvsjrsocfk803,4.0,I would have love to stay there but i have to pay the bills the cost of living not is high for me to pay by myself. The people is nice there you can get alot of things done if i get a high paying job i will be bless
Safeway,1e2nmhst632n2003,3.0,What I have learned is the duties that needs to be done on your shift don’t depend on anyone because it won’t get done   Just do it yourself  and do not assume that the job was done always double check.
Safeway,1e2n5mra2bm7p801,1.0,The moral is disheartening to say the least: but I absolutely adore my grandson and because of him; I will do the right thing ; even if Safeway does not care.
Safeway,1e2mjgmuoq5bf803,1.0,This is not a good company to work for so many people besides myself that wanted to move up in the company at first I was on top with one manager in the company and then it was switched real quick when a new one came in I was pushed down to the bottom and had to work super hard again and again to try and get up again but never look at
Safeway,1e2mj762pq5bf802,4.0,"The work environment could be improved, most the equipment needs to be either fixed or replaced. Some of the other employees could stand to be questioned for"
Safeway,1e2md8scmo2n4802,1.0,"Many reviews for this company are positive.  These are all back office.  Working in a store is a horrible experience, even the union shop I worked in.  Bad wages, horrid corporporate policies.  Just don't."
Safeway,1e2ljctga25jd002,4.0,Enjoyed working here for the most part. I liked who I worked with and also liked the managers. I was a part time employee so my hours where fine with me.
Safeway,1e2ki0hlhq5gj801,1.0,the worst company to work for
Safeway,1e2kg2jkahc36802,3.0,This was an okay place to work. Some of the management plays favorites. Some things were good and a lot were bad. Sometimes just thrown into the job without any feed back.
Safeway,1e2kbb49448gq803,3.0,"if flexibility and convenience is what youre looking for, this is the job for you. its close by and most department managers will work with your schedule you interview with."
Safeway,1e2jm7gubf22n803,4.0,"This job helped me get on my feet when I moved , The culture was fun i work in three different stores and i had great relationships with all my co-workers,"
Safeway,1e2jltm7solrc803,4.0,My experience at Safeway has been overall a good one. I have worked at three different Safeways and it has only been at this last one that i am looking for a new job. I think that maybe the one i am currently at is just having some management problems.
Safeway,1e2jlioe2olrc803,3.0,I learned every position in the deli. Was topped out pay wise within 3 years. I really enjoyed my job there      the employees there are very nice and fun to work with
Safeway,1e2jh6bl525cd003,5.0,Fun working/interacting with different coworkers and learn who they are. Learning from who they are and how they lived life is an inspiration of who they are why they are. I like learning about different backgrounds because it helps you understand about diversity and what they faced in their lives.
Safeway,1e2je3ecsolrc802,5.0,Its a good job to know how things work around the store. I have learn what i need to know about  working with customers in any situation positive or negative.
Safeway,1e2j6v4o0f22n800,3.0,"The union protects you from being mistreated by management if you know your rights, so as long as you work hard and don't mess up over and over again you'll be fine."
Safeway,1e2isfr7nq5jp804,3.0,"I feel as though the workers are truly connected to the customers, addressing their needs and assisting in their daily shopping experience. However, the managers do not address the needs of the workers and listen to feedback or suggestions."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1e2i8ou1tq5jp805,3.0,"It is better or worse depending on the location, but usually the hours are flexible and the work isn't hard. The better the management, the more effectively the floor is run. Also, the people you work with are usually really nice!"
Safeway,1e2htcsu1olrc804,3.0,"It was always very stressful. The people there - co-workers and customers, were amazing. I loved coming to work because of the people I got to work with. We got through each day with each other. I did learn a lot of my customer service and problem resolution skills here.Scheduling wasn't very efficient and management wasn't always the best either. The hardest part was being short staffed so much. For the employees that did come in to work, more pressure was added to us."
Safeway,1e2hs5g9ao970803,4.0,This was my 1st time working under the union. That made it that much better. I worked as a cashier for 2 months then promoted. Training was very thorough.
Safeway,1e2hoeljvnord801,3.0,The Albertson's acquisition of the company changed the diversity and inclusion culture of Safeway. Also the customer focus has changed and employees don't seem to care as much as before.
Safeway,1e2hnhsjif22n802,5.0,"Great place to work, really friendly culture and are always supportive of there employees on top this they are super inclusive of all kinds of backgrounds"
Safeway,1e2hdd4i9olrc802,3.0,I like working there it was very clean organized and labor union help with job desputes I never failec because manager was always involved I got good experience
Safeway,1e2hbthovolrc802,1.0,No hours there are no hours at all you only get 23 maybe 25 hours per week no matter what managment is horrible even worse when it come to upper management visits and still again no hours available
Safeway,1e2hbnf5folrc803,3.0,"The work was busy, and its customer service so multitasking/prioritizing was important. Management was problematic at some points but Union helped with clearing everything up"
Safeway,1e2h9jtgmp43v802,4.0,"They have a computer lecture and test you must complete. It usually takes about 4-5 hours, but you get paid your normal wage for the hours spent on this assessment. You must keep calling them and be persistent with earning the job, they wont call you back to update you on the hiring process. The interview is fairly easy and simple, and afterwards you should keep calling to know your position. They will teach you anything you don’t already know from the computer assessment."
Safeway,1e2gvmhhsolrc802,1.0,This company is the bottom of the bottom for professionalism and management.  Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. I quit after 5 hours and I wrote a long letter to corporate regarding their appalling management.
Safeway,1e2gm1n8825cd002,1.0,"If you like to ask everyone all the time if they need an immunization, this job is for you.  Staffing hours are based on sales not how many scripts you do.  We have days where we do close to 300 scripts and our sales are low, and we have days where we do 150 scripts and our sales are sky high.  I believe, this is a recipe for disaster, when you do 300 scripts with just a pharmacist and 3 techs.  Also, you are salaried, and it is expected that you will stay late and work for free"
Safeway,1e2fc6e7sf22n802,5.0,I loved this job i loved talking to the customers some of them I knew by name. I would of stayed they would always cut the deli hours and give them to grocery for no apperent reason.
Safeway,1e2ef2q7hf22n802,5.0,"If you're willing to work hard and communicate your aspirations this company has no limits for the things you can achieve. They promote from within and so long as you maintain a positive attitude and strive to learn everything you can while you're there you can quickly move up and go into several different career avenues whether it is department management, store management or even backstage careers."
Safeway,1e2eeqhm4olrc803,4.0,"Nice place to work, friendly customers. If you give a smile, get a smile back. Company is good. Just don't like how we don't have that much help in  the front end."
Safeway,1e2e43m0iq5jp803,1.0,"I was happy that I got an opportunity to work there but once the manager met me she was rude, disrespectful, and not helpful at all. I warn anyone if you want a job in bakery get ready to be treated awful by all the employees it's not a good place to work and the main manager sticks up for this person's behavior .Awful place to work for."
Safeway,1e2d9jh1kq5jp802,2.0,"It's ok, not horrible. If you were a employee that wanted to move up and achieve this is not the place for you. But you are young and need some spending money then it's a good job."
Safeway,1e2cbvu3pq5e6802,4.0,It's a grocery store so everyone's like family.  Great management and coworkers.  Safeway is a very enjoyable and family oriented place to work.  Work can sometimes be overwhelming on holidays but staff is always there to back you up.
Safeway,1e2bjubrs4rij802,5.0,Safeway was very family friendly. I enjoyed building a rapport wit a lot of the returning customers. The employees/management were also very pleasant to work with there.
Safeway,1e2b6pa1rq51i801,1.0,"Do not recommend working this location.  Horrible management, benefits are a joke, pay is low even with prior experience. Customer service is out the door and the manager has a criminal record in California."
Safeway,1e2aqogm0o8tt803,4.0,There are a multitude of departments to work for. Certain departments have excellent pay. Only draw back is depending on the state you live in the mandatory joining of the union is a little irritating but has its benefits as well.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1e2adll00bln8802,5.0,"Overall, the majority of the time I had a good time working for Safeway. They were very lenient, and the management kept a smile on their face. Although, it can become difficult being a new worker because you get the more busy days the more experienced employees would avoid."
Safeway,1e2a05rjibln8802,3.0,Hard workers are not appreciated.  The wage is very low and one must belong to the Union and pay monthly dues. Scheduling occurs weekly and not always does one receive the minimum of 24 hours of work to maintain insurance coverage.
Safeway,1e29vatq8bln8800,1.0,Slave way is another word to work Safeway.  The hours suck. They treat just like slaves.  The managers won't let you transfer to a different department.
Safeway,1e26r65l7hajo802,4.0,"When I first started as a barista, the hours were very flexible and everything was mostly about the customer. As a manager, my work seemed to take precedence (which I did expect in a way), but it felt that work was supposed to be my whole life. The most enjoyable part of the job though is the people (customers and who you work with). It makes the job a lot more fun."
Safeway,1e269a9utp434803,5.0,its great cant speak for other.i which it did change managment it would have been last place i would have work.They also help you with personal problem you had your life to .
Safeway,1e25u0vk3q5e6802,5.0,I really enjoyed working for Safeway great benefits and you can move up if you work hard they always mad sure I felt comfortable and let me kno that I was appreciated...would definitely work for them again.
Safeway,1e24evfqbq5e6801,1.0,"It would be better if they gave hours to the people that need them and give college kids all the part time positions they can work, and give people with physical disabilities positions they can physically handle."
Safeway,1e24dafik4rij802,3.0,"Safeway is in negotiations with the their union and company right now. If they cared about their employees Safeway would give them what they want: better pay, benefits, etc."
Safeway,1e24667890j29003,1.0,"Myself love working at safeway ,help the custom bag the grocery for the custom in the store.putting item on  the shelve in the store.help the edely person in the store with the grorcery."
Safeway,1e243nabfq5e6801,5.0,Follow the rules of being a nice person. Safeway is like a family. Amazing people. Loved the job. Lovedthe people. It's sometimes hard work depending on your department. Be on time. Be friends with your union rep. He's a great guy.... And you'll work there forever if that's your goal.
Safeway,1e243b9pno8tt802,1.0,Would not recommend working for them unless you want to not have a family or never see you family. Good for workaholic people. Never considered other people only themselves.
Safeway,1e241at3qf0me803,1.0,They are only concerned about making money. Try to get the most work out of you without having to actually pay you the wages for the jobs you re doing.
Safeway,1e240m8lchcsv802,1.0,they take advantage of the employes and no way to advance in the company. the company doesn't have any good qualities and needs to have a major restructure so that employees actually get some type of benefits.
Safeway,1e23cpbe6othd805,3.0,It’s a good company to work for. I’m not getting paid as much and we don’t get overtime. The upper management are good people and they put us in a good position to succeed
Safeway,1e22l1sjqf0me803,2.0,"When I had started, everything seemed fine. The people are usually a lot of fun to work with, however within a couple months the cracks are showing. Disrespectful managers, lazy courtesy clerks, and a few of the higher ups don't care about you at all. The pay is not worth the effort they expect out of you."
Safeway,1e225o2rvbm8r804,5.0,I worked as a stocker and cashier. I'm very friendly so Cashier was what i liked to do. not many hours to go around but gives you flexiblity to maybe work another job.
Safeway,1e21t5gfvbm8r800,2.0,"For the 4 years that I have worked under Safeway, my store has changed directors 11 times. That's a average of 3-4 months per store director before they quit or are fired. It should be no surprise that as a result the chain of command is completely unintelligible, often resulting in conflicting commands and denial of prior confirmed requests."
Safeway,1e21gvfpcbm8r802,1.0,Did not enjoy this job. Not very organized and customers and staff is rude. Management could care less about employees and Union is no help yet you pay so much for it.
Safeway,1e21917fcolq3803,1.0,Many issues with False accusations. Not taking the right taxes out. Threatening D.M. false promises from all upper management.
Safeway,1e20j7oujbm8r803,5.0,This is the kind of job you want if you’re interested in climbing up in a company. I got my chance and it went great. Would have stayed if I had not been given a better opportunity elsewhere. But great experience with this company. Highly recommend.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1e209gkriolq3803,5.0,Learned interacting and working with customers and clients and co workers that taught me how to appreciate people that came to the store daily. Most enjoyable and hardest parts of the job. Busy job with a lot of standing and walking and carrying/picking up. Cleaned the spilt stuff and put caution etc.
Safeway,1e1vs3k4mbm8r803,1.0,"My hard work never paid off, terrible management, no discounts, and overall they guaranteed me holiday pay and overtime but never revived either within the time I was employed."
Safeway,1e1vnuc1vf0a5803,4.0,Commit yourself too excellence and thrive too set a goal and hit the targets and stay positive and share and mentor your experience for the next ones that are looking too succeed.
Safeway,1e1vhbkvq25ia002,5.0,welling to work good worker  love4 to work very hard realieable very hard worker please help good a good job please please help good worker honest worker hard
Safeway,1e1vf482mq59h802,3.0,"Management  is very understanding. Wonderful coworkers, but can tend to be a lot of drama. It tended to be very fast paced and hard labor at times. Hardest part of the job was standing my ground and refusing to be overworked, but I genuinely enjoyed my day to day work."
Safeway,1e1vao5vgolq3803,2.0,"They are mostly focused on making money (hard to do with no hard working people) and will drive you into the ground if you’re not careful. They won’t try to help you out if you aren’t deathly ill, only good thing is the union"
Safeway,1e1v8mtahbm8r802,5.0,this Safeway location maintained a professional atmosphere with a comfortable environment that ensured peak performance for myself and other employees.
Safeway,1e1v6nqkso8tc801,2.0,"It was  an okay place to work. The job was okay, if I had to go back again I would if I had too.   It was an typical day of work at Safeway.  This job was very demanding."
Safeway,1e1upci47o8t9801,5.0,definitely a place to where you can grow and gain better job opportunites. there are tons of people here to help you improve your knowledge on basic life skills.
Safeway,1e1tjosk2316p002,5.0,Coming into work was a great feeling to assist customers  in their everyday shopping. When I was working for the deli department we worked at a fast pace to get customers in and out which was great service on our end.
Safeway,1e1tdgnjdbm8r802,3.0,"I loved it, then I hated it and the culture. Overall its ok. I loved some of my co workers other I tolerated because I had to. Again I hated this job but i liked it because of my co workers."
Safeway,1e1spjtklhbgo800,5.0,Working for Safeway we were never slow and always got all the tasks we were given done in a timely manner even when the store was packed. Customers and employees always left happy and satisfied.
Safeway,1e1sclsnohd6k802,5.0,Had to leave because it was impossible to get to work after I had to move I wish that I could still work for the company but I belive that time has past I do not blame them it is a great company to work for
Safeway,1e1rspv6nbm8r803,4.0,Safeway has many different opportunities no matter who you are and I think that is very important in a workplace. There are rarely any times you would walk into a Safeway and there is one person not working hard.
Safeway,1e1qeve2vhctm803,4.0,"At work I usually get along with my fellow employees. responsibilities include Cleaning regularly, Handling money. Assisting customers find items in the store. etc. the hardest part of the job is just the rude customers."
Safeway,1e1pi0qb1q59h801,5.0,"While working for Safeway i had many opportunities to improve my work skills and i enjoyed my time there, just had hoped they would have more flexibility on hours"
Safeway,1e1p3rrasbm8r803,4.0,Safeway is a decent place to work. Base pay unless you decide you want to move up further into management. Personable people and job. Constant learning and review of how to improve.
Safeway,1e1ljvu9po2j8802,3.0,"On your feet job, physically demanding and a continuously busy schedule! Big team of workers you were always being introduced, good job for someone who works better on a busier schedule, likes to be physically active for long periods of time, and works well in customer service."
Safeway,1e1lbufitf0a5802,1.0,"its a productive work place but the management is terrible. I was getting yelled at by management for doing something they told me to do, exactly as they told me to do it."
Safeway,1e1l9ltg9q59h803,5.0,"I worked at Safeway from 2018-2020 as a Jamba Juice Clerk. It was pretty good overall. We got free smoothies on the shift, management was not breathing down my neck, and I knew my job inside out because I used to work at a stand alone Jamba. However, this Jamba Juice is now more Safeway-oriented because we never  meaning we no longer accepted any sort of Jamba gift card/promotional item. Also, the Jamba shirt I wore was from about 3 years back because we couldn't order anymore. The training was terrible as well especially for new employees who didn't know how to work in a Jamba because all it was was just one day of online videos that were more Safeway related and one day of floor training. We worked alone and the hours online never matched with the hours of the store."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1e1ks2vi5bm8r803,4.0,"The hours you get are very manageable, the company has a lot of employee benefits, and pays minimum wage. The people who work there are very helpful and nice, so overall its a great company to work for."
Safeway,1e1kekubfouer803,3.0,"at first the job was really good but its hard to work with management that dont really care about there employers. some did but the few that didnt that i worked with reguarly made my job very diffivult, and i know that no job will be easy, but when one thing is said to your face and another thing different behind your back, its hard to stay in that type of enviorment. I learned that i like going above and beyond even if no one is watching, and somewhere or sometime it will pay off, just didn't seem to at Safeway. The hardest part was being around such a dramatic environment, no one would tell me if i did something wrong even if i never got complaints from customers. so it was hard for me to figure out what was going on."
Safeway,1e1itqffiq59h803,5.0,There are those that put in the extra effort to get the job done and you can be cross trained to assist in other departments... with that being said the opportunity to get the hours you need and the opportunity to get the pay you deserve. I was already being offered Assistant manager of my department within 2 months...they need dedicated people....great union to work for
Safeway,1e1iopb1solq3803,3.0,The training wasn't job specific it was more general training than anything. Management's instructions were hard to interpret. The job environment was toxic and full of drama
Safeway,1e1i8k937hc27802,3.0,"A typical day at Safeway was stressful and included passive-aggressive management from one of the clerk managers or from the store manager himself. Pushing carts in the summer and winter was painful and difficult and if the management doesn't like you, you will often be out there days in a row."
Safeway,1e1i5ccgjhbgo803,4.0,"I left a job to go to this one. It had better and hours. A medical forced me to leave. Would have been a good start to build after a very recent move. If my recovery goes as planned, I will reapply when I return to work."

Safeway,1e1gh3eb7bm8r802,3.0,We work really hard and hours change daily. No raises and they dont care about our suggestions or complaints. Pay 50 dollars a month to a useless union run by chickenshit people who are apparently afraid on the corporation.  They just want a body their to make them money and we get our hours cut to fulfill their bonuses.
Safeway,1e1fsg1tv25ia002,5.0,"Very good & flexible place to work , I learned great customer skills & retails skills , I enjoyed  helping people & helping the store run smoother on a daily basis"

Safeway,1e1f6s56khd6k803,3.0,As a cashier I would stand for long periods of time with only one 15 minute break in my 8 hour shifts. I learned a lot mostly from the costumers that came in. Management was ok. culture was terrible. hardest part was standing for long periods of time.
Safeway,1e1e92q62f0a5803,5.0,You put into your job at Safeway you get a larger return!! I’ve learned a lot of customers are not typically the same except most want to be respected and are honestly treated well. Management wants you committed to your hours and to honor those commitments. Workplace culture is relaxed and very easy going; it seems the location I work at employees are friendly and considerate of each seemingly like a adaptive family. The hardest part of the job I think is doing that me and staying focused on that task. And the most rewarding part of the job is at the end of the day you’ve accepted in making one customer satisfaction in receiving a in their experience and collaboration in helping others as well as yourself succeed in professional customer service and a prptoduvccy s they customers can enjoy...

Safeway,1e0u5545l31hi003,4.0,"While I have zero problems with my time in Safeway, as they are a good company with good pay, the customers truly make me want to hurt people. But I guess that's to be said for any retail job."

She appreciated having me there and was a very likable woman who made sure that I was handling the workload both properly and without issue.  The store managers were very similar in their treatment of me, as they were all nothing like the stories you hear from most retail workers.  They genuinely care for their workers and will force people to take a break if they feel that it is necessary for their well-being, regardless of the amount of work that may still need to be done."

Safeway,1e0j1u5rcblr6803,2.0,"It's nice to have a union. The pay was pretty good. It's a lot of hard work. When I was there we worked a lot of overtime because we were so understaffed  and were working six days a week. Once, I worked 13 days straight."
Safeway,1e0i32t6nol2h803,3.0,most enjoyable part of the job was making someone who was feeling bad or had been sick laugh and know that I cared about how they were feeling that particular day.  Another was having people know who you were after only talking to them on the phone but making that kind of impression on them and having them come in to pick up their prescription smiling and going about you and the call they had earlier with you.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.

Safeway,1e0gd7glnol2h802,4.0,"It takes forever to get raises here and the pay makes it unlivable it California. My co-workers are great but, the pay makes the job depressing sometimes."
Safeway,1e0g57mqrh6ls802,5.0,It is a great workplace but in that area customers always disrespect any employees for no reason and we have to accept it afterward can't respond unless if the manger there then I have direct to the manger.
Safeway,1e0cub1tfblr6801,3.0,Management only cares for themselves and what the corporate office tells them to do. It’s like a power struggle for the lower class workers stuck in the retail world. Decent pay and decent benefits though. You just need to deal with a lot of b.s. from co workers management and customers. Goodluck if your seeking employment from the company. Decent stores may vary imo.
Safeway,1e0cf2oul4shu803,1.0,"This is a job for those straight out of high school who still live with their parents.  Understand that management does not care if you’re sick, if you’ve had a death in"
Safeway,1e0cc2q8oo9mp801,1.0,Customer Service is a pleasure to serve the customers and employees and management are wonderful to work with. Superior Service  was actually to serve the customers and please in the  customer to the fullest.
Safeway,1e0bun4vkq5ia804,3.0,"picking orders here means talking into a head set that tells you what to pick and stack on a pallet all day. pallets get stacked taller than you and are very easy to tip when driving on electric pallet jack. basically don't talk to anyone all day and breaks are at a set time and end at a set time so if you aren't out working the second break ens it eats into you order picking time and gives you bad percentage at the end of the day, same with going to the bathroom."

The management and staff of the whole store is almost unmatched with friendliness, great customer service, and a happy attitude. I will miss working here because safeway offers their employees 5-10% off of your purchase with you club card, they are recognized by the union, and they offer competitive pay  in conclusion, working for safeway was amazing"
Safeway,1e09lssulobp4801,5.0,"It was about what you would expect from working at a safeway. I clocked in, went to my station as a clerk, and checked customers out while talking to them and bagging their groceries."
Safeway,1e0981meo307m001,5.0,I love the job. The people I work with including management are great. The hardest part of the job is scanning groceries fast during busy times. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting customers and helping them. I wish the pay would be increased by about 5-6 dollars per hour.
Safeway,1e093ka66obp4802,5.0,the staff are really helpful and always wanting to make sure you needed what you needed. always mindful of wanting to make you exit the store happily and fulfilled.
Safeway,1e08pb84b307m002,2.0,"Pay is good but if you are in the role I was as the sole tech in a remote zone, you always have to be available for the job. No guaranteed days off unless on Paid Time Off. This also led me into performing the deployment of new equipment at night while maintaining the equipment during the day time, so that they didn't have to spend the money to get a deployment tech into a remote location. They will not accommodate you due to the nature of the business."
Safeway,1e0825oopbja3802,1.0,"I came highly recommended with previous management skills & I received no respect for any of that but instead treated like a piece of S#%! On the ground by not only management but the high school drama queens who constantly lied & missed work then stole others shifts to make up for the shifts they missed! Do yourself a SOLID & run, run the other direction away from Rivermark Safeway/Starbucks because once your caught up in the web of horrid people it’s almost impossible  to get away from them."
Safeway,1e078gkg5obvt803,4.0,"I didn't realize how great I had it at Safeway. My manager and co-workers were some of the best people I've ever known, not only at work. Out of all the Pharmacy Tech jobs I have had Safeway is in the top 2."
Safeway,1e073p2embja3802,4.0,Being a courtesy clerk was fairly pleasant and can be beneficial to yourself due to being around people and having to engage in helping and talking to anyone in the store. If you are good with people and aren’t shy to help anyone then this a great job.
Safeway,1e0719iliobp3800,1.0,You get a different days to work and random hours which overall are not enough.every week it’s a different schedule some weeks you only get 16 hours and some weeks a little more . If you want to stay in one place and work yourself up it’s going to take years for 40 hours a week and full benefits. Co worker’s are nice but management is not .
Safeway,1e06td6ci307n002,5.0,"Enjoyed working with people, but it is a corporation and so the more you do the more is expected of you -"
Safeway,1e06t6398obvt800,2.0,"Started off well, after a few weeks employees never really tried to connect with each other. very distant from new people. i feel like that is the reason people find it hard to stay. worked me 39 hours a week and would not give me any more so I cant get full time benefits."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1e06dbd04obp4803,2.0,"Safeway was, once upon a time, a cool place to work with a strong union. Then albertsons bought them out and it all went south. Terrible management, inconsistent job duties, minimum wage pay for a mountain of constant work, and a general lack of consideration for upward mobility."
Safeway,1e06b51sqbja3803,1.0,When I first started working for Safeway in 1996 it was a great place to work. But nowadays the management is horrible and demeaning. I felt harassed on a daily basis. I would not recommend this job to anybody. The benefits are sorely lacking as well. Pay is good though. Union not great either
Safeway,1e0617iomobvt802,3.0,Flexibility in hours
Safeway,1e05un3e2bja3802,1.0,"Every job has difficulties but when the employer reduces labor to improve the bottom line because of poor decision making from the executice staff, difficulties are magnified and employee morale falls."
Safeway,1e05r4ljjbja3802,4.0,"I have seen that in grocery stores, the people who are usually happy with their jobs are the cashiers, customer service and Starbucks.  There are other departments to work in too, but beware the deli! Once you're in you'll never get out!"
Safeway,1e05qk6tnbja3802,5.0,"I know that Safeway is an awesome place to work at, and that they are good at taking to their employees, and giving them great feedback about their work. Safeway has given me a chance to know what work ethic really is, and that everyone there is all there to help and to watch over another. Safeway also is understanding and never has given me any problems or had miscommunication with me."
Safeway,1e04udn8qhcip802,3.0,"Work/life balance only rates so high because my department (fuel) was very small, so lack of seniority didn't hurt my hours too much.  The low pay, however, made the lack of full hours rather painful to living.  Union contract said that one would have to work a minimum of four consecutive weeks at full hours, without someone being on medical leave or vacation to facilitate that, in order to get full-time work.  They NEVER allowed that to happen.  Their health plan was a token gesture, only getting really good if you stayed with the company for a long time.  Didn't bother with it, as it didn't cover a couple of areas (dental and mental health care) that are more crucial for me than anything.  Job security was solid, thanks to the labor union.  Say what you will about unions, but they do make it hard to be fired without a seriously good reason.  Unfortunately, this also made it near impossible to get rid of employees who were grossly incompetent that everyone hated.  And hours are only effected by seniority, not by ability, which meant a superstar employee would always lose hours to an older, unintelligent, unpleasant, absolutely awful worker who was only still there because she knew how to pull the labor union's strings.  How good the managers were came down to the individual in the end, with my department manager being pretty chill and good at his job.  At the same time, we had a bakery manager who seemed stoned most of the time and often mixed up price tags.  Job culture has two sides: co-workers and customers.  The kindest description I can give of typical retail customers"
Safeway,1e04lgvt5hdbq806,5.0,It was a good job for a teenager and I loved my coworkers. Schedule was always released late but they were very flexible about last minute adjustments

Safeway,1e01aocdvosop802,3.0,The job was something thatbwa not meant for me. I had a lot of things to do at that job. The hours was not flexible when I wasn't playing sports. It's hard to get different hours.
Safeway,1e00i2v2qhbii803,3.0,it just needs more good managers that can and will support their employees in any situation ..they also need give their emplyees a better pay for the hour they work.

Safeway,1dvubsbbchbii802,5.0,Safeway was the most amazing job that I've ever had the pleasure to work at. There was so much room to grow from being a customer service rep to a business analyst.
Safeway,1dvu6p6rihdbq802,4.0,"I was happy to work part-time and learn about the role of community retail pharmacy. I would have stuck it out longer had the pay been fair. I started pay well below what should have been expected for someone responsible for other's medical conditions. Had I been able to, I would have continued to work there as a student of pharmacy because the hours were so short. I just couldn't sustain myself as a person with such little pay. I was there for quite some time and the store could not offer any technician a full-time position due to the pharmacy not being allowed the labor hours."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.

Safeway,1dvsg3m16bmlf802,4.0,"This was a good first job. I excelled quickly here, however management was hesitant to move me ahead in terms of salary. I stayed in an underpaid position, completing the work of other positions."
Safeway,1dvs50rtrosop803,5.0,"Great people to work around. I enjoyed helping out the customers, whether it was helping them look for certain items, bagging their groceries, or helping out to their car with their groceries."
Safeway,1dvs3l0phbmlg802,2.0,I enjoyed the environment. Worked in produce and cashier.
Safeway,1dvrnbic9blms802,5.0,This to go with working hours and everyone there is very nice and provides amazing hospitality. Always make sure to be on time as it will effect the whole crew
Safeway,1dvq7bujdbmlg803,3.0,"Safeway is a good place to work, many of my coworkers worked there for a long time and seemed to be happy. I just think if you arent wanting to do the same thing every day, they have other departments for you go go to."
Safeway,1dvo1vehaosop803,3.0,I recommend Safeway in a way because it does come with a lot of benefits but also if I dint have much experience they’ll start u at minimum wage but u can always ask for a raise so it’s worthy.
Safeway,1dvnm4dblo1hc803,5.0,For a grocery chain this place was great to work for. I liked the management. My training was great and the customers friendly. We were located next to a river so we were busy all the time.
Safeway,1dvna0g9t4rv6802,1.0,Does not value workers as people. Consistently does not hold other employees accountable and makes other employees fill in at a moments notice. Disrespectful to workers in general.
Safeway,1dvn6cou5nh7m809,4.0,"It was a cashier job. You went in, scanned things, and left. At the Kirkland location, management is responsive and coworkers are good. Would recommend. However, you need to be firm with your availability and may need to restate it once or twice."
Safeway,1dvn1fn1qo1hd803,4.0,"One of the best things about working at Safeway, was that, though you did need to meet certain expectations, the management, as well as coworkers, were very good at forgiving and correcting mistakes. Friends were easily made with the management and other workers, and the team spirit made it a fun job. One of the hardest parts of the job was during the holidays; at about a week before any holiday, the business doubled, sometimes tripled. Getting more work done with the same amount of time was definitely a challenge, but helped me work at a faster pace."
Safeway,1dvmmcl9aou8q802,4.0,I received merchandise as it came in every night.  Restocked shelves in the aisles. Assist cashiers with products and Bagging when short staffed. The hardest part of the job  to me was not being able to finish up all the work in such short time spann
Safeway,1dvm9lsfrhbf3802,4.0,i enjoyed this job it had a higher pay than most because of the location it stayed very busy and i enjoyed that i enjoy working with other people in the work
Safeway,1dvl8ppd1nrfd804,3.0,While working at Safeway I was not too happy but I did have consistent hours. The schedule was not that flexible witch is makes it hard to valence work and school for a long time
Safeway,1dvkg0dk2nrfd803,1.0,i just went in and got the job done not a whole lot of talking. didn't really learn anything and there was no training. management was bad with no one even there if you work night just you and your coworkers.
Safeway,1dvkcq54qblvk802,4.0,"Clock in on time, not early or late. required to take a lunch and breaks depending on hours worked on shift required by the union. learned that safeway is all about safety and fast pace. If your not fast detail oriented and safetey. these words are key during interview, safety first, customer service, fast and quick learner. hardest part is there is no actual life time. the hours fluctuate but your coworkers are mostly always fun especially the ones who have been there for years. management and culture depend on the store. sfaeway moves management around wquite a bit. so just when you think your used to a manager and you know his expected stardards they change the managment on you. when you first start you must sign up for the union. they will take initiation fees out slowly from your check so its not too traumatizing. just in case you get upset and not sure what the union is actually for they are like your lawyer. if you get accused of something or fired for any reason you call them.  they protect your rights forom getting screwed over. safeway has paid my bills for years but will screw you over if there was no union. i have been loyal to them for the last 7 years and as long as you work, dont call in unless your actually sick, and do what your supposed to do with a masmile youll be okay."
Safeway,1dvk473mrnh7m801,3.0,The location that I worked at had hired too many people for the opening so a lot of the people including myself got our hours cut down to almost nothing.
Safeway,1dvjsrpg3olf2802,1.0,"The whole industry was toxic and very discriminatory towards my background and religion. My former manager pushed me over limits which would be considered borderline illegal and attempted to fire me at any given moment, hence putting in my own two weeks."
Safeway,1dvjouf8ko1hd802,1.0,"They will lie to you about raises, benefits ect. They will give you a certain time limit on tasks that are physically impossible to complete. They’ll always expect you to stay later and don’t care if you have appointments to take care of. If I could give this review zero stars I would have."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dvjj9vgrou8q803,2.0,"I.m not a huge fan of our management it feels like they care more about how the store makes them look then how the store looks or how the employees feel about working for them, they tend to discourage new ideas or personal thinking"
Safeway,1dvif3q1goapt803,3.0,"good company to work for. friendly staff and great customers. flexible work schedules. they closed all the stores in florida though, because publix bought them out."
Safeway,1dvi8tsc7obri803,2.0,Hard work and under-appreciated. Lack of a good training program. High expectations with little support. Grateful for the competitive wage and good benefits. Also thankful for my pension.
Safeway,1dvh5ikt9o1uj800,4.0,"If you are planning on applying you should avoid the Bakery at all cost, the work day starts absurdly early (3am) and ends  around 1-2pm however the amount of work you do is quite a lot especially if you have little help. It's very enjoyable if you and your coworker get along but it pretty tedious alone."
Safeway,1dvgf3vi832l0002,3.0,I could not make a living off safeway! The work conditions and all the qork you have to do is not worth the compensation. Honestly I was drained with poor pay! The manager was great and the people I worked with was great! Safeway really needs to up their minimum wage because it is unrealistic for someone to make their billsof theat wage!
Safeway,1dvg1jrqlh6vo803,2.0,"Safeway was my first full-time job. At the time, I didn't have very many expenses, but I was intending to save up for my own apartment and car, in hopes of achieving a higher level of independence. Typically, you would start as a cart pusher and work your way up to cashier and so on, but my prior part-time experience as a cashier guaranteed me a job as such. The job itself was great at first, but the doldrums of monotony soon made it wear out its welcome."
Safeway,1dvef4469f0pf801,4.0,"Was team friendly, nice place to work."
Safeway,1dvd4jni7ou2a802,2.0,When I was working there the staff seemed to form cliques. There wasnt really any teamwork. Very much so fending for yourself.Managemeny didnt seem to care about the schedules even when there were errors.
Safeway,1dvcusl7m4sha802,1.0,This company has absolutely no regard for family and work life balance.  They have very limited help and expect the world from their employees.
Safeway,1dvcq5jsiobri800,4.0,Loyal to there employees. They promoted within the house. Management always help out when busy. Always family orientated.. always receive praise when doing a good job.
Safeway,1dvaq12iub68v801,1.0,"Im sure it has changed since i worked there but when i was there they defiantly didn't make it feel like its an work environment that being a ""team player"" matters imagine being a bookkeeper moved to the deli dpt because a paperclip or rubber band on the floor made the office as a whole dirty and it could be no one other then you who made those God awful mistakes. this one defiantly had they're favorites and no matter how hard you worked it wouldn't amount to anything? if you weren't liked you were fired for the smallest reasons period."
Safeway,1dvaig3tpb68v800,4.0,"I learned the skills to work in face paced customer service, how to follow proper cleaning and cooking instructions, how to operate the p.o.s system. Management was great"
Safeway,1dvai0apuf0pf803,1.0,"I get that in the company of Safeway I've done some things that they may have not liked, but they pull strings and make my work experience there miserable, i felt harassed and unappreciated for everything i did i tried but guess it wasn't good enough so i felt unwanted and unhappy being there."
Safeway,1dvah9rorf0pf805,3.0,Leader ship culture ethics morals principles is out of proportion and people need to learn what it’s like back in the 1970s.  Back in the day never used to be like this generation is not the same When I was growing up. Better work ethic back in my day
Safeway,1dv9ik2ubf23m801,3.0,"A typical day at work involves unloading grocery pallets that are brought in either before or after you clock in. On bad days these can range to several hours late, which usually means its impossible to complete your task. When breaking the load you spot, stock, and face the aisles with grocery product, which is the main part of the job. If you enjoy consistent tasks everyday, this aspect is true for Night Crew, however there are complications."
Safeway,1dv8nt72sf0pf800,1.0,"This was the worst job I’ve ever had. Management didn’t care about employees whatsoever, my time spent at work wasn’t respected, the manager tried to worm her way into my personal life, and she would throw objects at our heads."
Safeway,1dv7jrbe9ou2a803,3.0,"It is hard to say, because I worked for several different managers. But for the most part, it was a secure union job. I did get paid quite well. The security was not good at all"
Safeway,1dv7jhqqmf23m803,5.0,"Management was excellent Workplace culture was warm, welcoming"
Safeway,1dv7a105goapt804,5.0,"There were no problems, everyone helped me figure out how to do my position and was very kind to help me. Also, I was able to get along with everyone."
Safeway,1dv77aoljqflo803,2.0,I didn’t enjoy working at safeway at all. I only enjoyed some of the people that worked there. The hours weren’t up to par and the job itself wasn’t very fun.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dv6v6q99b68v802,4.0,I liked working there but it wasn't the right fit for me. The people are really nice. Most of the customers are also. I had a lot of friends there. Being apart of the union was weird at first but it was kinda nice.
Safeway,1dv6el61ub68v803,1.0,"Employees for the most part are very unhappy, but I believe this to be true in most grocery jobs. Managers are way over stressed and its the whole trickle down effect. To be honest there is not enough work to keep you busy unless you work as a picker. The coworkers are always looking for someone to be angry at and management doesn’t back you unless they feel threatened.  If you want to be miserable go get a job there please.  They pay the least in the 302 union."
Safeway,1dv645350osr0800,4.0,Overall it’s a good place to work. There is plenty of room to grow within the company you just have to put in the work. If you do your job you have nothing to worry about.
Safeway,1dv5umtcmq4bs801,3.0,You are going to be alone with your work. It is your job to make sure that the pallets you are building will fit. You need to be able to complete task at a high pace
Safeway,1dv5cpa39ov2h803,5.0,"My experience with working for Safeway was magnificent! I had the privilege of filling a position there as a Front End Cashier/Checker. The company provided paid training and union enrollment. The managers, supervisors, and lead workers there were very understanding and professional. My work schedule was flexible and the company offered decent pay with retirement and awesome benefits! Working for Safeway was an experience I will never forget!"
Safeway,1dv53fc96hctm802,3.0,"I've worked at numerous locations, but the one I worked at most recently was awful. Managers aren't concerned with having the store run well, only with passing inspections from higher-ups. Managers are also slow to help out on the check stands, but don't make a significant effort to hire more people, and I was lied to about where I would be working. I was hired to work the Customer Service desk, but had to help out on the check stands quite often. Eventually the stopped putting me there, but told me they were working on getting me back to customer service. This was a lie, as they were training other people on customer service."
Safeway,1dv4mle65f0jn803,5.0,"Great place to work, nice co workers, a great boss, they work very well with your schedule (going to school). Everyone there helps each other and all the customers are nice and friendly to all the staff. Light easy labor no stress at all."
Safeway,1dv4iv1smhbnp803,2.0,"Safeway in Fort Morgan Colorado, had bad management and usually relied on its lower end employees to support the business. But the experience gained was invaluable and made me more of a manager then ever."
Safeway,1dv4ijam94s1i800,5.0,Once you get used to working this fast paced environment everything else will come natural. Benefits were awesome.Management and senior employees were always available if you needed a helping hand.
Safeway,1dv4ephqtov2g802,2.0,"When working for Safeway, you’re a slave. They expect you to do this and that but give no positive energy back. When going beyond  Repeatedly It doesn’t matter. I used to absolutely love and brag about working for Safeway, now it’s no longer family and friendly oriented. Sadly the moral is up so much at several stores."
Safeway,1dv47fuopf0jn802,1.0,"I was never treated fairly. I was discriminated against in so many levels. No respect for privacy. Management tell your business. Very gossiping place. Pay sucks! I was never paid for my vacation they scheduled me to go out on 2 years in a row! Very racist company. If u work there for many years, these employees can go and shove on minors and nothing was done! This happens to my daughter."
Safeway,1dv3d63q2ov2g803,4.0,"It was good, managers helped me out with a flexible schedule and the people’s union was a great benefit to have and take advantage of. I enjoyed going to work."
Safeway,1dv27nfjbhb8s802,2.0,Very strict work environment. Little training. Anxiety inducing. Fast work pace. Dress codes were rarely followed. The interpersonal drama was commonplace. Few employees stuck to their duties.
Safeway,1dv23erhrhcta802,1.0,I've terminated my employment.
Safeway,1dv1qcdtoo2bd802,4.0,"Good store level management. Friendly co-workers. Is union, for all the good and bad that includes. Feels like a work family. But starting to feel a little corporate."
Safeway,1dv1l8o3ff0sh803,4.0,"When I worked as a personal shopper the whole crew started at 4:00 am and on the schedule we would leave at 8 am, however I was almost impossible to leave before 8 hours. Part time benefits with full time work.  Many people would come in late but they stayed until all orders where done. Very fast place, constantly walking. I did enjoy that jobs. I know things are greatly different now from when I was working."
Safeway,1dv0n9144f232802,5.0,I was in the night crew. The night crew as myself are in charge of merchandising and facing. Nothing much. You do need to work in a fast paced. It's fun.
Safeway,1dv02ip0e2vd4003,1.0,"Working there provided me absolutely nothing. My pay barley helped me pay my bills, and hours were conflicting so I couldn't look for other work opportunities."
Safeway,1dutvovaqhatr801,5.0,productive and positive workplace. I enjoyed the environment and the co-workers are great to work with as well. no problems with management just not enough hours
Safeway,1dustd4bk2vd4003,4.0,I gave my all to this company and eventually the hours got dropped to where I couldn't afford my bills so I needed to find another job to be able to take care of my responsibilities
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dusqg045f232801,2.0,"As a long-time employee, I have had trouble getting what would clearly be given to other long-time employees at a different company. I am not given a work schedule according to my seniority, I am ignored over others who are shown preferential treatment due to age, ethnicity and physical looks, my management team is lacking in communication and gives poor support for customer issues and breaks, which are to be given to employees mandatorily. The company is always trying to find ways to steal employee's benefits. I have worked at many stores and find that for the most part the other employees and management do not care about racism towards African American coworkers/employees. At every store I have worked at, multiple employees/managers have said racial slurs and derogatory words about women. At many stores, I have been treated as a scapegoat, to work long late hours, where when I call for assistance the closing managment does not want to do their job.  As an older person, I'd warn others against taking this job."
Safeway,1durnf8nvo2bd802,5.0,"I loved working here. They were so nice even when they had situations that were serious, they still handled it with kindness and made everyone comfortable with resolving the problem. I learned that even when things got tough you needed to just roll up your sleeves and get the job done. Everyone was treated equally and fair."
Safeway,1durbt8fvhatr800,1.0,Worst job ever rather go hungry and they beat you out your money and manager sucks thinks he better then everyone and terrible job period.would never work for again for nothing..
Safeway,1duqllhjnf232803,2.0,"being a union shop it has its own issues to deal with, the lack of management being consistent there is a problem. If you work hard there in management it can hurt your chances of advancement more then help unless you play their game. lots of promises but not much on follow thru."
Safeway,1duqlkso02vd4001,3.0,"I work as a front end checker. I have part-time status. Extreme micromanaging. Disrespect from most managers, not dept. managers. Hard to make a living with part time work. Very hard work physically and mentally. It's service work, and sometimes the only work available in this town."
Safeway,1duq780jahcta803,2.0,It’s ok  I’ve definitely had better jobs and had a place which cares about my growth within the company. Usually really like working with people but these people don’t know how to create a nice work environment where you’re appreciated
Safeway,1dundis1kold8803,4.0,They send you out for a week's worth of training to learn defensive driving where you get certified. Those are real useful skills that you can use even in your daily driver vehicle.
Safeway,1dunag169p069802,3.0,"The work kept me busy and happy, customers told me they were glad I worked there, but chaos came one day when I was told to resign because Safeway was bought by Albertsons and my manager, whom I trusted, told customers I was terminated."
Safeway,1dun6ss6rhdbl802,2.0,"This was once a wonderful company to work for, and was a place you could make a career out of. Unfortunately, our management has made poor choices over the last decade, and our pay has fallen drastically below what it once was in terms of buying power. Our benefits have gone up significantly in cost while going down in quality. Entry level wages have fallen below fast food, and our turn over is high."
Safeway,1dum6190qp069801,4.0,"Overall I liked working at Safeway, they were very flexible with your schedule and the benefits were great given I didn't work full-time. The benefits included; medical, vision and dental."
Safeway,1dum36n9k4t8q801,5.0,Here when I was at Safeway my coworkers and the customers I’ve had so far they were amazing to work well with I loved my job here at Safeway it was just me in school and the hours they had wasn’t going along with my school schedule so I did stopped working there because of school but before then it was alright the time I had with the Safeway company.
Safeway,1dulth3vbnhe9803,5.0,"The typical day at Safeway is very fast paced and always engaging. The employees and customers are all friendly and easy to communicate with. After working at Safeway long enough, I've began to feel apart of a family."
Safeway,1dulmdi7sq5d1802,5.0,Working at Safeway had been always interesting but I tried my best every time and I didn't not receive help or the hours I was promised so overall it was not great.
Safeway,1dulflc69nhe9805,3.0,"Worked for this company for almost 10 years, best appreciation I received was a lepelle pin after 1 year, nothing else, paid into employee benefits program and never received so much as a card for being in the hospital"
Safeway,1dul5vc8gnhe9802,2.0,Hours were extremely limited. An exhausting environment to work in with not a whole lot of energy at all whatsoever. Would only get about 12-15 hours a week if lucky.
Safeway,1duk84fhkq5d1802,3.0,"If you don’t have a long time with the company, your basically scraps. There is no really room to grow or achieve anything. It’s just a bypassing job."
Safeway,1dujrcnutngql802,1.0,"Another horrible place to work . People are constantly used. Very low wages unless you are a company veteran. Everyone is miserable there and wants to quit ,b ut they are all afraid of losing their benefits ."
Safeway,1dujgdcibq5cr803,4.0,"Management was switching around a lot during my second year, and I started having problems with a particular employee on the night shift, I failed to defend myself and was terminated from the position, though I got good experience and know to go to the manager whenever there's even a question. Coworkers are not always sympathetic, labor is often shared or related to other's labor, and those issues need to be taken up with management when they become problematic. The job itself was good enough. Unfortunately the bakery manager only worked during the day shift."
Safeway,1dujfptt7ov22802,3.0,So far I enjoy cashiering. Very little hours but high turn over rate so I'm sure I'll collect more hours as I go. Most employees are easy going and easy to talk to.
Safeway,1duj71gk9ngql802,4.0,"Responsible in providing good communication, staff friendly, excellent problem solving skills. Safeway meets quality standard in target sales."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1duitrs94ov21800,3.0,Because when I got hurt at work know one supported me. They treated me like a stranger like if I was a no body sad to say but true. And if you see someone who gets to put there all into there job they should be nice
Safeway,1duirkcfkhaf8805,5.0,Working with (Safeway) was a great experience and great customer service you had some bad customers but it was just a great experience to encounter good customers and bad customers management was pretty OK also.
Safeway,1duijqpcu3429003,3.0,"While it's difficult to get a promotion, you can still get pay raises based on the hours you work. The more hours you work, the sooner your pay will rise. The union they have requires everyone to start out part-time with only a few exceptions. It will be tough getting to full-time and therefore getting benefits as well."
Safeway,1dui6fchsov22800,3.0,"If you don’t mind a variable schedule (week to week) and can devote at least 20 hours plus a few to the job consistently, Safeway is a good place to earn a part-time paycheck and have a fairly stable job. Most managers at my store are serious about the job and generally good to work with. The work is not glamorous or very lucrative, but can be satisfying at times if you realize your own worth. Sometimes slow and steady actually wins the race."
Safeway,1dugubc6chdnc803,1.0,Paid the Bill's. The managers did not know anything along with very disrespectful to man kind. Would not work for Safeway again the human resource is awful
Safeway,1dugrqr6gp060801,3.0,Major reason for living was that it was understaffed and didn't allow time off for employees who already worked previous holidays on full-time shifts. Unfair scheduling.
Safeway,1dugjpvm10gvs003,3.0,"Safeway was a great place for me to grow my skill set, however advancement and pay and compensation are not the best.  Management also really depends on the group,"
Safeway,1dugfvcb7obrp802,5.0,Safeway is a great place to work.  I met and founded great long term business and personal relationships.  The work was creative and created professional growth.  The downside yet upside was buyouts.
Safeway,1dugb3g0folid802,4.0,It's a pretty good place to work. The customer base is a good one. I feel I help people every day and that makes me feel good about the work I do. I often make someone's day.
Safeway,1dug4et52hdnd802,5.0,"Good workplace, great managment and good pay. People there were like a family, got to know alot of the staff very well and met alot of hard workers. Great overall"
Safeway,1dug2ie1solid801,1.0,"Working here is just like a typical job for any new worker or young adult fresh out of highschool. The pay is minimum wage, the hours are not gauranteed to be 40 hours, unless you work there for years an earn journeymen pay.  Better off working anywhere else that pays minimum wage an gives you 40 hours. Management has no idea what they are doing for nightcrew"
Safeway,1dufpot1vhe31803,5.0,i really liked working here I've learned a lot of skills
Safeway,1dufkr5r50gvs000,3.0,Depending on your job title will judge your day to day work flow. always a busy job environment . working with lots of customers and merchandise. its a good starter job for teens .
Safeway,1duek4lctolid802,4.0,A typical day for me was to clock in and check the catalog to see my hourly duties then to my first job of the day. I learned better costumer service and how to bag groceries. I thought the management could of been better just in the way we did some things around the store. There wasn’t really anything difficult but one thing was learning where everything in the store was located.
Safeway,1due8jj50p060802,3.0,They let me have my hours I want.but they also tell you one thing is okay while another manager will yell at you for the same thing the other manager just told you to do.
Safeway,1duc8i7gb25l5005,1.0,If you want to be a workhorse with no chance of advancing  safeway will be great for you.  They suck to work for!!!! Let me repeat.... they really suck to work for. Have fun getting up every day with no actual purpose to your life.
Safeway,1dubi0oc6obrp803,2.0,"Safeway was a great first job for me. I'd gladly take the opportunity to work there again if I lived close enough. The work felt satisfying and helped push me forward as a person. The management was awful, and it really teaches you how to deal with managers you don't like."
Safeway,1dub1j5j6hdnd802,3.0,"I have worked at grocery stores before and rarely ever heard of high turn over in the meat departments, but that cannot be said at Safeway. While the position is unionized, the entry pay is terribly low (for the amount of work required and expected) and there is very little chance for promotion or pay raises. One person I know who has worked for the company for well over 7 years still makes just barely more than I do, and they could be considered a manager the way they run the department more than the actual department supervisor."
Safeway,1duarscp6hdnc803,4.0,Working at the deli was good. I got to have more experience with working with others and helping customers. All the managers are friendly. Excellent choice for a first job.
Safeway,1duaccgmb4eif803,1.0,Company lies about pay  they say hourly but it is not  they steal money from your trips because it is hard to figure pay  they do not care about their employees you are just a number  the benefits are good only because we are a teamster shop and it is negotiated in contract  the pay is subpar compared to most trucking jobs in the area
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dtv2v6nhhbln803,2.0,When I worked there I was constantly berated and belittled by the management for wanting to join the military. When I went to join they constantly told me that I wouldn't make it. I called HR who did absolutely nothing about it.
Safeway,1dtup5dnkq59n803,1.0,Horrible Hiring manager you only get trained on the computer they barely train you on the register they harass you if you go on your breaks and they think you are taking long when you barely went on your break
Safeway,1dtudvdvap04r802,4.0,"Loved my coworkers, but management was often disrespectful and/or mean. Management had conflicts of interest with hiring their own kids and hiring their kids’ significant others. Little flexibility given for work scheduling."
Safeway,1dtsqa915f12j803,1.0,Negitive is my review. Lie to customers everyday was not what I signed up for . management pass the buck every chance they get .  being a bullie is encouraged in management
Safeway,1dtsm20csnh9j801,2.0,"Great job for HS kids or retired folks.  Expectations are high and advancement is slow.  If you value customer service and a fast pace, this is a job you will enjoy."
Safeway,1dtrjervs33nc002,4.0,"The work load is fine, we get the work done. We have are own pace to get things done under the time frame. Production is durable. Supervisors are approachable."
Safeway,1dtpcdl1eq59n802,4.0,"You will be given plentiful opportunities to seek guidance and understanding about what your job is and how you can do it to the fullest of your ability. There isn't an answer that you cannot find from the supportive management team. Unfortunately, that also regards personal information. Be cautious with what information you share. By the end of the night, everyone will know about it."
Safeway,1dtp222hmp04r803,3.0,Union company benefits ok but pay is small to what is expected of you a lot of hours cut to meet store sales.
Safeway,1dtosb2r6nh9j803,3.0,"The work is easy, just stacking boxes all day, the thing that’s a little bit more difficult is keeping up with the minutes they give you per order. You have to be running all day to get your minutes. Can’t use the bathroom otherwise your percentage drops which puts you at risk of getting written up."
Safeway,1dtoqbtu6p04r801,2.0,Two faced They say one thing but do another they say they care they don’t tell you you’re going to be hired full-time but it’s part time they offer advancements after too much time and too little money
Safeway,1dtmp4o6dnh9j803,5.0,"Work with Safeway was one of my best experience seen the  respect, from the CEO to the management to the personnel. Fun because all the training we had to take every year, helped all of us managements to grow up faster and learn how to get meet the productivity and safety engagement  the personnel and"
Safeway,1dtmc4biif12j801,5.0,I have enjoyed my time  working in this retail company. I am just ready to move forward and make more money. I have topped out at journey man and life has more demands than the pay I currently receive.  I also would like to offer more of my skills to a company for which my current position does not require.
Safeway,1dtm8kap2nh9j803,2.0,"Awful place to work, management hates everyone and gets nothing done. This leads to people who hate their job. However there are a few shining stars who work there and made the whole experience bearable, which is amazing because Safeway really sucked"
Safeway,1dtm64v3vhc33802,5.0,I was pleased with the overall foreseeing of the managers on site. They were fair to everyone’s schedule and tried to accommodate . Personally my manager was very nice and understanding yet complied to everything f she needed
Safeway,1dtkq8j9k33nu00a,5.0,I loved working at the Safeway Pharmacy. The fast paced environment made for a fast work day. There is always something new to learn and a new way to improve yourself.
Safeway,1dtkp1bivp04r803,5.0,I learn something new at my job and I work hard and and always on time and I work with mangers and I woke with employees and tryin go my best at work and I wanna try new things at work
Safeway,1dtkl6mj9hc33803,5.0,people were very nice and energized all times of the day there was never a dole moment people also were very helpful if you needed anything I would recommend this job
Safeway,1dtkib9odnh9j803,3.0,Safeway was a great entry job. It was my first job after babysitting for 8 years. Plenty of different positions to try and explore. Very flexible with scheduling
Safeway,1dtkg21h6q59n803,5.0,I learned a lot in that  job learned how to do cashier & also be in charge of the store a few times . I started as a courtersey clerk & move myself up because I like facing challenges in life
Safeway,1dtk96d07p04r802,5.0,I really enjoy working inside Safeway because one day I will be making coffee at Starbucks and the next day They will request my help bagging grocery and escorting customers to their car and loading bags in the car for them.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dtc81o9ko2bu802,4.0,ok place of work for new job seekers. teaches you customer service skills and even new life skills. recommended to teens for a part time job. good managers.
Safeway,1dtc4q60h33nu003,1.0,Corporate has a clear attitude of superiority over their associates. They do not like people who are intelligent and do not like to advance careers. Cheap company who slashes hours of higher paid in order to hire cheaper labor. Avoid!!!!
Safeway,1dtc4lvuop04r803,3.0,"i did not have a good job experience. the Safeway in Bellevue the management was not friendly they never worked with  your schedule, i ended up leaving on medical leave and i wont go back"
Safeway,1dtc2c6quq59n803,1.0,"I am glad that this my position at Safeway is a stop gap job. I truly feel sorry for the people who have to spend their lives working in Safeway's retail sector. Sure its retail and you get difficult customers at times. And I must say that working at Safeway really forced me to grow up and mature as a man, something I am truly in debt to Safeway for. However, the things that have made my experience horrible is the nature of management. I have noticed that there is a lot of favoritism at Safeway. So really be on the lookout! Having talked to some one who has worked for the company for over 30 years I have come to realize that Safeway really needs to work on fixing her retail sector due to the level of favoritism it is."
Safeway,1dtbu1uh633nu005,3.0,"Working at Safeway was good as a first job experience, but I wouldn't recommend being there long term. When I worked there, management had trouble communicating exactly what we were supposed to be doing/ what they needed us to be doing, and often it differed from manager to manager on what we were supposed to do. There was never a clear goal."
Safeway,1dtblnh03q3ma802,5.0,"I had a lot of fun working in the deli, I was able to learn and operate a lot of heavy machinery. I also was able to work within a team but also alone."
Safeway,1dt9qpjg6nh9j802,3.0,Fun and friendly place to work. Great people and environment. They work with your schedule and are very understanding. Take the time to help and show you the right way to do the job.
Safeway,1dt87fnp6f12j801,3.0,"The company ""Safeway"" is a good company to work for if you don't plan to be their for a time because they go through so many employees and only have a short amount of hours they can give each what often happens is they hire a new person and take your hours away and give them to a new person even though you have been their longer"
Safeway,1dt80i3dap04r803,5.0,they were very kind and very clean they treat people with alot of respect. they also help with things if you dont understand them. they are very clean enviroment.
Safeway,1dt7o00utp04r802,4.0,I liked most of my managers and they worked with my availability.  Sometimes we were understaffed. I enjoyed my time and would consider going back if I needed second job.
Safeway,1dt7l5lf1f12j800,3.0,"I can speak for management at other stores, but the store I am assigned to, the management is horrible. To give you an idea, customers complain often about the managers and the operations the managers are responsible for."
Safeway,1dt728mtlp0dg803,3.0,Can be a good company to work for.  Can get different benefits depending on position. Depends on what you want out of life. Can gain experience in different skill sets if you apply yourself.
Safeway,1dt6tr99jf12j803,5.0,"I’ve been there for a year and I really liked it, they gave me flexibility with my hours and they thought me how to do my job well. Would recommend this job to anyone starting out."
Safeway,1dt6ma4hrnh9j802,2.0,Its good for a starter job. Learning lots of task and ask to take on lots of things. However management can be an issue at some stores and there is a lot of in and out of sometimes bothersome co-workers. They also don't like working with you about ur schedule.
Safeway,1dt5rcjadf12j802,3.0,"There are many different departments with different managers, most are fair and just. And there is one that just is way way too ignorant to even be a manager, don’t call in to be late or you will get fired with this manager. By the way it’s the deli manager in springerville az"
Safeway,1dt4ra1d9f12j801,1.0,"While I enjoyed working with some of my coworkers, the department and store management was abysmal. My schedule was all over the place after having been there for over 3 years and it changed every single week.  I was accidentally injured at work by my manager and was required by a doctor to take a month off of work. When I returned I was no longer the assistant manager. I was told by store management that I was the best worker in the produce department and even got employee of the month.  I worked very hard and after my injury everything went downhill. I had good management early on, but when it switched to bad management, there was nothing I could do.  I DO NOT recommend for anyone to work there!"
Safeway,1dt4qnl7gq59n802,1.0,A lot of mind games at Safeway. They work you very hard & expect more & more out of you. A lot of customers treat you very badly & management rarely has your back
Safeway,1dt49uoimf12j803,1.0,"Management is comeplety disrespectful , Racial Profiling , under paid work , drama in the work envierment, unapid overtime , expecting more work with less people"
Safeway,1dt3v7j84q59n800,4.0,it is a good place to work with good people. work a lot of hours but enjoy the environment. I enjoy the atmosphere as well. it really has all amenities as well
Safeway,1dt35lfe0nh9j802,5.0,"I been with the same staff for 14 years.  Staff are professional, easy to get along, and very supporting. When you have such a great supporting staff, then I can concentrate on putting all my effort into taking care of patients"
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dt2dic4uq59n803,3.0,"After working there for some time the store was under staffed and was needed people in other departments. I was asked if i would want to move departments with added hours, instead of being moved I was split between two departments with less hours then what I had and an inconsistent schedule without a two week notice of my hours. This continued for some time till i quit. Prior to the above statement we in the bakery had orders to fry an extra 30 to 50 dozen donuts for a different local store, daily and be ready before the store open, without extra time or  staff. Eventually the store even cut back the time we had to prepare for the store opening."
Safeway,1dt09qsr6hc33802,1.0,"This store is the smallest in all of Colorado but the demands for production by corporate are based on a much larger store which presses the overworked understaffed environment. Front end workers do the most but get paid the very least, multiple health code violations in the back rooms are often overlooked and management is affluent. ZERO DIVERSITY at this location. Take your business and or work ethics somewhere else."
Safeway,1dssjg2ebp04r801,3.0,"SAFEWAY has a great environment, but their pay is insufficient.  I was commuting to the Bay Area from San Jouaquin County and the pay wasn’t worth the commitment.  It may be a good job for Highschool or College students.  Those who got paid well had been there for more than 10 years."
Safeway,1dssg6f69nh9j802,3.0,If you’re adaptable then this company is great for you. People development was my favorite thing to come to do with future managers. Very busy but overall good.
Safeway,1dss90615nh9j802,1.0,"Even though I completely hated working there. I still pushed to get everything I was assigned and then some. I worked harder than anyone else in my position. I wanted to move, every time they offered, I accepted but never did move up, the most they did for me was gave me employee of the month and a $25 gift card for the store. For whatever reason, they weren't able to move me up/and or increase pay."
Safeway,1dsq9tmoeq59n801,3.0,This job was a volunteer job through my youth transition program in high school so I do not know if it would be a good job to have for full time work..
Safeway,1dsq5dl4bnh9j804,4.0,"Working for a big company like Safeway, you get a lot of aggravating customers. Working here tested my patience and has helped me grow as a person. It wasn’t all to fun but was a good work experience"
Safeway,1dsppval0p04r801,5.0,I wish I would have stayed. Good people to work with. Very flexible with your work schedule. Management needs to pay attention to the work the employees are giving and not just people who knows how to talk and no performance at all.
Safeway,1dspig0bho2bu800,1.0,"Worked there for 3 years and besides my supervisor and a few friends I met along the way, it was horrible. Management only cared about the money and if you weren't making his numbers look good you were on his bad side. I felt like I was slowly dying there. Unless your in high school and want something temporary, sure go ahead. But do not expect making a living unless your a manager or higher up."
Safeway,1dsouoc5l33nc001,3.0,"This review applies to the cashier position at Safeway. Over all it's not a bad job. But it's definitely not something that I would want to do for the rest of my life.The job is easy, but will get boring and tiring overtime. The more hours that you work as a cashier in a week the more your feet, legs, and hips will hurt at the end of the day. Breaks for a cashier at the Safeway in Springerville Arizona are not good at all. You get one ten minute break every four hours. You are supposed to get a half hour lunch at some point if you work eight or more hours in a day, but the management will usually only give you two ten minute breaks unless you are one of their rare full time employees. As far as pay goes it is a minimum wage job, and you will either not be able to support yourself, or you will have to live at the edge of your income. They are however a lot more flexible with their schedules and hours than a lot of other retailers. One other thing that I should mention is that Safeway is regularly visited by union representatives that spend a day trying to get new employees to join the union."
Safeway,1dsoee1c4q59n801,5.0,Working. With.  Sareway. It. Was. A. Good. Work. With. The. The. People.  Of. Safeway.  Co.  I. Learn.  All. Lot.  From.  Safeway.  I. Had. Support.  My. Work
Safeway,1dso6o0hdq59n802,2.0,Horrible management and the union representative never really did anything about how people are unfairly  treated by management .  There were numerous calls and complaints from employees and customers. Instead of reprimanding them they got promoted.
Safeway,1dsnof504f12j801,1.0,Im I had a front end manager that bullied people to no end follow them in the breakroom follow them into the bathroom couldn't let me use the bathroom and treated me like s*** I wouldn't wish this job on my worst enemy! Management's terrible there to cliquish be careful when you work there
Safeway,1dsngdhk1p04r802,4.0,"Safeway is a great company to work for, all other aspects of the departments are great except the bakery. The employees that had been there forever were extremely rude, the manager wasn't cooperating. Outside of the bakery, Safeway is a excellent place to work."
Safeway,1dsnbapr3f12j803,3.0,"Great people, hard to move up and not too many options for more pay. .Com is definitely one of the more stressful departments, especially if you're running shifts and not getting compensated well for it."
Safeway,1dsm4edj0p04r802,3.0,safeway has changed so much ever since it switched under different management. there are so much works to do much no support from staff and upper management
Safeway,1dslng2p8p04r802,5.0,You learn how to work in a fast paced environment. You get to bake and decorate delicious pastries or cakes. I personally loved to decorate custom cake orders.
Safeway,1dsldfmt4o2bu803,1.0,Managers treat the employees horrible It’s a s*** show everyday! The managers and Gm need to be replaced if Safeway wants to see improvements. High turn over of employees because no one wants to work with the current managers !
Safeway,1dskickilp04r803,4.0,"Responsibilities included bagging, go backs, cleaning out the car corrals, cleaning the bathrooms, cleaning the front end, and other general front end assistance - including helping customers with what they might need."
Safeway,1dsk1k8dmf12j803,5.0,"Showed growth and hard work and dedication,  loyalty. Started from bottom, finished on top.  Great pay, benefits,  paid vacations and agreed to become a certified trainer which I ended up being a great asset to the company."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dsidsltohc33802,5.0,"Everyone I worked with at my Safeway is really friendly and makes it easier to work there. The only issue is, the pay is lower than other similar companies."
Safeway,1dsicu08qf12j803,1.0,Managment and pay was horrible for experienced grocery store operators.
Safeway,1dsgg5tkjq3ma802,3.0,The company only really cares about the amount of revenue they can bring in. They set unrealistic expectations of how you’re supposed to act while working regardless of how you’re treated. The work load isn’t even worth the minimum wage that they offer you and you can only   access your “benefits” after about five years so they don’t really help. Overall the work environment is not really the best.
Safeway,1dsgf7ni8q3m9801,3.0,"Every shift it was something new to learn and handle, I got the hang of it including manager duties in case they were absent when needed, including western union transactions, lotteries or counting down the register at the end of the day. Hardest part would be a customer causing problems, other than that it was a fun place."
Safeway,1dsfq0hvrnh9j802,4.0,"Food production driven.  Time management is key, you have to move pretty steadily to accomplish all tasks.  Learning to be flexible and help co-workers when needed is important.  The most challenging part of my job, is to accomplish all of my tasks everyday.  This becomes difficult because in addition to completing my daily list of items to make, I have to assist customer at the counter with their deli orders.  I really like the customers and providing great customer service."
Safeway,1dse9u8sjnh5h802,1.0,It's cool for your first job. Don't get stuck here. They don't take care of employees. The only way you make money is if you're a store director other than that no good
Safeway,1dsdep6fsq4a1803,5.0,It was good welcoming environment. The mangers and some of the staff understood my challenges and helped me along the way to make sure was good and successful.
Safeway,1dsddheeof34h801,1.0,"I did not have a good experience. The managers were biased, and I was treated with disdain when I had to change my availability. It was hard work for low pay."
Safeway,1dsdbhp4lf34h803,3.0,"Took first job I could find. Enjoyed the job at first, but got discouraged after they moved me to another position without talking to me. I lived to far away for this to be a good fit for me. But they helped me and I thank them for that."
Safeway,1dsctqcm74820802,3.0,It’s ok I gotta a lot customers and self checkout isn’t the best to deal with and I also face and do a lot of stocking for the shelves but the managers are alright
Safeway,1dsb4rm5mnre9802,3.0,Working here is a great place for anyone who is in high school or is looking for a place to start a job. Management isn’t all that great but that can be different from location to location.
Safeway,1ds9qifcknh50802,4.0,I work part time over night putting merchandise on the shelf’s and organizing them when I’m finished. I work alone and have 9 aisles to do by myself. I work from 11pm to 7am.
Safeway,1ds9h1b2nnrea803,2.0,Corporate doesn't have a clue. The employees are lazy and do whatever they want but they're nice people. The theft is ridiculous so corporate tries to save money at the employees and paying customers cost.
Safeway,1ds91fb84brcl802,3.0,Min wage for max duties. I fill in as front end manager with no increase in pay. 10 cents an hour pay increase for every 1200 hours work till step 10.
Safeway,1ds8thi23b80m803,4.0,"Working for Safeway was a good place to work for they help you learn new things. When I first started I would do food samples and then the registers, and customer service."
Safeway,1ds7t2v7snrea801,5.0,"Start work,  deal with great customers , learn a new perspective from customers . Management is always positive . Company striving to always help customers .  Having to leave With task not done. The customer are one of the most enjoyable Part about the Job."
Safeway,1ds7d8j75h44j800,3.0,"I felt like I learned the daily routine at the bakery pretty quickly, At least that's what I thought. I constantly asked them how I was doing and they never had any complaints just some everyday tips, such as smile more. When I got my first paycheck my co-workers were as confused as I was to see i was not on the schedule. I called every day for 2 or 3 days waiting to see when I should come in but the manager for my section always had an excuse. I started to get frustrated and decided to call the store manager and she told me a whole different story. She said the Bakery Manager decided my ""trial period was unsatisfactory"". I've worked at a handfull of different places for the past 5 years and not once have I heard that, let alone just been removed from the schedule without an explanation. I was never told why the manager made that decision after telling me I was doing great. The hardest part of the job was honestly stacking the bagged bread because you had to read the dates as well as put the older ones on the top which sounds easy but is genuinely hard. The most enjoyable part of the job is hard to choose because there were many. I enjoyed my co-workers, including the manager regardless of what happened. By far the very best part was honestly the smell. The kitchen always smelled of pastries and it was the best. In conclusion, I loved the experience I just wish I knew what I did wrong."
Safeway,1ds6q3fhjnhhr802,4.0,It was a good leaning experience of what I would like and what is too much for me to learn it wasn’t my best job but it was also my first and I struggled a lot didn’t have much support especially since I had a disability and learning now how to disclose that but ya .
Safeway,1ds69kn4dnosn802,4.0,Enjoyable work place and good people to work with. Unfortunately relocated living location and could no longer work with the company. Would recommend for good valet position
Safeway,1ds68fs14f12p803,3.0,"Opportunity to advance in career.  Low level work with low pay due to union contract is the norm but exceptional workers can be moved into management quickly.  Top end of union contract pays in the low end of retail workers. Runs a tight labor model to maintain profits, sometime unrealistically but mostly fair.  Corporate model is very strict.  Local management is firm but fair and encourages putting in the time to move up."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1ds682oltp06l802,4.0,"The benefits that come with the job are great, and if you like getting paid weekly it might be the place for you. You don’t get much training so that’s a downfall!"
Safeway,1ds5q241ih40g802,4.0,Overall it was good however schedules needed to be out earlier and pay and hours needs to increase so that I may afford to live the work was hard but the people were fun to be around we reached our goals by working together
Safeway,1ds58tjrvotmf802,3.0,Definitely room to grow. Any position in management is extremely stressful. Safeway holds high standards that are sometimes extremely hard to meet. With the limited hours given per department to staff with. Suprise audits keep you constantly stressed.
Safeway,1ds536oe25n8i802,5.0,"Friendly work environment and a perfect first job. There is a workers union at this job, so it is a pretty secure job. Also, the bosses and coworkers are all friendly and form a family like environment."
Safeway,1ds3eus9ip06l802,3.0,The best part was interacting with the customers and most of the employees with whom I worked with. Management was good for a while and then the store manager and assistant manager left and management went downhill from there.
Safeway,1ds32kj49brci803,5.0,"I really enjoyed working here. I worked mostly in the liquor department, but assisted in other departments when needed. My work was appreciated and acknowledged by management and there was plenty of room for growth."
Safeway,1ds1p227gb80j800,4.0,"We were brought in to make all the needed changes in their databases, because Albertsons bought out Safeway. Work was repetitive and quite simple.  I made all necessary changes in their PeopleSoft database for employees salaries, and pay raises; as well as job titles.  At times there would be benefit changes for certain employees."
Safeway,1ds0istt0o1ai803,3.0,"My work was okay, I did my work normally and had put my best into my tasks. I wasn’t well paid though and my schedule was always small since they wouldn’t fit me in for school. The team there wasn’t very nice but I bared through it all."
Safeway,1drtj0al5nq4v802,4.0,"I work the Night Crew, and it's a hit or miss with hours. They say they'll give you more, but never do. So I just take what I can and look for other and better opportunities within the store."
Safeway,1drt9i880otmf802,4.0,The company was bought out from another company . It’s been very different since and not for the good. As a employee I don’t feel appreciated by the company. I feel used and under pay. I lost my full time status cause I transfer to another store . Now it’s like I’m starting over again from the beginning and the company doesn’t care about my finances.
Safeway,1drt7ivbub84l802,5.0,It was an amazing job but I lived an hour and a half away I had to take Bart and bus everyday until I got a car and then I felt like I was more of a manager then just a shift manager so I quit
Safeway,1drrpra9d24ff004,5.0,"Started as a part time clerk and moved up at my pace.  Became a Store Director at my own pace.  I have learned a lot about merchandising, customer service, and being a leader.  The upper management works with scheduling and family events,"
Safeway,1drrg1jg7b84l802,3.0,U have no control over the schedule they force u to give request days off but denied urs they tell when ur r allow to have days off even in slow times u get paid the same as the clerks to b a manager only incentive is the maybe bonus but u get to do 10x more than anyone in ur department even finish their tasks left over from their shift n if u don’t u get in trouble not them no disciplinary  action when major failure occur in ur team n u go under staff for months just to b given high wage clerks who can help u
Safeway,1drrf2lf1h44g802,1.0,Very under handed people working at the corporate level. It was plenty of opportunity in the beginning and the 3 ladies whom ran that department were great by far very caring. As the 3 ladies were replaced or moved and others came in it went straight down and very crooked !!!!
Safeway,1drrbond0b84l804,3.0,Is a simple operation they tell you every thing the like you to do on the weekly bases. you can not make any different decision from what they like you to do is there way or no way.
Safeway,1drr5354v25lu008,2.0,I applied for safeway cause I couldn't find away warehouse positions here in trinidad and small story short I didn't like that they placed me in a different position than what I applied for so I left.
Safeway,1drr4eue7h40g804,1.0,The manager and her bully assistant manager are heartless. The meat department manager hid sardines in a coworkers area. The other twisted managers thought it was funny.
Safeway,1drr1qb30b88h803,1.0,Having to work for a Company that hires complaining employees I don’t feel good around them at all. It don’t make any sense why Safeway management don’t have professional skills to tell employees they need to understand the high rate as a customer service should be honors through out the stores employees even the Managers ways they treat other employees with know favoritisms.  It’s was a lot of that going around at SAFEWAYS.
Safeway,1drquku33b84l802,4.0,"Pays well, but little work life balance. Benefits and retirement are also competitive. Holidays are crazy busy, and leaves little time to be with family."
Safeway,1drqnsun0otlr803,4.0,Greeted all customers and provided them with prompt and courteous assistance
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1drn2i5dp1d0a003,3.0,"I learned a great deal from my time spent here. Mainly that retail was not for me. As a person who values a close customer worker relationship, that was not the environment provided."
Safeway,1drmqvin01fdr001,3.0,Busy workplace with great customers and co-workers.  Upper Management expectations and appreciation lacking.  Disappointed in mandatory hour reductions mandated despite the consistent volume of prescriptions dispersed and increase of daily duties.  Monetary raises are few and far between.
Safeway,1drmfcf8v1fdr002,3.0,"Safeway was my first job and it provided me with an opportunity to learn the importance of character building and providing good customer service. The job was very engaging, constant interactions with people for hours on end. Throughout the years of working at Safeway, I've definitely felt more comfortable about myself in terms of applying myself in social settings. I can say I stand out more than a lot of people and always strive to be the ""light of the party,"" all thanks to working at Safeway for giving me a voice."
Safeway,1drme2kf024fp002,3.0,It’s ok place  to work but I wouldn’t try and make a career the department managers I was with were really good but the store director is the complete opposite I can safely
Safeway,1drm88peq1d0a000,1.0,"At first, safeway might seem like a good place to work, or a good first job to have. However, the longer you work there the more stuck you'll feel. The worse they will treat you. If you show your full potential as a worker right away, they will expect it constantly and treat you badly if you slack even a little bit. If you plan on working here, I would advise you dont show your full potential right away, if at all, as they clearly do not value you as a person."
Safeway,1drm12d86f21l802,3.0,Working at Foster city Safeway was not on the list of my favorite jobs. Management didnt communicate with each other well and if you were fake enough you could make friends.
Safeway,1drm00fat24e9004,1.0,They are unsanitary and always have spoiled meats and attempt to sell them for half price. They have cashiers doing everyone else’s job If someone calls out or If they don’t feel like doing it. They’ll cut your hours whenever they feel like it.
Safeway,1drk6s9l524e8003,3.0,The store manager can use organization with hours and flexibility.  I enjoy working here however the manager is not a team player and does not provide flexibility to employees.
Safeway,1dri1frt81d19002,3.0,"As a fuel attendant customer service and needs , especially Safety , are our 1st priority, I also handled high cash volume and security thereof , register handling , also fuel spill clean-up procedures , adherence to local and state requirements regarding checking identification  , and different types of payment methods , also fuel dispenser maintenance and preventive maintenance . There is hardly a better feeling than being attentive to customer needs and they ask to see your name tag to thank you by name ."

Safeway,1dre6vlq41fdq000,3.0,Overall very poor at providing the hours needed to make an income. Even part time I got 4 hours a week which is nuts. I wish I could say different because I have faith in Safeway before working there but now I cant even go shopping there because I feel embarrassed for the company of their poor service.
Safeway,1drdubh5dhcee802,5.0,The managers and coworkers are what make you want to show up to work everyday. They treat you like family and they care about your family at home. The company of Albertsons itself though they work you and you get paid nothing for your time.
Safeway,1drdcuol81d19002,4.0,Some became family of Staff. Good Experience. Always Busy. Great First Job. Well benefits. Payed Weekly..Great foos and quality. Rewards and Gas Points are great.

The employees are rude at the summit location and unwelcoming to new hires. Too much work for the amount of pay. Left within 2 days of getting hired, such a horrible place to work"
Safeway,1drd3clqr1fdq000,3.0,Working at Safeway was decent at first but they had me doing the same repetitive process constantly. I let the company know before I was hired that I would be missing a week for my fathers wedding in Mexico. Unfortunately afterwards when I got home I wasn’t feeling well so I went to the doctor and found out I had Ecoli and had to be put on antibiotics. My doctor gave me a note for work saying that I needed a week to recover. When I came back the store manager called me to his office and said that  the note only covered for 1 day and that I was fired. I honestly was going to quit anyways cause I was moving to Texas that month to go to college.
Safeway,1drd1qs57q4om802,1.0,"Terrible management, when you're on training they aren't clear they just leave you on your own to figure it out, short staff ALWAYS, mis treated by co-workers and you won't get the hours that you're guaranteed to get."

Safeway,1drcf0tvd0mtp002,3.0,"I worked there almost 6 yrs before I found something else that I enjoyed. The place was very family friendly the management was great they were always helpful, and handled ALL of my concerns the first time around I would recommend them and I still do."
Safeway,1drc7vu3l24e8002,5.0,"i give safeway a 4 review rating. I like that I get to talk and work with customers,  I get full time hours. the only negatives are there is a union that you have to pay into but are not allowed to recieve benefits for 18 months."
Safeway,1drbhc2d31fdq002,5.0,A typical day at work is a great day. I learn so much every day. I love my management. The culture in the workplace is wonderful. The hardest part of the job is lifting heavy items. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I get things done and I feel accomplished.

Safeway,1drbdmkjq1d19008,4.0,"There is a lot expected of you for a little to equal compensation. They strive to improve moral but the overall company benefits, pay, and incentives are none existant."
Safeway,1drb6d96t1fdq001,2.0,"Management played favorites, especially between male managers and female employees. I had open availability and was one of the quickest and friendliest cashiers with perfect secret shopping scores and still was only given 24 hours a week. I rarely called in sick and always showed up for scheduled shifts and stayed for overtime whenever I was asked. Not a good work/life balance. Good place to work if you’re a student or a mom just wanting part time hours, otherwise not the best place to work."
Safeway,1drb3sfqg1d09001,4.0,"This was a long time ago, the company has since been bought out by another company, so my review would not be accurate in any way at this frame of time"
Safeway,1draeifr31d0s003,4.0,It was just like any other job show up do your work
Safeway,1dra928t61fdq001,3.0,"Safeway was a pretty decent place to work for those few years I was with them. I made a few friends there whom I still keep in touch with, and I was compensated fairly well during the time I was there, even got a slight bump up when the state minimum wage went up a couple years back. Though I do remember our managers shifting out a lot at the Store level: we never had the same Assistant Manager for more than a few months or so for a good while near the middle of my run there. It stayed solid near the end though."
Safeway,1dr899rgl1fdn003,5.0,Safeway taught me a lot of new things and added to my customer service skills. This job gave me confidence since my superiors had so much faith in me since the first time meeting me.
Safeway,1dr7v8enj1d03003,3.0,Honestly working there was terrible the people working there running the place have no idea what there doing there or how to run a store my manager tried to fight me multiple times and constantly had a problem with me when i was just trying to do my job.
Safeway,1dr7bjji624ei003,3.0,I enjoy all my customers. Safeway should be more involved with relationships with employees at least recognizing some work ethics. Overall I have found a home there even though they don't offer full time which I totally disagree with.

Safeway,1dr6q9u101d02002,4.0,It wasn’t a bad job. I loved it. Just for the hours I was putting in and the pay I was getting it wasn’t worth it. I was away from my son for too long and I wasn’t making enough money to support him.
Safeway,1dr6okghc24e2003,3.0,"If you are a hard worker they will take advantage of you. Many months - working harder than anyone else doing the same job. My output was by far an away over expectations and not once did I get a pat on the back, any praise or a raise."

Safeway,1dqvms1q5brfp802,2.0,"Instead of hiring good help like myself and giving a decent wage, benefits and respect.  Corporate thinks they can just keep overturning the help.  Not only does this effect employees but also the customers too.  Customers are your "" Business""!  Employees are not happy for having to work 21 days on with no time off 10-12 hr days.  The customers aren't  happy when your products and services are lacking of no help"
Safeway,1dqv5p9pdbrfp802,4.0,"Great first job, could be stressful at times but nothing that would follow me home and was often easily/quickly reconciled.  Very flexible hours while I was in school and good choice in employees, I've stayed in contact with most of them."

Safeway,1dqnlpv21h3ii803,4.0,"Start the day off just by helping customers by putting groceries in their car if needed, take items back to the respected shelves, sweep aisles, clean bathrooms, and bag groceries. I worked at two locations, one was very slow since it was in an elderly community, the other was busy since it was in a city. The hardest part of the job was being able to please customers in a scenario where I had to no control over the situation. The most enjoyable part is when customers come back due to customer service skills."

Safeway,1dqmqjorj5j5t803,1.0,Safeway is the worst company I have ever worked for. I was a Manager and the pressure put on me to put on the employees was horrid. Minimum wages and high expectations from employees were not worth it so the turn over was extremely high and we pushed the dependable employees to quit as well as they were worked to death.

Safeway,1dql9h6n11d0i001,1.0,"Management is not personable, or care about anything other than number. People are just numbers, not actually people to them.

Safeway,1dq0lb6tubrf8800,2.0,"My coworkers were great however management and customers often made the job more difficult/stressful than it needed to be. There was no consistency with my schedule which made it difficult to plan things with family/friends. The job also became very monotonous after a while, there is definitely room to move up the ladder if you want to but I had no plan on investing in a long term career with Safeway."
Safeway,1dq0iupjpb8be800,2.0,Was not a great place to work Was a very stressful work environment Hardwork only meant that they would give you more work with less time corporate controls to many aspects which lead to shrink to which you are blamed for even though you’re more or less forced
Safeway,1dq0ikntub8be802,5.0,"get there an hour early and get your equipment ready, you need to start your order 5 min after you punch in and when you go to break you need to respect the time that you are given so you would not lose time on your order that goes the same if you are doing forklift"
Safeway,1dq0fg42hh3i7802,5.0,It was a very nice place to work. The co workers and manager was very nice and helpful. the was very nice and on time with the interview. I would recommend anyone to work for Safeway.
Safeway,1dpvb4ekhh426800,2.0,"I really did enjoy my time there,till about the 5th or 6th year,but if given the chance to work there again,i would not be interested at all""i realixed the didnt care much about the employees""once i did get the joy""but i did thank them for the experience..."
Safeway,1dptu9fc9h464803,5.0,"Working for Safeway offered many life skills, job experience, and fun coworkers. I learned how to work hard for the things I wanted, and how to best assist others in need effectively. another benefit I had received from working for Safeway was providing excellent customer service efficiently and thoughtfully. My coworkers were absolutely wonderful, I learned so much from them and i worked well with all of them."
Safeway,1dptr9o2vb87i800,4.0,"I honestly can't say much here. It was a long time ago when I worked here. I learned a lot afterwards to help me look back. A lot of the issues I had back then were fixed/resolved after some shifts happened with the company, I think."
Safeway,1dptlfknub87i802,4.0,"Good job if you are in school, they really try and work with your schedule and try and accommodate you. Easy to move up if that's what you want/ are looking for."
Safeway,1dptifcttb83u800,1.0,"The management is immature, play favoritisms, lack leadership and respect. They do not care that you are a student, parent or have an other responsibility outside of Safeway. They wasn’t Safeway to be priority in your life and don’t pay enough for it. Your hours are inconsistent and you don’t get paid more if they throw you in a different department you weren’t hired in. They over work you with no care."
Safeway,1dps2iiplb8ba802,2.0,"the work space was very fast paced, but i just didn't get the opportunity to advance in payment as much as i would like to, but they will let you learn as much as your willing to work."
Safeway,1dprl8roibrf1802,4.0,"I was constantly on my toes.   On busy days, which was pretty much everyday customers traveling on cruises would come in and order a variety of meals and dishes."

Safeway,1dpqve6ckb8ba80c,2.0,"A typical day for me was filled with negativity. The expectation to finish your job duties was high, with little to no support. Hours were consistently cut, and pay was not great for the amount of time you had to put in off the clock to finish your job duties."
Safeway,1dppamjj1b87i800,4.0,I only worked in the deli department while at Safeway. I did not turn out to be a great fit for the deli department but in total my interactions with Safeway were positive.
Safeway,1dpnqblp55ndh800,4.0,"Although much of the work at Safeway pharmacy was repetitive, every day brought new challenges and expanding expectations. The workplace culture was challenging. The management culture was kind yet very confrontational. The most enjoyable part of working at Safeway was the opportunity to grow into more responsibility and self governing roles so long as I put the effort and time into the work and tasks at hand."
Safeway,1dpnmprfgh3u4800,1.0,"I was excited to work their at first but quickly realized it had been a mistake to work there at all, the store manager daily made all the managers cry , like tears flowing and all that and these people where really good at their job but he just yelled all the time and made it so stressful we had an extremely high turn over rate of both workers and mng's and it was almost 2-3 years to finally get the company to remove him . i watched him actually ""break"" a person"""
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dpmoe5ggb83u802,3.0,"A typical day is not too fast & not too slow . I learned how to find things around the store with more ease . Management is alright .Over all a pretty swell workplace. the hardest part was most of my coworkers not doing there jobs, there for i did those things for them and never got the appropriate recognization. I loved helping out customers and the human interaction ingeneral and everything in the produce department was fun to me :)"
Safeway,1dplsqtccbrf1802,4.0,"To keep it short, there will be days where it seems like the world is about to end; and others where it will be just fine. It depends on customers and who you're working with that day. Some of the managers and clerks are extremely rude and completely non-understanding of situations you could be in. Regardless, the company itself is great with you and its likely you will have a positive experience,"
Safeway,1dplpbh1mh3i7801,2.0,• Lead a 3-man team planning and scheduling shifts for indoor and outdoor customer services
Safeway,1dplp2nemh426802,3.0,"It's a fast paced environment.Its a very physical demanding job, it's a job for a younger person.You need to be able micro manage in the enviroment.Being Conscience and alert and attending to the customers"
Safeway,1dplktjt8b87i802,3.0,The job is great depending on the departments but it’s great to work for if you’re going to school or it’s a first time job. The experience is excellent to become patient and a people person.
Safeway,1dpliptc5b8ba802,2.0,Make more money for as hard as they work you  I feel like I never see my family cause I’m always at work. They don’t care about important things in your life
Safeway,1dpl6smpeb87i802,1.0,"Would be double booked for shifts in different departments.  No common courtesy for the employee.  You are simply a number.  Management tells you what you want to hear, but then goes and does something completely different from your discussions."
Safeway,1dpk5ap2ub8b7801,1.0,"I have worked at two different locations for the past three years. One store as a part time employee and the other as a department manager. Upper management and the company does not care about its employees. 90% of employees are unhappy with their job, how they are treated, how much they are compensated, and how much the company is lacking in decency and respect for its employees. I would not recome to this job or company to anyoneZ do yourself a favor and run while you have the chance"
Safeway,1dpjav370b87f800,5.0,the hours were cut then had us working 24 hours in 5 days a week so left to look for something better. The management didn't care about the hours cuts.
Safeway,1dph24oggh3md802,3.0,working at Safeway is a great way to get into the workforce but in the long run you’ll want to find something more satisfying. Some people might really like it depending on their position and values.
Safeway,1dpfnqppub8b7802,3.0,"A typical day at work is we are understaffed, nothing is ever done when I get into work. I have to pick up the slack of other coworkers. Management is not good. But, despite all of that I still do the best that I can with helping customers, my coworkers and just try to get my job done as well as I can while helping everyone else."
Safeway,1dpeumiva5n93802,4.0,Advancement within the company was great.

Safeway,1dpe9adipbreg808,4.0,"Straight forward, professional atmosphere. It is a nice place to work if you are looking for an easy job with many benefits. There are a lot of positions to fit what you’re looking for."
Safeway,1dpdmgiush3ho802,3.0,Its a great job may be for you may not. Hard work does go a long way with this company. You meet people from all over the world and get treated like family.
Safeway,1dpd7vvkph41o804,4.0,The pay isn't worth the irregular schedule but it is unionized! You end up finishing the last shift work because they are trying to do the previous shift its all behind.
Safeway,1dpbp66bg5n93802,3.0,Productive and fun workplace with in a positive environment. encourage the employee to be productive and professional at all times.  Always understand that the customers are always right.
Safeway,1dpbnettub8al800,1.0,Safeway is by far the worst company to work for. The management team walk around like bullies trying to pick A fight. They schedule you whenever they want and when they feel like cutting your hours back they do. Don’t call in sick even if you have sick time as a benefit they will not pay you or allow you to use your benefits. The only one who benefits is Safeway. Worst management team ever.
Safeway,1dpb8846a5j53802,5.0,A fair schedule that allowed for plenty of things to do to keep busy with nice staff and co-workers that work along side you. Was a basic job that allowed me to learn basic job skills
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dpb77uujbreg802,4.0,"This was my first job, so it was great for teaching me how to navigate the professional world. I learned alot about customer service and how to complete tasks in a tight time frame."
Safeway,1dp9e52rqb838802,1.0,They dont actually care about you. And the manager is terrible They care about making money and that’s it. Work you to death or not at all. Very inconsistent
Safeway,1dp93oj95b8al802,5.0,"Great review, I recommend this company to anyone in need of a job, the atmosphere is friendly and the customers are delightful. I would give them five stars if this was based on a five star rate level."
Safeway,1dp6gq1imbreg802,3.0,It was okay it was my favorite place to work at not nice coworker sometimes I always wished that the higher up people would come down and look at the prices
Safeway,1dp5utsg55j53805,4.0,"The typical day was busy.  I learned to use deli, meat cutting machinery, and how to work in the food service business.  The management was fair.  The hardest part that I found about the job was that, everything that you were expected to do was on a time clock."
Safeway,1dp5lp1j552te802,1.0,"Horrible, aggressive and dangerous work environment. Please don’t do it to yourself. There’s no security and shoplifters might as well live in the store."
Safeway,1dp5193cmb838803,3.0,Let go just before the trial period like the rest of the new hires. Automated check outs took our jobs as well as several long time employees. Mine was to be a part time for as long as I wanted. Nothing said to any of us that it was a Temp job and they knew the automated checkout machines were going in long before we were hired. The manager was great and I had top reviews but his lips were sealed knowing of the up coming lay offs. I have been told he has since left Safeway and works for another company. Part time people got no benefits at all.
Safeway,1dp4o8l5c5j53804,5.0,"Working at Safeway was a great experience for me. I was able to grow within the company and learn new things. Unfortunately, the location I worked at closed but if it hadn't I would definitely still work with them."
Safeway,1dp4nmjr8breg802,2.0,I know have a happy life except the job part. I am eager to start any new opportunity. :) I have been there 23 years. I have held all roles there and I guess they want us older ones :( I have great passion a positive attitude great work ethic and very reliable.
Safeway,1dp469n9eb8al800,3.0,"I liked the people who I worked with but after 3 years on the job, 3 separate requests for a interview for a management position I was fed up. Good staff, bad company."
Safeway,1dp42kj59breg802,3.0,Good position for someone who can work independently. High pressure somewhat due to differing opinions of what is required between store management and district management. Job has become much less about actually selling products then maintaining similar standards between different stores.
Safeway,1dp407glhh45o808,3.0,"As a bakery Clerk, I had a new experience within packaging goods and helping customers with the exact cake they wanted. I learned expiration dates and the correct packaging labels."

Safeway,1dp3gjalhb86v802,3.0,"I used to love working there, but now I hate it. I would have close to 40 hours weekly continued to go down more and more. Only offered about 14 hours at $12 an hour doesnt pay anything."
Safeway,1dp1vo7vtb86v803,2.0,"good starting company, if you want to move up will help you grow in your career if safeway is what you want, very flexible hours and shifts if youre restricted."
Safeway,1dp1vh02bb838802,5.0,I enjoyed working with my associates and meeting new customers daily everyday was a challenge and exciting.  My supervisor was a great person to work for.
Safeway,1dp1ko19bh3ho801,2.0,"If the store manager likes you, you're good. However if the store manager doesn't like you you'll never be good enough. I started under one manager and was liked, respected, challenged, coached , etc. for 2 successful years. When there was change of store managers the difference was incredible to the point I went from working 5-7 days a week to working only 2/3 days. When I questioned it, I was told it was a Safeway decision, though the manager didn't know I had other store managers reach out to me saying they asked to use me in their store and my store manager  told them  ""NO"". Many aspects of the company are very 1970's, 1980's. As long as you can stand the issues like these you'll be fine. Safeway is like other big box retailers that churn, use you up and will spit you out if you let it."
Safeway,1dp0n2ulq5j53800,4.0,The management staff were for the most part fair and friendly. Coworkers were great! Lower level management were awesome! This company is very good at cross training there employees to give them a more diverse skill set. There is also great opportunity for advancement.
Safeway,1dourq65eb832802,2.0,"At the time , I believe they were going through a change of management . Department were low in staff and things were really unorganized. It was like you had to honestly go with the flow of the day ."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1douahp64bre9801,4.0,"Haven't worked in other departments but starbucks can be fun, until you're left alone and have to take orders and make drinks yourself then it is stressful and not worth the money. Hours are wack and resemble the ups and downs of a roller coaster with only split days off regardless of telling management you hate it."
Safeway,1dou4b034b832802,1.0,"Managers are horrible. Nobody carries their weight. Never apply to store 1605. Worked two years there as a night stocker. Unfair wages, unqualified managers, understaffed, no communication between anyone, nobody takes responsibility for anything, everybody is constantly playing the blame game. Lots of drama."
Safeway,1dosu7lbpb832802,4.0,I like people and I try to chat with them and welcome them and give them a smile =)   My co-workers are fun to work with we all try to keep a positive attitude towards our day or night !
Safeway,1dosbb0rnbre9800,3.0,"While working at Safeway, I got a shoulder injury and had to file a claim. A year later, I'm still injured. I had to take leave to try recovering after managers and coworkers got very toxic about my inability to do most things. I had a manager tell me, point-blank, I had to come collect carts even though it was listed I couldn't collect carts in my doctor note. This was a week after being hospitalized for my shoulder injury. Needless to say, I won't be working for Safeway anymore. Without an injury, they're not too bad. It's just a matter of working yourself to the point of wanting to collapse at the end of every shift."
Safeway,1dos2p88qb86l801,3.0,They are many employees but the pay is really not paid as well for all the things we have to do as employees. Other than that they are very flexible as a part time job.
Safeway,1dos23kkmb86l802,1.0,It's a union job that requires you pay fees. Hours are spratic and the raise is depressing. NOT WORTH IT! Also the other workers expect you to do work without any sense of direction or guide when you are new
Safeway,1dorjognhbre9802,2.0,"I worked there for 4 years and not once got any advancement to another department, hours were chaotic and inconsistent. They suck at tending to there employees needs"
Safeway,1dorj1or1b832802,5.0,"I work to grow my self mentally i push it through every obstacle i ever been thru .Safeway was just the beginning  i cant say where it ends , but im hoping u guys could help with my future"
Safeway,1doqbm8qpb86l800,4.0,Es muy rapido el trabajo tienes que ir por carts y empacar y hacer la limpieza de la tienda pero al final tiene muy buen ambiente laboral
Safeway,1doq8jbpnbre9800,4.0,"the work is easy, just laborious, lots of lifting, stocking, and time management. slightly repetitive and rarely fulfilling, but the work environment, people and coworkers, make it all worth it"
Safeway,1doq5oopjb8ai802,4.0,"I started at Safeway 2 years ago as a meat clerk. I gained experience in communications with customers and coworkers, alike. I wrapped meat and took orders for holiday roasts. I had entered the apprenticeship program at one time. I enjoyed the time, and will carry the knowledge with me to future occupations."
Safeway,1dopsu33fb832800,3.0,The culture was great and most of the people i worked with were very polite and cheerful. The only downside was the scheduling was very inconsistent and more often than not requests for certain times off were ignored.
Safeway,1dopkkahfbre9804,3.0,No teamwork no management no consistency no accountability it’s a great job if you are coasting through life no job advancement unless you are favored unbelievable

Safeway,1domn1r2pb8ae803,4.0,The stability and opportunities to rise in the company were outstanding. The flexibility to switch departments and different skills you're taught throughout the jobs are wonderful
Safeway,1dok6toq7bre9805,1.0,"This is not a good place to work . Since the store director left in July of 2019 due to the ASD. That store has fallen apart . The morale of employees was bad  due to the ASD. She was condescending, rude and was always yelling at the employees in front of customers. I think they finally got her out of there after she managed to get rid of some key people."
Safeway,1dok3slq8bre9802,3.0,Great team to work with but lost sleep due to back-to-back shifts constantly. The union gets in the way as well. Will pester you until you join. No consistent scheduling.
Safeway,1doik8mhpb86l802,3.0,there were some days that the work hours were so long that i had to sleep in my car to avoid going home and coming back.
Safeway,1dohqd6dlh3hi802,5.0,The manager that interviewed me was really nice except they did not want to start me at higher pay even though I have more than 7 years experience in management and cashier and that's not okay even though they give raises in  a couple of months afterwards I still need to take care of my family  just because it's a grocery store doesn't mean that they can do that since everybody wants to work there.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.

Safeway,1doherdfebre9800,3.0,Low pay for what you have to deal with.  Some management is great others are not.  Employees are great to work with just ignore the negative talk and focuse on the job.
Safeway,1dofk8utrb86c802,2.0,Horrible company now. Safeway used to care about employees once it sold out took all 90% fulltime employees down to 25hrs which isn't even enought to pay for roof over head.
Safeway,1dof82fclh45a802,4.0,I loved working at Safeway due to the people I worked with. But I wasn’t happy with management not being flexible with my school schedule. But other than that Safeway is great for job opportunity and advancement

Safeway,1doet4nll5n8i802,4.0,I loved working as a teller and customer service clerk for safeway. It always kept me thinking on my feet helping customers. It taught me how to handle a high volume of problems while assuring customers. The friends I made there are some of the best relationships I've had in my life. The only difficult thing is holidays things can get outrageously busy but management does their best to keep employee morale high.
Safeway,1docvgef4b8a6802,1.0,my coworkers were great my management was terrible the company doesn't care about their employees and doesn't believe in paying a fir salary to their workers the only good thing is they are union.
Safeway,1doct7p5vb86c801,4.0,"My typical day at work is checking the cases to pull out all expired cakes/pastries and distress them.  Then I would look at my special orders and get them going.  Once that is done, I'm working on filling the cases based on the needed quantity in the sale report.  If the day start with needing buttercream/custard, I would make those first and label them with date and store them accordingly.  In addition to the routine, I also will have to prep for the following day or making backups so the store is ready for the busy weekend. Before the day is over, I will need to complete report and cleaning my working station."
Safeway,1docoj5ve5j4j802,4.0,"As a checker/cashier, if you do your work correctly and follow policies, nobody bothers you. In other words if you get the job done in accurate manner you are good to go."

Truly and enjoyable organization to work for."
Safeway,1doc9n4erb8a6800,3.0,"Is a good job, but the employees with more time working there feeling like they are the boss, they don’t respect you and the managers don’t do nothing."
Safeway,1doc9hat5b86c802,5.0,"It was fast paced and enjoyable. Though some employees didn't like their jobs, i tried to keep a positive attitude because it was actually really nice working there.

Safeway,1doc8fblrh3ll808,1.0,I enjoyed the customers and working with the coworkers. Fun place to work. The hours worked perfectly as a part time job around my full time position.
Safeway,1doadhtvsb8a6802,2.0,The Good:  If you had no education and you wanted to make a career of working at a grocery store you could do that even if you were not the slightest bit intelligent.  You had maximum benefits and the ability to work hard and work your way up the pay scale and job title.  and paid vacation if you work there long enough.  The jobs you performed were easy.
Safeway,1doa9fjrsb8a6802,2.0,"They were inconsistent in how giving shifts, giving me hours on times of the day where I needed to be class even when I told them why I couldn't work those days."
Safeway,1doa3i099b82n802,1.0,"Management didn’t care about the people. They only cared about what you haven’t gotten done by the time they come over and check up on you which was very rare. Management only cares about their look rather then quality. They only care about getting a customer in and out, rather then asking them how’s their day going. It really made my time working at Safeway miserable."
Safeway,1do9oc9t9bre0800,1.0,"We had a grand opening a week before Christmas and had vendors in and out of the department making a mess. None of them cleaned up after themselves. My store manager decided to give one of my two closers the entire week off. Also, they trained everyone a month before opening, only for a week. Then didn’t train them again, and expected me to train them opening week in between all of my other duties. I didn’t have a day off while I worked there and worked 44 hours the first three days."
Safeway,1do91cjjdb86c802,4.0,"Many challenges working with many different people,   dealing with grumpy. Rude customers and their rude remarks and demands, them getting upset because we are out of a product. Very annoying at times, but then seeing our regular friendly customers to brighten our day."

Safeway,1do7iql4dbrdt802,4.0,Good company to work. I've been shown alot and was able to apply the skills I learned from foods co. Hard to maintain good workers due to management changes.
Safeway,1do75jjkrb867802,5.0,"It was a great work experience, some days were more busy than other and you just had to stay calm and work hard. The best part of working there was working with a friend, getting our job done and being able to laugh and enjoy it was amazing."
Safeway,1do73bs3ch3h7801,4.0,Great environment great people and best chance of climbing the corporate ladder. Training was finominal and the management was very enthused to help at every turn.
Safeway,1do47t2690mcn002,3.0,"at Safeway I've learned to work in almost every department but only received a pay raise when the minimum wage went up, some managers are fair and decent, the job its self isn't stressful too much but the hours are completely random and leaves you barely any room for outside life. other employees there are wonderful people and hard workers but the best thing I've gotten from working there for two years are getting to know the people who I've worked with and the experience of working in all the departments"
Safeway,1do3hepccb867800,4.0,"working at Safeway the typical workday is clocking in, checking on the carts, looking at the bathrooms, keeping up on cleaning, and making sure that you are able to help others."
Safeway,1do2131m9b867804,3.0,"My initial manger was great but when she left we didnt have anyone for weeks. I was new at the store and had to figure out how to manage inventory on my own and it made things really difficult because I wasnt even getting paid for all the extra work I was doing. When the new manager came in, I tried explaining to her how things were going and she was rude and careless."
Safeway,1do1thmb3h417802,5.0,There. Ok. To work for  their manger are. Very bad. And don't care about there worker at all but they employees are there for eachother and do the best they can
Safeway,1do042ufob82i802,3.0,A typical day was to be on the registrar and begin ringing up customers. Learned how to run a registrar and bag groceries and pricing.The Manager that was in charge was never available and seemed to always be stressed out. (He is no longer there) Otherwise the other people were great. The Customer service agents had poor customer service skills and were not too nice. The workplace culture was not very inclusive of other new people. The hardest part was having a non-supportive manager. The most enjoyable was that most of the team members had good spirit and were fun to work with.
Safeway,1dnvsflb1b82i804,3.0,"I would not work in this type of retail job, I worked at the one on Mission and France next to a former funeral home in San Francisco, and the employee`s are great except for the management who likes to disrespect their employees by bullying and harassing them non-stop, and they are rude to the customers and racial profile them as well. But management always get moved to other stores very often you have to start all over every time, every manager wants things to be done in a different way"
Safeway,1dnvs8kduh417802,1.0,"I expected to work full time, but instead I would get 20 hours or less per week.  After a year I could qualify to get benefits.   It was Union and I had to pay my dues each paycheck.   The manager was pushy bossy arrogant and intimidating.  Sometimes she would berate employees in front of customers"
Safeway,1dnvqb83eb867802,3.0,"I was a barista at a Starbucks kiosk within Safeway, but I was technically a Safeway employee.  Fun environment where associates felt like a little family, and hours were very flexible for each department as long as you were under full time.  The pay and benefits were bare minimum however - ""competitive pay"" is translated to mean as little as they can legally get away with giving you."
Safeway,1dnvobnagb82i801,3.0,Overall working at Safeway has been great. The people are amazing and it’s very clean work space. However I find myself feeling like I do more work that what I get paid for. They will take as much as you’re willing to give them.
Safeway,1dnvf6sm7b82i808,3.0,I was opening checker at 5 am. I loved being a checker there and all of the customers. I also enjoyed working in the floral department on the managers vacation days.
Safeway,1dnv8s8plb867805,4.0,All in all Safeway was a great first company to work for but over the years I was admired and needed so much in my department that there wasn't any room for growth in the store for me. I never got the full store experience I wanted in the workplace.
Safeway,1dntvj005b8a0800,5.0,really great job to have wished they paid more though but still a pretty fun job my experience with Safeway was cool but every location is different but definitely give it a try you might like!!! (;

Safeway,1dnsinv8jh453804,4.0,Everyone who works here has been here for a long time. If you are interested in growth opportunities there are not many. I would recommend if you want something stable.
Safeway,1dnqfijfmb89r802,3.0,"If it was a slow day I learned to remain occupied. If it was a busy day it wasn't fair to be understaffed and difficulty learning computer system. Enjoyed learning how to make balloon bouquets, floral arrangements and also sometimes to my own liking."
Safeway,1dnqfcujdh413807,1.0,I hadn’t the slightest clue what was in store!! I was hired the same day I turned my application in and was told I was a great fit for the position. Come to find out anybody was a great fit at that time because they were in dire need of HELP!! So the position required you to do your job and the next persons because they’d hire anything breathing instead of qualified persons! Don’t bother applying unless your willing to give up your soul!
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dnqe6dt5b89r802,3.0,"The employees are great people, i would recommend to work there for the benefits and help they provide. I will say it can be a struggle at time due to scheduling or understaffed departments. But overall a good job to get experience from."
Safeway,1dnqa1146h3h3802,3.0,Very unprofessional Management. Treat employees as if they are expendable I would never chose to work at another safeway or any other grocery store because of my experience
Safeway,1dnq90ht1b82b800,3.0,"Safeway is a fast pace work place, they dont like over time or raises, they laid me off after I had mouth surgery and asked for days off cause I couldnt come in on prescribed pain pills and antibiotics to prevent me from getting an infection in my mouth. they cut my hours completely after my surgery."
Safeway,1dnq2bm0qh3le802,3.0,No advancement opportunities.

Safeway,1dnojgj66brdo802,3.0,"Safeway is a nice place to work at. Typically there is usually a lot one has to do at the store and depending on which department you work in. I have learned to deal with all sorts of customers with the request they have as well as questions they ask. The most enjoyable part of working there is the interactions with the customers because you tend to meet many different people from all walks of life, same with coworkers you end up working with a lot of different people with different backgrounds and you tend to come together and help each other out."
Safeway,1dnnrkm7obrdo802,1.0,"Low salary, poor management, other employees didn't do their jobs, depressing, unsanitary, understaffed, staff was generally not polite to customers, overall bad experience"

Safeway,1dnn6nkue52vu800,5.0,"Working at Safeway was very beneficial to me because of the flexible hours and hourly pay. While working there it keeps you busy and teaches you to have great customer service skills from dealing with various cultures of people and their attitudes. The hardest part of the job I would say is keeping time management, you have to adequately and efficiently get customers through your line at a satisfactory rate. The great thing about working at Safeway is the environment and the people, they keep a positive environment and helpful when needed."
Safeway,1dnmq99f7brdo804,4.0,"Really busy, especially for the holidays.  At the same time, I had a lot of fun here.  I was able to really expand my skill set and collaborate with customers to bring their dream desserts to life."

Safeway,1dnm8ktvnh3h3802,1.0,It doesn't seem like the company cares about its employees. I like the people I work with but they seem to want me to put my life on hold for them....
Safeway,1dnm48lkbb82b802,3.0,As a bookkeeper there is a lot of work and in the middle of trying to do it all your being called to check for only 12.20 an hour.Its a big possision to fill alot to pack into a shift
Safeway,1dnln15rm0mtg000,5.0,"Very easy job to do. help customers, carry outs, collect carts, sweep, work in different departments. Bagging, discounts, uniforms, great people to work with."
Safeway,1dnj8bdtm0mci001,2.0,"The store manager did a terrible job at creating a healthy team environment. She was not encouraging but instead put people down when her day wasn’t going  well and it rubbed off on everyone in the store. Nobody liked being there, most of the responsibilities were put on the lowest paid staff. It was very negative. I’d rather be broke than work at Safeway again."
Safeway,1dnhjo5ahb861802,5.0,Never give any attitude towards costumers always help them out be friendly to them as if there ur friends.
Safeway,1dnhe2mo9b89r802,1.0,Terrible managment. The managment gets bonus's for saving the co. Money. So they will cut your hours every chance they can. Your dept. Will always be short staffed so when you do work you will work your butt off. They also change your time in the time clock and erase your o.t.
Safeway,1dnh95c96b82b802,5.0,"I really liked working for Vons and Pavilions. The people there are great, the environment was really amazing in the company. The management is also amazing and the managers were always there for the workers support."
Safeway,1dngqtverb89r802,1.0,"Glad I left when I did. It was good at first but got too hectic and it seemed like my boss stopped caring after a while. The pay was terrible, not worth the stress and the discount was a joke."

Safeway,1dngc0hhnh3le802,1.0,This job will suck the life out of you. The pay is not equivalent to the amount of work and effort required. Management changes every 3 months and most don’t even learn your name most of the time. Worst 5 years of my life. Lots of people have to drink just to be able to do the job...don’t waist your life!!
Safeway,1dngaofd10mci004,1.0,"Enter at ur own risk😊. Safeway is a company that will use you until your soul is gone, pretend they care then squeeze you to see if anything else comes out. While under paying,  over working , and demeaning you. Good luck."
Safeway,1dng39vubh3p2802,4.0,"The customers are easy to talk to and are understanding, the employees are awesome, they help you with what u ever need and they help brighten the mood, if you need anything they will be there for you. it's easy to take the trash out bc u can a cart to gather it all and they have latex free gloves if you are allergic to latex. They pay attention to your health issues and what you are allergic to."
Safeway,1dnfv70dnb861802,4.0,My particular store didn’t pay very much mind to my school schedule so I was working 40 hours a week as a high school student.
Safeway,1dnfik66eh3le802,4.0,"After clocking in, I'd check the promo shelves and prepared to restock and cook for dinner rush. Typically roasting chickens, prep sandwich bar, drop fryers and refill displays. We had regulars that dropped in and knew what to expect. I needed to be prepared for travelers and students depending on the season. Coworkers were worth it too. No regrets working in the deli; never thought I'd enjoy it, but with the right mind set, it was a good stepping stone and made friends while there who still keep in touch. It was worth every minute."
Safeway,1dne7a6gqb861800,1.0,They were always understaffed and not getting breaks on time. Always had to bag own groceries while checking and always at the checkstand busy with mad customers because of the lines.

Safeway,1dndoc500b89r803,3.0,"Good for experience and flexible hours (mostly). Management is in and out. Disrespect is popular among management. Steady hours are a benefit, but he pay is too little."
Safeway,1dnbtd62qb82a802,3.0,Worst job I was so bored good place to shop nice people nice workers wut ever I just like money they didn't pay much took too long to move up in there
Safeway,1dnbqig4qh3h2802,1.0,I worked for this place for 10 years doing all the extras . Stepping into the operational specialist roll when asked . Never got paid corporate pay. Was sent to may stores to help with other departments and never got any kind of appreciation or compensation. You will be relocated against your will no matter what your situation is. Don't expect for this company to work around any thing in your life cause it won't happen. They don't care if you have kids go to college get sick anything.  They will over work you and you will NEVER get a raise at all. They will use you as long as you let them and if you ask for a raise or complain to corporate they will find a way to push you out. They invade your privacy monitor all your social media take screen shots of any posts they can hold against you even if has nothing to do with the company. Beware don't work for this place.
Safeway,1dnb2t2g2b82a800,5.0,"This a grocery store some days it was slow but some were fast . The begging of the Month wa my favorite because the store is packed from morning to night and you get to meet and greet new customer, old customers. Like this job was fun to me"
Safeway,1dnav49osb860800,3.0,"I had a great time at work picking up the responsibilities of cleaning that no one else has gotten the time to do, it gave me great pride to be able to help my store provide a cleaner,more sanitary dining and buying experience. Unfortunately since I worked at night past closing hours, there  had been a constant miscommunication with my start time. I was in college at the time so I took the opportunity to resign from safeway and pursue the full time student responsibilities."
Safeway,1dnaa8md6brdn800,5.0,Work was easy just have to be fast paste. My manager wasnt a good manager. But coworkers are there to help. Money is good. Great benefits. Hope to come back

Safeway,1dn8jb57eh412805,2.0,Extremely boring job. Coworkers were nice but the management was abysmal. Constantly on my back even though the store was rarely occupied. They were also extremely fake to the employees.
Safeway,1dn8cahbrbrdn802,4.0,Safeway has benefits to offer. Management is great and the people is great. A great place to get work experience and advancement. Lots of work areas to apply within the company. Safeway works with its personnel to provide a better work environment and opportunities

Safeway,1dn6gvc8mb85v802,2.0,"I’ve worked for this company for over 10 years and they aren’t treating me as if I matter. My wage has been frozen since I entered pharmacy school and I keep getting told that I’ll get a raise at this point or that point and nothing has happened, they keep changing when I am “due” for a raise, despite the fact that technicians that have been with the company less time than I have been are Now making more than I am. I would expect a little better treatment for long standing employees especially when they’re furthering their education and can become an asset to the company."

Safeway,1dn2su9qph411800,3.0,Me and the store manager did not get along from day 1. Got along with most the crew and management but felt singled out by the store manager. Felt trapped in my register as he constantly got after me for doing things that other checkers would do.

Safeway,1dmttbn92h411800,1.0,"The management at the store was good, however the high up the management chain you went the worse it was. They do not care about their employees. They see their employees as an ID number not actual people. They have no forgiveness and are the worst company I have ever worked for."
Safeway,1dmse2afc5nfu801,4.0,The place was very fast paced but sometimes too much. They would make courtesy clerks go out to push carts for an hour at 100+ degree weathers and makes them go in the low degrees while it’s raining and isn’t fair at all.

Safeway,1dms36d45b85v802,2.0,This is a good job first job. This job is not one that could support a family. The hours are unreliable. The shifts are unreliable. The management has their hands tied on most things. Management tends to side with the customer over their employees.
Safeway,1dms0f8kjbrdm808,1.0,The manager was very prejudice against her on kind. She would be late all the time. Then question and wrote up other employees when they were late. Never trained us properly. She always came to work with an attitude.
Safeway,1dmro64fnb828802,4.0,"Stocking at Safeway is a good job, the functions of the job are easy enough to get done in a timely matter,  but when the shift hours change allot and the store switches the management you lose the foundation an everything becomes Unorganized."

Safeway,1dmr2qsb6h3lc802,3.0,"A typical day at Safeway included serving customers, processing orders, weighing food, stocking and restocking display cases, and cleaning the department. The best part of this job was meeting new people and learning different cultures in terms of what they eat and how they prepare food. The hardest part of the job was at the end of the day when things seemed to slow down. I prefer to have a busy day."

Safeway,1dmomd5k7b85r802,4.0,"For the last 5 years I was able to move up in the company fast; My location is very fast paced, busy, and the only grocery store within a small radius. My manager is fantastic! He's kind, caring, giving, and understanding. On the flip side he has so many tasks to do himself it is sometimes hard to get his undivided attention. My location also has a hard time hiring people due to the shortage of hours and wages for new employee's. My days are usually filled with multiple duties; including stocking product, ordering, customer service center, cashiering, display making and proper signage, as well supervising fellow employees. I love my job for the everyday challenges that corporate springs on us and being in a small community you feel the love and support we have not only from the town but also from the city, police, and neighboring businesses."

Safeway,1dmmqn2sob89m800,1.0,"At this job I barely got any hours and didn't get paid enough to afford the union costs. The reason for my lack of hours is because of ""seniority"". I would not recommend this as your first job, or any job at that."

Safeway,1dmhmmdmkb81j800,2.0,"My employment with Safeway electric was full of competitiveness for a better position that does not exist, they will work you like a slave, than lay you off, they're all family and friends which makes it difficult to feel comfortable, also the language barrier was terrible and made me feel as though they were saying things behind my back."

Safeway,1dmgp2b27h3gr802,1.0,The store director operated as a boss and not a leader. No team spirit but quick to blame and reprimand. She was condescending and rude in person but acted charming when upper management came into the store. The store environment was everyone for themselves because of the way the Director led the store.
Safeway,1dmeurmq6h44r800,1.0,"not a good place to work, no communication there , store manager only thinks of her self.to much stress on a daily basis, Store manager has her favorite people ."
Safeway,1dmeolscgb89i800,5.0,I enjoyed the questions.  I am a member of ufcwlocal7. Denver Division.  I worked as a caddy a checker and a produce clerk.  I like taking care of fresh fruit and vegetables!
Safeway,1dmebs5n5b85m802,1.0,"It's high school with all the clicks, I was a gm management and I was wrkng 50+ hrs a week I we're just so much I actually was taken from Safeway by ambulance and found I was suffering from over-exhaustion and spent 3 days in the hospital and one week off of work when I return to work they had given my position away I thought that was very unfair very rude and definitely Mary they walked around with noses in the air . Had huge egos over their jobs you're not better than anyone else"
Safeway,1dmcndg7uh3oq804,5.0,"Overall good experience i wouldnt mind working there again, supplied me with a great amount off wok hours as well, seafood was a hard but useful  learning experience."
Safeway,1dmclinonb89i802,5.0,Safeway was a great starting point in my pharmacy career. My position was very rewarding helping customers with all of their pharmacy needs and able help problem solve with insurance needs.
Safeway,1dmcb873kbrdg800,3.0,My store always lacked workers and management wasn't the best.
Safeway,1dmbkvp7lb89i802,3.0,"Pharmacy was okay, the atmosphere was sufficient. There was no program training, making it difficult to guess at the computer. Most of the workers with the exception of two were not helpful on passing on what they knew and maintained negative attitudes to anyone new."
Safeway,1dmaptig5brdg800,3.0,This job helped prepare me for my jobs to come. It helped me see both good work and examples of what not to do. The management cared a lot. Safeway was fun.
Safeway,1dmaioauabrdg800,2.0,Vons gave me an incredibly good work ethic that I still have to this day. Management was always the issue with most stores and they never really allowed me to move up even tho I made record sales.
Safeway,1dmac1l2sb89i800,3.0,Its hard and they don't know how to treat there employees. I started out as a bagger then in the bakery which was good then they didn't even ask me but they moved me to the deli.
Safeway,1dm9d0b66h3kq800,4.0,fast paced and stressful environment
Safeway,1dm7oh1ceb85m800,3.0,The best part of the job is your fellow employees. They share the good times and the hardships with you.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dm7d9gsrbrdg802,2.0,"Long Hrs, over worked, high stress environment. Think twice before taking a position here. Pay is on the lower end. When you count the hrs worked vs pay you work for just a few dollars an hr."
Safeway,1dm74rr6fbrdg804,2.0,In the short time I worked there in one year the store went through eight managers. No consistency in the direction of employees with no consistent management.
Safeway,1dm74kvath3sq805,3.0,"Would recommend if you're looking for an easy job. Friendly coworkers, typically a nice environment. Enjoyed meeting new people everyday as well as seeing coworkers."
Safeway,1dm73a4c5b81j806,2.0,I thought Safeway was not giving enough hours out to people that was not enough for some of the live off on. Me personally it was very rough and i commuted to Poulsbo.
Safeway,1dm6r5c5sb85m801,5.0,Safeway was one of the best places I could have worked but I'm ready to find myself and my career and where it goes I can say nothing bad about Safeway
Safeway,1dm525gcnbrdc800,1.0,Had to quit my job as a courtesy clerk I  this store because this verbally and mentally abusive manager sent me to the emergency room. Had to quit because the HR is so desperate to keep this woman in no matter how many times employees AND customers complained about her. She has a reputation in the hometown for being a nasty and unpleasant individual.
Safeway,1dm4qb5c75n9n802,3.0,"Wouldn't recommend working here. More work, more stress, less pay. It's not worth the time nor money to even consider working here. Management tries to help as much as they can with problems but the whole operations is generally messed up."
Safeway,1dm4q42t4h3om800,2.0,Some people at Safeway are the most rude an incompetent people I've ever met with low standards of who works there. Management was not the best to some others that work there only a handful of people were actually genuinely amazing happy
Safeway,1dm4hqh4sb81f802,5.0,Very busy at safeway. Definitely not a job for everybody but it is a good environment to be in and you meet lots of people while you're working . You have to stay on top of your work tho cause it is easy to get side tracked somebody's is always asking you questions and asking you to do things
Safeway,1dm44uda8h44n800,5.0,"Safeway is a place we resort to for any/all necessities we find use for, co-workers were helpful  and knowledgeable- the bus I rode to and from work made transportation a bit difficult, one reason I chose to go to another job - actually enjoyed making and baking cookies and such and hearing from customers how much they appreciate them"
Safeway,1dm3kn4ojh40l802,4.0,Safeway is a good starting job and for the few that can handle management have a great opportunity for advancement. I would recommend this job to anyone young or otherwise.
Safeway,1dm2rub40b81f800,2.0,Sucks. No one is really happy to be working there. Upper management is always trying to find someone to push the blame on. They rather replace you than pay you more.
Safeway,1dm1upi1th3km802,1.0,Just at the 6500 piney branch rd Nw is horrid and management should be fired immeadiatly I wouldn’t recommend anyone going to work at that location especially in the nasty produce dept
Safeway,1dm1q493nb81f801,3.0,"I worked at Safeway for a summer because they didn't have enough employees in the small town I lived in. They offered an hourly higher than what I was being paid at my other part time job, so I joined on. There are plenty of job advancement opportunities for anyone who is willing to stick with their job and work hard."
Safeway,1dm1nhsj3b85i801,5.0,Most people were welcoming and helpful when it came to the learning process. I had a few bumps here and there with other employees but management was really good at helping with things!
Safeway,1dm1chb2ubrdc800,2.0,"Typical grocery job, though my manager was keen to use me, a mother of a small child, as a way to fill in the holes in her scheduling.This thankfully ended and I was put onto a regular scheduled when I confronted her."
Safeway,1dm0uskd9b81f800,1.0,"I hated working at Safeway it is a very stressful environment they Do NOT and I repeat They DO NOT care about their employees the Director is demanding verbally and emotionally abusive,  the upper Managers do nothing about it  they are Racist , they consistently break the law by not giving you 10 min breaks you barely are  allowed to  use the bathroom and poor training .There is no room for advancement , it is a dead end job your wasting your time"
Safeway,1dm0clkt1b85h800,3.0,Corporate is shady. They don't want to pay any employees that works hard they just want to keep a revolving door. They do not care about employees that have pride in there work
Safeway,1dm09rojrbrdb801,4.0,"I worked in the bakery area for the rest of my employment at Safeway. The hardest part was dealing and working with my manager at the time. Also hours, I got enough..having to be there at 5am was sometimes rough."
Safeway,1dm0653ieh3gl800,4.0,It's an easy job for decent pay. Good health insurance opportunities. They give good training the hours are pretty inconsistent though which can be rough.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dm058k8fb85h800,4.0,"I worked graveyard shift so I don't know how daytime or swing was like. Every shift there is vastly different. Was some drama at the main store but I was at the gas station. Winter time sucks working out there, especially at night"
Safeway,1dlvv8vdk5j5i800,5.0,"Georgetown, DC Safeway is called nice place to work. Staffs members are more friendly, respectable to their colleagues,they makecustomers comfortable."
Safeway,1dlst3lgob88n804,4.0,i like working at safeway i just need more money than im being paid right now and i also feel singled out because i can not do as much as my co workers.
Safeway,1dlsepu3pb84p806,1.0,"I work part time as a cashier at Safeway, I’m a new hire since so many people quit. They gave me a total of 30 hours in 3 days, with barely any training. I have no time for a personal life anymore since I do things on the weekends since they require you to work weekends. It’s not fair to give someone 30 hours in 3 days of working with barely any experience."
Safeway,1dlq46838brck800,5.0,"This by far was my favorite job. Very simple and pleasant. The staff I had the pleasure of working with was great. Holidays were a little tough as is any job. I would have stayed if they had been willing at the time to give me a slight pay raise for the higher department and job positions I was doing at the time. However, still highly recommend."
Safeway,1dlovpu56b88n800,4.0,"Safeway is a good place for the individual seeking work early on in their professional life. My experience with the work load and management have been positive, as have been my experiences with fellow employees and the overall culture of the company. The only major downside is that you will be given a rather chaotic schedule if you're just starting out, and shouldn't expect to work more than 20 hours a week. Anticipate to work disparate shifts, such as the early morning day, and closing for the next day you're scheduled."
Safeway,1dlon1atnb80l800,3.0,Safeway is full of customers who are either tired or just mean. Safeway should be a job for you if you need one desperately. Although I like the weekly payment.
Safeway,1dlogfrr4b84p806,4.0,Excellent place of employment for full students. Also a great 2nd job for part time work. Safeway is very flexible and will work around your schedule and availability.
Safeway,1dlo0sjkdb84p802,4.0,"Working at safeway is one of the best ways to introduce someone into the working world.  As it was my first job, the staff was very team oriented and most of my coworkers were very helpful and caring.  From helping with tasks I didn't know I didn't know how to handle, to helping with understanding the benfits the job comes with as well."
Safeway,1dlns2q2obrck800,5.0,I enjoyed working at Safeway 1661 it was always a pleasure. I enjoyed all management and supervisors. When my husband has surgery and gets better I plan on reapplying for my job back at Safeway.
Safeway,1dlnb27kpb88n801,3.0,"I've worked with the company for nearly 7 years in the bakery department as a clerk. After two years, I was eventually promoted to Head Clerk in this department."
Safeway,1dln8bv6pb84p800,2.0,"They need better pay and fare pay, better work environment , and drug test for hard drugs like meth , better security to much riff Raff in the store always someone in there on drugs or doing drugs in the bathrooms and employee bathrooms the bathroom their is really gross."
Safeway,1dln5qqpmbrck801,5.0,"There is always good and bad about any company,  same for Safeway.  The employee are great to work with.  Management has changed over the years. I believe for the better. It is hard work and customer s can be ruthless.  Some are great a d understanding  but you always get a few that really don't know how to treat people.  Management supports you when needed."
Safeway,1dlm9dopibrck800,3.0,Great job 1st job. Entry level to customer service. The job is very fast paced. The day seems to fly by. The management is very concern about sales causing them to push you more.
Safeway,1dllnmqneb80l802,2.0,I was with this company 10 yrs before getting layed off just cause the mangsr of the store didnt like me i did my job infact i did three peoples job every day witxh isnt fair
Safeway,1dlledoct5j50800,4.0,fast paced work enviroment very friendly co workers and management . management was very understanding if you needed to switch a shift with someone. Every day was an adventure
Safeway,1dllajirg5j50809,3.0,"It’s a good starter job, or if you intend to move up, they pay well the higher you go. But at the cost of long hours and stress filled days."
Safeway,1dlkotgkrh3sh805,5.0,"I really enjoyed working for Safeway, but their expectations of me were overwhelming. When they were short on help they expected me to try and pitch in and help out as much as I can and at the same time still keep up my current department responsibilities up as best as I possibly can. It became counter productive when it started to affect my health in the process"
Safeway,1dlklvuel5nd3802,3.0,On the other hand if your young and you stick it out you could make it a career. If you stay find a department you like and learn all about it.
Safeway,1dljth5dab88n802,4.0,Good fair store to work for  management us nice hardworking and will train if your willing to work...... fastpaste  and out gong lady willing to learn anything
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dlipgpc824fs001,1.0,"Managers yelled at employees in front of customers and were very demeaning. If you approached them for anything they didn’t like they cut your hours. Sometimes no hours at all. If you get hurt on the job don’t expect them to pay. They use their doctors for exams and won’t use the report from a personal doctor. They call you the day after your injury to come work even if it’s just greeting customer because if you don’t they will be fined $20,000.  They do not take care of their employees at all! Stay away from this place and any of their other brands at all cost!!"
Safeway,1dlid79f024ec007,3.0,"I have been with Safeway for five years. I would consider myself an above-average employee and have only been promoted once. I have heard multiple times about people not getting promotions or raises they were promised by management. My store is in a nicer area so customers are usually nice and pleasant to deal with. I like almost every person I work with too. You will not get paid much above minimum wage regardless of when you started. However, it is a better environment than fast food. Health benefits are available. Do not count on competitive pay as advertised by the company, it is not true. I would say if you do your job well you will get hours. Schedules change a lot though."
Safeway,1dlftg6s2b88g800,2.0,I would recommend working elsewhere. It takes months if not years to move up. I was an employee for almost 2 years and I got treated terribly. Would recommend not working here.
Safeway,1dlesteoub88g800,4.0,"safeway is union so that's where it's main flaws lie. it makes it extremely difficult to let a bad employee go. because of that, a lot of the good workers get burnt out too quick."
Safeway,1dle99f9lb88g805,5.0,"It is very productive working there, being able to have interaction with many people and helping them is amazing. Working in Safeway, helped me recognize the benefits it gave to all different people and opened its doors to those disabled."
Safeway,1dle6j3n21fdu000,1.0,The Safeway on market is the safeway that needs to be closed immediately. Yeah you get a paycheck.  But you can also get stabbed in the parking lot. Yeah its union which is great unless youre at Safeway where the managers lie through their teeth to cover their self.  Dont get hurt on the clock there.  Trust me on that one. If they didnt treat me like garbage  and try to trick me out of workers comp.
Safeway,1dle4tftj1fdu000,5.0,Co-workers are great and you have opportunities for getting experience in different departments as well as discounts on purchases while on and off the clock
Safeway,1dldmlr74b84i802,2.0,Terrible company to work for. I had health issues. They promised to work with me yet continued to schedule me the hardest shifts and full time even though I wasnt physically able to.
Safeway,1dlcvabat1fdu004,4.0,I have made a friendships with many of my customers. I firmly believe that they make our pay check so with out them I am broke. So I do my best every day to give 100% to my customers. I am responsible for a lot of things like writing and putting away loads. Writing a schedules that fits everyone's needs. The hardest part of my job is pleasing everyone. Sometimes that is just not a doable thing. Hardest part of my job is keeping people that can handle the slow periods of the off season.
Safeway,1dlb1sr0s1fdu000,1.0,Just look forward to being considered nothing. Coworkers are not happy and they change management every year so you will never have a clear example of what to do.
Safeway,1dlb0aqf524et002,3.0,"A Typical day at work would be operating a cash register to accurately ring up our customers' grocery orders.  tendering multiple forms of payment while ensuring our customers experience a friendly, efficient checkout process.  Interacting with a high-volume of customers in a fast-paced environment ensuring that all of their grocery shopping needs were met."
Safeway,1dlamrolpb88g802,3.0,"If it's a quick job you need its perfect.  Tops out at 21.00 per hour for supervisor,  can't go any hire than that unless you get into assistant manager which is still difficult to obtain . Because of merge with Albertsons it's more stressful and demands more out of the employees."
Safeway,1dlajioef24gt002,1.0,"Employee who have been there longer than 10 years have the tendency to gossip, spread lies to get ahead in there work place. Lack of training meaning the show you once and tell you your ready and get mad when you ask questions."
Safeway,1dl9j4na51d0e000,5.0,"Everyone was very helpful i had a lot of fun working there , easy to get to pay was great flexible hours busy a lot to do never get bored meeting new."
Safeway,1dl9f2o3d5j4k802,3.0,"I enjoyed the experience, workers,  and customer relations. I was able to learn more about this industry and how it operates.  I advise against taking my opinion. Seek your own."
Safeway,1dl9bee6q1d0e000,3.0,"I only worked for 3 months there. My store manager did not seem to care about my mental health. I asked for shorter shifts and received 6 days in a row, over my finals, with 9 hour work days. No thank you. I dipped."
Safeway,1dl97cg0024gt000,4.0,Fun workplace but the store needs security bad. Been there for a year and it is not bad you get overtime when it is the holidays. Sometimes a little to much. Over all cool company to work for
Safeway,1dl91du05b88g800,5.0,"It's a good place to work, with great benefits; but I feel the management could be better. The most difficult thing for me was knowing who came first."
Safeway,1dl805nkb24fs000,2.0,"I was often asked to work overtime with no warning and guilted into doing so. The hours were awful, the store was dirty, and the managers were all very rude. Definitely more interested in money than they are in the employees."
Safeway,1dl7lpfn7b88g802,3.0,"I was no impressed with the management team. But, Safeway as a company has plenty of of opportunities to move and cross train between departments to expand your skill set."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dl6nd8vj1d0e002,1.0,if Your a man your fine if your a woman you will be treated not the greatest.
Safeway,1dl61ras224gn002,4.0,I loved working for Safeway. I loved the all most everything about that job. I was on my feet a lot  but I met a lot of people. some managers were good and some were not so good.
Safeway,1dl5imaeq1d08002,4.0,"Management kind of has their own way of doing things. I believe I don’t get paid enough for all of the duties I perform. Days are busy, but there are some times where it’s slow."
Safeway,1dl5eb1ce1d08002,2.0,"Safeway, as a company, can be a good starter job to go with. However, the hours are inconsistent and inflexible, and it will consume most of your time. I cannot with a good conscience recommend this place. There's very little time for you and a lot more time for the company, and due to it's change to Albertsons ownership I especially wouldn't work there if I were you. It is a hostile work environment, at best."
Safeway,1dl44kush1d0r000,4.0,"I started as a courtesy clerk then about two weeks later they promoted me up to the customer service desk, then to day stocking, then around a month I was learning how to run the store help the managers out when needed"
Safeway,1dl37pg871fdo000,3.0,Being a checker at Safeway taught me a great many things to advance my already seasoned customer service background. I really like the people I work with.
Safeway,1dl34h2u71d0r004,3.0,"No room for advancement, delayed and misleading benefits, no set schedule and making under state minimum wage because of Union dues."
Safeway,1dl32ellq1d0r001,3.0,Good job for starting out with decent benefits and a flexible schedule. Pay is lackluster in the long term and opportunities for advancement are thin.
Safeway,1dl2j17hi1fdo000,1.0,Just don't... I'm telling you. For your benefit... Do not work for Safeway or any grocery stores. Management surprised me that they were so bad. The hours were terrible.
Safeway,1dl2ga15u24e6000,5.0,I really enjoyed this job. I left because of a better job opportunity. I was working here while in college and I would say it's a great place to work part time for anyone in school.
Safeway,1dl17m8bt1fdi002,5.0,This can be one of the best and one of the worst places to work depending on what dept you're in.  I don't recommend Deli. That was a joke. Customer Service Booth and Floral are amazing though.
Safeway,1dl0i9dsq1d01000,5.0,I love working at Safeway I am just looking for other jobs because I only get paid $11 an hour and I need more than that to afford an apartment and to pay for my college tuition.
Safeway,1dl099u7c1d11000,3.0,"While I enjoyed working with customers and coworkers, management was not very accommodating and at times downright rude. I have a physical disability and was refused requests for shorter shifts, or to be moved to self checkout where there is more room to move than at a checkstand. My coworkers were understanding of my issues, but I could tell that management did not like to deal with me."
Safeway,1dl05f7rh1d01000,3.0,The work was very stressful and was not rewarding. Management was hard on the worker when it was not necessary and people would get in trouble for the little things.
Safeway,1dkvt3a5m1fdi000,3.0,The people you work with are great. I needed a job after the market crashed in 2008 and I had just gotten out of college. Was hard to leave with benefits and what I thought was a good place to move up.
Safeway,1dkubmpso1d01001,3.0,"Management would constantly change the schedule only a day or two before a shift you were working, they would say the schedule said one thing when it clearly didn't or they would change it without you knowing so you wouldn't show up for a shift you didn't have and then they would get upset at you, they also put you on different jobs that you don't usually do and have no training with without telling you or asking you. this was my experience at Safeway, but overall it wasn't terrible in the beginning, it just definitely went downhill in my time there and i know i wasn't the only one who wasn't happy with the way things were going."
Safeway,1dktr5iul1d01002,2.0,Safeway doesnt really care about the employees. I would work double shifts to cover for someone who called in. Sometimes I would work more than 12 hour days. As soon as I needed some time off for medical reasons i started losing hours.
Safeway,1dkrvbj8v1d0h004,3.0,"lots of work and not enough time to get it all done. in the deli you make sandwiches, salads, do freight, cook, dishes and anything else that needs done.  Great team of workers in the deli and everyone gets along good."
Safeway,1dkrndldg1d01003,4.0,For example theirs normally a big rush hour but once that ends its super slow. The hardest part about the job is just dealing with rude customers. While the easiest is doing Sweeps or any easy task such as that.
Safeway,1dkrbpu511d0h002,1.0,Worked there for 2 years and worked my butt off. You feel totally unappreciated. Felt like a number not an employee. My mother was dieing in the hospital and all my manager was worried about was a doctor's note. Don't want to work for a company that has no compassion for their employees. I quit.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dkqvgidp24gh002,5.0,Safeway is an Excellent Environment for entry level young and ambitious employees to thrive in. It is a fast paced competitive work place yet still has a family type of work place culture and would be a great place for anyone to work in
Safeway,1dkqotvvj1d11005,2.0,"VERY LOW PAY! They lie constantly to get you in the door. I was told benefits were available after 90 days. NOPE! 1 year. I had to work for a manager that had every weekend, holiday off. She would not cover for me when I needed to call in because my home flooded from broken pipes. MAJOR FAVORTISM, and bullying. I saw many people bully one specific employee. Then I transferred stores and was told nothing would change, everything changed!!! I lost my pay, sick days and vacation. DON'T WORK HERE!"
Safeway,1dkpqr2oj24e1000,4.0,I've been working there for quite awhile now. I still love working there due to the almost family like atmosphere that has been created but the management has been worsening and the scheduling even worse. They listen to your complaints and minor requests but they never act on them and the complaints are never resolved. Action after listening definitely needs to be taken into account. Also the hiring manager has hired great people from time to time although there are plenty of questionable characters that have been given a job here.
Safeway,1dkotqcje1d0h002,3.0,"Flexible Scheduling really means that you must have open availability,  and you'll get scheduled 20 hours, dependent on when its determined that you are needed."
Safeway,1dkotjgpd24fh008,3.0,- easy and fast paced
Safeway,1dkoebti324f1000,1.0,"It was definitely a case of too many chiefs and not enough Indians. We were pressured to meet quotas of immunizations, every year. Even on TdaP. If you met your quota, the goal would go up the next time. I felt like I was a used car salesman. I also felt the company was not interested in health care, just profit."
Safeway,1dkobm69c1d0h000,5.0,I enjoyed safeway.  Opportunity to meets lots of people from all over the world.
Safeway,1dkobepg324g1000,3.0,"I took this while I was in collage. There were fairly flexible with hours. It was lots of throwing load and stocking, but that was expected. I do suggest always dressing warm with this job."
Safeway,1dko4k28q24f1002,4.0,"I have worked for Safeway for 18 years and I have enjoyed all of it, until the takeover by Albertsons. They changed many things and were more interested in saving money than loyal people.  Even the customers noticed."
Safeway,1dkmg9q6l24e1005,3.0,Overall good place to work. Peasant environment nice employees. Most enjoyable part is seeing all the regular customers. Hardest part is walking in expecting to work as one thing but the getting pulled to do something else. Management is questionable.
Safeway,1dkmb517n0mch002,3.0,"I came back to work with some fellow coworkers that made the working atmosphere better.  Lack of management, new procedures and the lack of hiring new people hindered the daily work that needed to be finished.  Having consistently 1-2 people understaffed in the section of the grocery store I worked in halted the completion of our daily tasks."
Safeway,1dkm3t5up1fdi000,2.0,I can't make my bills they cut my hours from 25-30 each week. It's not consistent days each week is different. I like my co-workers but getting a .5 cent raise each year is not competitive with other companies. I wouldn't complain if they paid me more and gave me more hours.
Safeway,1dkm2sf9f1d11003,5.0,"A good place to work. Safe environment, helpful coworkers, great customer service. Management is fair and treats every coworkers the same. The store is kept clean."
Safeway,1dkm2b5ai0mt1003,3.0,Had a great time while working produce ! Worked about 8 hours a day and management was actually great through-out my time but had to relocate to another state.
Safeway,1dklrkqcs1d0h001,2.0,"Rarely have I been so abused. Called in on most every day off, extended past end of shift. Took a leave of absence to deal with a medical issues and harassed upon return. Great money but not worth the headache in any way. Great customers made it bearable"
Safeway,1dklh7k541d01000,3.0,Been working for the company for 26 years.  Currently the company is heading in a direction that the future and security that was once there is no longer.
Safeway,1dkleakah1d01000,3.0,"You have to be flexible. The team can be helpful, but everyone is stressed due to the demands of upper management. Hours/pay is unfair and inconsistent."
Safeway,1dkk1gobe1d01004,3.0,"the job was trash and the management was trash, employees were pretty cool at times but over all it sucked the life out of me and made me hate my life"
Safeway,1dkjsbqb90kbh002,4.0,I didn’t want to work there if i wasn’t getting paid correctly. Safeway wasn’t giving me enough hours in a week so i quit. If i got more hours i would have stayed there.
Safeway,1dkjsa86p1d0h000,3.0,I felt absolutely awful at times because they kept telling me they could fire me for no reason and thay honestly crushed my morale and made me think of nothing but getting out of work for the day.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dkjp24440kbh002,4.0,I had a lot of friendly co workers loved working there and I'd work there again if I could the customers are really great as well made me smile everyday
Safeway,1dkjmf7t61d01000,5.0,Great environment helpful easy paced and fast paced staff happy and prosperous easy hours to work with nice and happy environment training is on point
Safeway,1dkjlg5631fdi004,4.0,Been with safeway for near 5 years loved it was trained n developed to move forth skills atoned n sharped n area n ideas ready for my nxt job n position at my new job
Safeway,1dkj5cubo1d11000,2.0,"(24th and NobHill Safeway) Disorganized upper management favored employees, there was random schedules, overworked w lack of hours (last 3-4 days of work week then the first 3-4 days of beginning of work week) 2-4 days off a week, weekly pay, no overtime, people complained to cashiers about prices"
Safeway,1dkiaoidp1d0h000,4.0,Not a bad job I like it. The interview I believe took like 30 minutes. They were really nice and helpful with any questions I had about the store. I appreciate that.
Safeway,1dki6onvsbre6806,4.0,"Faced paced environment, As a personal shopper, responsible for pulling online customer's grocery orders , scanned picked and packed for delivery, Every day was different and very faced paced. My department  manager was very hardworking and very patient, nice guy."
Safeway,1dkhp32ce24go002,4.0,"Your typical run-of-the-mill retail job. You have certain tasks that you are assigned by the supervisor, and sometimes asked by the store manager to do other tasks that sometimes may be a challenge, but in the end you gain experience doing so. The pay was good for a first job, and you gain a lot of customer service experience as you learn the ropes and interact with customers on a daily basis. There can be opportunities to move within the store to another department should an opening come up."
Safeway,1dkh6ssc55nb4802,4.0,"Hired as Produce Manager, before 90 days was demoted to produce clerk due to inadequate training. Was never advised  how to do inventory. Only 2 weeks of training, the trainer didn't have time to train me so I had to try and figure it out myself. To many things to learn in that little bit of time"
Safeway,1dkh6fn1lb81o802,5.0,i worked in the deli. they are a great friendly company. they help you learn what you will be doing at that job till you fully understand it. the managers will come and help if you get overrun with customers.
Safeway,1dkgvieafbre6802,3.0,I wouldn't recommend that anyone to apply for a job at the Clearlake Safeway. Do to the lack of respect for the employees. Hours fluctuate to where it was never the same weekly.
Safeway,1dkgedskth3oh802,5.0,"Its both a quick paced and slow paced job depending on the department you’re placed in. It also teaches you how to adapt in difficult situations, and how to help customers as best as you can with a smile."
Safeway,1dkfgpmp024go000,3.0,"Friendly work atmosphere, sometimes stressful esp. for new-comers or those with less experience, but team-working is good and it helps creating confidence and motivation. knowing how to multi-task is a big asset, esp. for management positions like mine. Also, it's interesting to deal with many customers of different requirements and/or complaints and reach a positive outcome to make them happy, thankful, and having a delightful shopping experience, that's the most enjoyable part of my work. I've learned a lot in this business, produce and other departments codes, doing money orders / transfers, being always calm and self-contained to handle any stressful situations, how to prioritize tasks, improve productivity, always motivate team-workers even when under pressure."
Safeway,1dkffin3rbre6800,5.0,"A typical day as a fuel clerk is mostly cashiering, and a little sweeping and mopping.  I was alone most of the night, so it was kind of peaceful work."
Safeway,1dkf0cno5h3oh800,3.0,It is a perfectly fine place to work if you are looking for a place to pay for rent or food while going to school. You must be self-motivated because there are many people who do not put in the effort. Overall it is an above average grocery store.
Safeway,1dkep4pg6b85q802,2.0,The manager/employee ratio was about 1 manager/2 employees. The people working there were often lazy or unprofessional. No respect for work/home life balance. They expect you to break yourself for them while paying you minimum wage.
Safeway,1dkeokbmtb81o804,3.0,*The job is fine the management is what gets to you. I've worked here for quiet some time and your co workers can make work life fine but management asks for unreasonable tasks to be done and threaten with write ups/ suspension when not complete. Customers can be rude and nasty everyone should have a job in retail at some point this job is easy. Your bosses make it a pain and ive had a few manager changes in my store.
Safeway,1dkemkdmah40n800,4.0,"My tipacal day is bagging for costemers,"
Safeway,1dkec9enob89b802,2.0,"I wont even shop at this place after working there. They treat the employees like pawns. Management is horrible, and being replaced every 3 months. Terrible company."
Safeway,1dkdpvtmeb85q802,4.0,"It can be a tough job. There is always a lot to do and the hours can be difficult, but the compensation is worth it. Plus there is always room to grow within the company."
Safeway,1dkcdual1b81m800,1.0,Dont walk RUN........This place sucks!!
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dkcbl2c1b81m802,3.0,Safeway was a good job for the time being. But I was there for over a year and I’m only 17 so it was just time for something new. The employees there were all very friendly and helpful. There was always something to do so I could keep myself busy. Overall it was a good job.
Safeway,1dkb7sp3f24gn002,5.0,My time working at Safeway was great. Safeway is great job for young adults. I had a great time while I working at Safeway. I had great managers that I work with.
Safeway,1dkac0rtn24fq007,4.0,I worked as a courtesy clerk so for me it was very slow paced. I enjoyed the work because your crew is always so nice and helpful but your work was limited to your job position.
Safeway,1dkabcb64b81m800,4.0,It’s a great place to work. You learn different skills everyday. Getting to know customers and seeing regulars is one of the best parts of the jobs. Listening to how their day went and what their plans are for the evening just makes my day. I find it hard sometimes to understand some customers through the loud background noise but everything else about the job is great!
Safeway,1dka4vpm7bre4802,3.0,"While the customers and other employees were pleasant for the most part, management often crumpled the paper bag of a healthy work environment. Employees are often required to work extra hours and school requirements are not always respected."
Safeway,1dka4iaihb85o801,5.0,"Having spent 17 years with Safeway, I was able to see many different side of the business. Safeway has gone through many drastic changes since I have been an employee, but for the most part, I am glad to have been part of the evolution of the company."
Safeway,1dk9o9od0b898802,4.0,"The work day at safeway or any store goes by really slow, but the work is good and the people are nice, very respectful and they take pride in helping others"
Safeway,1dk9gbaat24gn002,3.0,Lots of nepotism there. It's not fair the 3rd&4th key are mother and son and the deli manger is the 3rd key daughter and the deli asst manager is married to the 4th key. It's bad there
Safeway,1dk83fdsmbre4802,4.0,Working at Safeway is interesting because of the various type of customers that you may have every day. Having amazing coworkers and managers makes the job worthwhile.
Safeway,1dk73fjp0bre4800,1.0,I put in a schedule days I can and cannot work they don’t care they’ll schedule you when they want whatever’s convenient for them is what you get. Can’t request certain days off no matter how far ahead you tell them
Safeway,1dk6u8550b898800,4.0,Great place to work. Great benefits. Great culture. Advancement opportunities. Fair wages. Management a bit out of touch with day to day operations. Would probably work there again if I didn’t have a job I love.
Safeway,1dk6qt2f1b898800,4.0,Its an ok job for the money. Some overtime. The scheduling sucks they schedule is only a week out hard to request time off. Store is constantly cutting hours.
Safeway,1dk6qekvib898800,5.0,Felt welcomed and respected. The whole warehouse worked as a team in order to succeed. Good work place and the teams were amazing. Enjoyed it very much so
Safeway,1dk6nscuob81m802,1.0,Literally the worst job ever. They tell you to hide things from corporate and that they will back you up if corporate finds it. They dont and corporate does find it. If you do it the way corporate wants it your manager will complain that you dont have the time to do it that way and try to discipline you for doing things thr proper way. Who knows new manager now but I have seen 2 store managers and 3 assistants and no luck changing so good luck with the job.
Safeway,1dk6aievcb81m802,3.0,"Low responsibility jobs for low to mid pay. Great place for a first job. Plenty of management advancement opportunities, however if you go to management you should expect to work more than have a social life."
Safeway,1dk699nqmb898804,1.0,Back in the early 90s Safeway have a great company to work for but they have steadily gone downhill and now owned by Albertsons if you want a nightmare go to work for them
Safeway,1dk67m7qnh3kg800,3.0,If management was better I would of stayed! I had 12 years invested. Had many good memories and not so good. Can’t be a weak person working here cause they take advantage of it.
Safeway,1dk5847rmb81m800,3.0,"Depending upon the particular manager you have the opportunity to work with, your level of training will certainly vary. Be sure to ask questions, if you are unsure"
Safeway,1dk4rt1q0bre4800,5.0,Looking to move ahead and be able to provide for my family and put away enough money in my 401k to enable me and my wife to travel after retirement by the age of 65.
Safeway,1dk4rp0k4b85o800,1.0,"My experience at Safeway was horrible. I was micromanaged and told constantly how much I could’ve done and never felt appreciated. They say “flexible” time off, but it’s per their approval, and it was a fight every time trying to ask for a day off being part-time."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dk4kukdeb85o802,1.0,Good starting job for most people with steady pay and job protections through the Union.  Ill tampered and overworked management mostly with frequent turnover.
Safeway,1dk4j35lgh3og800,5.0,Awesome company to work for. They are really family oriented. You can move up fairly quickly. I worked there for 4 months and was asked to be closing manager. Sadly I had to move.
Safeway,1dk4g81bqb85o800,5.0,"Good job been there over 25 years,the benefits are good ,Also generous time off with pay and sick leave , flexible for school schedule and good retirement pension."
Safeway,1dk438l8ab81m802,5.0,"I really liked working at Safeway Auburn, The people there are really great to work with from MGMT to drivers. The benefits, Pension, and Pay are top shelf.  If you like long hours and differing shifts at first then this place is a great place to work."
Safeway,1dk3g1gltb898800,4.0,"Great place to work, good people, teamwork is encouraged. There is a lot of opportunity for advancement. I started as an Administrative Assistant and advanced to a Promotional Specialist."
Safeway,1dk2j1n6ab81m802,2.0,It was great at first but now I think Safeway treats their good employees terrible. They only want you to be about Safeway and they don't care if you're in college they won't work with your schedule. Maybe it's just the Safeway I'm at.
Safeway,1dk29i5f5b85o801,3.0,"The good part about Safeway was getting a decent amount of hours, but it only came with hard work and showing the managers that I was capable."
Safeway,1dk260aorb81m800,2.0,"Management was hands off and uncommunicative. The scheduling was a nightmare. One week, it'd be back to back opening and closing shifts, and the next, it'd be fifteen hours for the whole week. The workplace culture was all around pretty depressing. It was clear that no one really wanted to be there. At least the work was easy. Probably the worst/hardest thing I had to do was take out the trash at the end of the night, but at least that was a break from the tedium."
Safeway,1dk25epf0b81m803,2.0,A good team can make it a good place to work & a lousy unsupportive team can make it suck.  Turnover at my store was high. Lots of complaints from customers about things we couldn't change--like the homeless outside the store.
Safeway,1dk2561vobre4800,2.0,"When I first started there, the coworkers were nice and the job was fun. Nice store, was excited to be a part of the team. But I was only getting 20 hours a week, so I asked for more. They told me if I was a good employee I’d get more the longer I worked there. Well they told me a few times throughout the next few months that I was doing a great job, but they kept cutting my hours. I kept asking about it and sometimes they’d write me in for an extra shift. Well now lately they aren’t doing that, and they have me on for 0 hours a week. I don’t know why they even hired me, if they didn’t want me to work here."
Safeway,1dk1i65eb24fq000,4.0,During my time at CHI I learned a lot. I traveled to many different clinics and because of the we were able to provide care to all of the Omaha/Council Bluffs metro area.
Safeway,1dk1f1mc6b896800,2.0,"Employees are monitored like inmates, and treated very poorly. Constantly reminded that people are expendable, especially by the director. Condescending to his employees."
Safeway,1dk192anibre4800,2.0,I couldn't even leave for the day when a friend died. I had to cry in front of customers the last 3 hours. They kept me 3 hours under being able to get insurance the whole time.
Safeway,1dk15jic1bre4800,4.0,"In this type of industry you need to be a self starter, motivated, be coach able, need to take direction well."
Safeway,1dk129ronh40l802,5.0,One of the best jobs I worked at great for you if your big on having your future set good benefits retirement plan and all was room to grow with the company and make more money
Safeway,1dk10gf2n5j63800,4.0,"One of my best work experiences, as far as working goes. The managers work with you to help you grow with the company instead of trying to force you to bend like publix does."
Safeway,1djvj658fb85k800,4.0,"Great place to get a foot in the door. Fast paced, customer service oriented, but the higher you get the more stress. Can advance quickly if you show drive"
Safeway,1djvdlcehb85k800,5.0,Safeway is and  excellent place to work helps you with experience in retail and customer service  not only that  it is a great environment I’m very positive
Safeway,1djv9r9jlbre0801,1.0,"At first working for Vons was great. Now that Albertsons owns it, it has gone downhill."
Safeway,1djv0mfdpb85k800,3.0,I have worked for Safeway for 10 years and for 10 years I have watched people pushed to be faster amd more acurate and yelled at if they can't do their job fast enough.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1djuvpsmnb892802,4.0,"Definitely for entry level job seekers, just looking to get some more experience. Overall management was fair, and reasonable. Can be very busy and hectic at times. Most certainly would not recommend making a career out of it, however they have many long time employees that have moved up within the company."
Safeway,1djujffp15nfh800,2.0,"Safeway Pharmacy has very little employee appreciation. It is more like, pass the buck and see who it lands on. The best thing about this company is that you are a part of a union and they actually have your back."
Safeway,1djuhr2ivb85k800,3.0,None at this time. Just need new job with better pay. Require too much from their employees. The managers are excellent but the corporate people are not willing to do anything for their employees. They only look at $$$$$
Safeway,1djtcdtdnb81i800,3.0,Ok job but only part time available. This job doesn't offer full time so they won't have to pay full benefits. Small discounts on Safeway brands and gas.
Safeway,1djsrmijbbre0801,4.0,"It was very fast pace, I was on my feet my entire shift doing work and helping customers.  I learned that I am indeed a very good employee. Hardest part was running back items and running items to the register while I had to sweep the store.  Most enjoyable was the compliments I got from customers about how I helped them a lot and how good of an employee I am."
Safeway,1djsn906e5nav802,3.0,"Job can be very face paced. Always found myself busy. If I wasn't answering calls or taking orders I would be restocking, cooking, cleaning, organizing, getting shipments, and packaging food items. Can be a bit stressful at times but overall was not a bad work experience."
Safeway,1djqje3asb892801,3.0,The company lacks employee appreciation in some stores but has good schedule flexibility and great benefits. At times the work load is too much because they lack employees to help.
Safeway,1djq93dojb81i805,3.0,"Working here overall isn't too bad. Fast paced environment for the most part, got pretty good hours, health benefits, paid vacations. etc. Sometimes the management is not easy to communicate with."
Safeway,1djplmgnkb892800,2.0,"Safeway did not provide any training or leadership upon starting my position. Additionally,the coworkers I worked with on the overnight shift were more concerned with their individual numbers instead of working together as a team and helping each other out."
Safeway,1djp6kj9ebre0800,1.0,"With the amount of work required and the amount of training given, I was no where near prepared to complete any of that work when expected of me a few days after becoming a cake decorator. All the store manager does is come and point out what we don't have out (that I already know) and waste my time then tell me I should just simultaneously make 5 of something with no regard to how complicated the thing is. It's way too stressful and I can't wait until I can resign, but I just need to get another job first."
Safeway,1djohl3ebh3hn800,3.0,Most days were like trying to put 6 gallons of water in a 5-gallon bucket. I was not uncommon to have not enough hours to complete all the tasks and corporate micromanages the stores to the point of lost sales and disgruntled staff. I really enjoyed working with the people I worked alongside and most of the in-store management was really quality.
Safeway,1djnja6sq24f0000,4.0,Nice job I really was compensated for as much work as I did. Management was not very helpful. They were to personal with the job that they didn’t make things easier.
Safeway,1djn1qrphb84k802,2.0,"It was great working their  but they over worked me as a courtesy clerk. I have a degree in human resource management but they put me under bagging, however much how hard I worked they refused to train me for anything instead they pushed me in flowers to help those ladies in flower department. They only help family members or their own race, until I quit because they never appreciated my work."
Safeway,1djn131e0brdd802,5.0,"Idk what I have to write but the job is 4 10’s, long days at work, no weekends! Must meet 97 percent standard every 30 hour block period, work most holidays"
Safeway,1djmdv3p0h3vp800,5.0,The company management (Supervisors) were great  very approachable always open to suggestion to improve production.
Safeway,1djkbepg2b84k802,2.0,Safeway is a very hard company to work for. very tight on there schedules to the point of one person doing 4 jobs. And they don't care if a store in Idaho has a full staff case minimum wage is lower. the expectation is that one person to do what three people do at a store of equle sales  Volume. To be ran and look the same. And will write you up if it dose not.
Safeway,1djk7bf97brdd800,3.0,"Safeway offers room for growth, whether it be a promotion from a Courtesy Clerk to a Cashier and/or Management! Safeway is all about above and beyond customer service."
Safeway,1djiklkn6b88v800,3.0,"I personally had a bad experience working at Safeway on the night crew, as a night stocker. The pay was terrible but I had just moved to the state and needed to have job history. the store manger was a jerk and wanted the worker to work off the clock to make him look better."
Safeway,1djhhmsj4brdd800,4.0,"I was actually sad when I had to quit this job,  my coworkers were all great management started cutting hours but only for newer employees, so seniority does count."
Safeway,1djgaeenubrdd800,4.0,Things constantly change there. It's not bad if you plan on a short term employment. I do not think it is the best place to be for a long time career.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1djg21ob8brdd800,4.0,"The job itself requires constant movement and being able to work independently as well as working with other. Being able to take instruction and execute the task given effectively. Management has always been good, any complaints I heard about management were very minor complaints or because of the individuals work ethic which is managements job to call out any inconsistencies they see. The people were amazing and is probably one of the best parts of the job."
Safeway,1djfthopcb80q800,2.0,"The job was okay, the management was what I personally had a problem with. I would request days off months in advance and not get them off and then when i couldn’t work because of the events that occurred on those days I got fired."
Safeway,1djfqlm90brdd805,4.0,"It was an alright job, can't complain much since it was easy and didn't require too much effort. Working as a courtesy clerk is an easy job and a good starting job."
Safeway,1djf560jibrdd800,3.0,"Working in a room 40 degrees all day..cold hands,and wet feet.working with wet product.Using sharp knifes.Making sure everything is done is quick matter.."
Safeway,1djf4ggkp24f0000,3.0,"This job was a good first job for somebody just starting out in their in their career trying to figure out what they wanted to do. Management was sort of understanding with schedules that needed to be met, but didn't always work with people that needed certain schedules."
Safeway,1djes6bo1b84k802,4.0,Great for a student or someone looking for a part-time job. The pay is not the best but there's room to move up quickly and they will usually work around your class schedule.
Safeway,1djdg02r8b84k802,4.0,"management is always wiling to work with you when you have life problems arise and understanding. co workers are upbeat and friendly, and willing to help..."
Safeway,1djde2m6hbrdd800,1.0,"I did not have any experience no proper training and no manager for seafood department. It was dirty and not well kept. Everything mislabeled, it was a nightmare. I was getting paid minimum wage and doing everything.  Employees were bossing me around and didn't want to work w seafood. Store manager was rude to all latinos & didn't  have no empathy when I wasn't feeling too good. Didn't go back one day."
Safeway,1djd9gsg7b88v800,1.0,Horrible nothing is positive about this company they will suck you dry and make you feel bad about your self
Safeway,1djcol456brdd800,3.0,"Safeway will always be considered an extra income job. even full-time employee gets less than 40 hrs a week, good for college graduates and people looking for the second job."
Safeway,1djcob357b80q803,3.0,"Work there was good, learned my great customer services there, learned how to treat people correctly, learned how to become a hard worker. Fun if u are a manager"
Safeway,1djao08tqbrdd802,1.0,worked there a total of 6 years and never once got a raise even after asking 30000 times you get told yes and its a promise you will never see I moved up to assistant manager was promised a raised to 15 an hour did it for a year and never saw that raise
Safeway,1djallu78b84k800,3.0,"The job paid minimum wage but typically would not give employees adequate hours per week, even to those with permanent positions. Often understaffed, but friendly coworkers and you receive some discounts when shopping at the store."
Safeway,1dja37nnab80q800,5.0,I worked mid-day to closing shifts. I worked the lunch and dinner rushes and then closed the deli by myself or one other person most nights. Lots of work for very little reward. You got in trouble even after closing for wearing headphones. Store management for sexist and rude to female employees. My co-workers were great and we became friends outside of work. Overall enjoyed working for the company.
Safeway,1dj92qjarb80q800,2.0,"The management yells at the employees. None of the employees are happy cause of the yelling. They treat the employees like garbage. They are nice to the customers but it’s all a show. Insurance isn’t good because there is a high deductible the pay is min wage and there’s union dues. Eventually after 3 years, the wage is better but not always FT hours"
Safeway,1dj82qrf3b8bm802,5.0,Come into work about 5 to 10 minute before start of shift. Check with my lead to see if there is anything special I should know about. Get everything setup to support clients.
Safeway,1dj69hj1m1d0b002,4.0,gained a lot of experience and got to meet new people and help out a lot of customers. i was always willing to come in and help out whenever they needed me.
Safeway,1dj60ecf8b8bm800,1.0,I learned a lot while working at the select location I was at. There was a vast array of personality types and backgrounds who would come through my line and it taught  me a lot about conflict resolution.
Safeway,1dj5r6hp2brcm801,5.0,A pleasant and fun place to work. I enjoyed the time I spent working within the floral department and as a cashier. The supervisors and management were all exceptional employees.
Safeway,1dj5b7vtp1d0b001,4.0,.Manage the daily production standards of union selectors.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dj52mmku1d0b000,2.0,They were always understaffed so I had to do multiple job positions at the same time while getting paid for just one. Also the work culture was nit fun because the coworkers didn't get along well.
Safeway,1dj4j8gle1d0b000,3.0,The union does nothing to help when management doesn't follow the rules. This store is used as punishment by corporate for managers they want to quit. The store suffers in turn.
Safeway,1dj3i35g81d0n002,3.0,"Management is a bit of a mixed bag but generally the good people make it worthwhile. Very fast paced, very customer oriented. Be prepared to be constantly on your toes."
Safeway,1dj32o0v01d0n000,2.0,"The particular store I worked at was very poorly managed. We where constantly understaffed, underpaid, and management offered little praise ever, it was only ever micro-managing, not to mention it was impossible to move up. Numerous people who had been working there for decades, retained jobs as cashiers. Management also had an issue with never standing up for employees. The vast majority of the time they let us be treated horribly, and would never take into account the other side of the story. Not even when the customer was blatantly in the wrong (one guy got a bagel thrown at him and the customer was allowed back in the store as if nothing happened, it was even caught on camera!). My particular department was fine. However I was working almost full time to full time (back then as a minor mind you which is illegal) when I got hired as a part time employee (25 hrs or less) going to school full time as a 16/17 year old, and I couldn't get a cut in hours because management insisted we where 'fine'. I cant speak for other Safeway locations, but to sum it up, this place was a mess the entire time I worked there. And from what I heard from co-workers, other locations weren't much better. Its an easy job, but only if you're willing to work way more than you want, and deal with poor management."
Safeway,1dj2qj4dpb8bm800,1.0,You are just a number got let go after 18 years for being 5 min short for the week on their standards. When you start you will most likely be working nights and weekends no family life.
Safeway,1dj2hpn02h3r3800,5.0,Decent pay and good benifits can't complain my mangers were fine not to stressful got to leave on time there is opportunity to move up if you desire management work
Safeway,1dj2b6rahbrcm800,5.0,I love working at safeway as a cashier it's fun friendly and competitive as well as a fast paced work environment... I would recommend anyone to work there
Safeway,1dj15enkb1d0n002,1.0,I work in the bakery department and we are at constant odds with management regarding availability of hours. Corporate never seems to allow enough hours for our department to accomplish even the most basic tasks that are required to be completed daily. The position is stressful and can be emotionally and mentally exhausting.
Safeway,1dj0p3spfb8bm800,4.0,"Loved the job but wish I worked like wise hours and not scheduled late night, mid shift and days all in the same week.  Benefits would have been nice and pay practice need to be equal for all staff, especially working holidays and weekends"
Safeway,1dj0grq0i1d0b002,3.0,"This company is not a bad company to work for, it can be very stressful, but the people are great, I made great relationships with people... but they do expect a lot put of a person."
Safeway,1divoe4f8brcm800,5.0,Safeway is a good working experience. They also have good benefits. Flexible hours as well.  Workplace culture is nice because you meet different people.. I also have workmates which are good to me.. We are helping each other during our shifts because whether you like it or not you should be nice to everyone..
Safeway,1div3l2mg52tn800,5.0,Wonderful staff  and food the interviewing process was great working for the deli department was the most exciting experience that I have had in an long time.
Safeway,1diu3vd6v1d0b002,4.0,I enjoy working here. Have had many opportunities for advancement. Greatly enjoy working with my food service team to assist customers with all their deli needs.
Safeway,1ditub5qkb8bm802,1.0,Interviewed for a management position and was offered the next position down(assistant). For weeks I worked under someone who had less than two weeks of experience and knew nothing(obviously). Turns out this person above me was friends with the overall store manager and was given the job because so.  Had to constantly fix Mistakes from my manager until the day he stepped down from his position.
Safeway,1ditsgrcoh3gh802,3.0,I got this job as a high school student and it was a good started job and got me the retail experience I needed to go on to something better. There was a lot of mindless tasks that had to be done.
Safeway,1ditpkorib8bm802,5.0,I have learned a lot at working at Safeway by what product to use when cleaning the restrooms. I learned how to read the numbers on the item to make sure its up for the right price. Learning where all the products are located at in the store.
Safeway,1ditnlv2uh3gh800,1.0,The store and its management team are immature and unprofessional. They make the work environment there for employees not in any way easy for you to do your tasks and they refuse to add additional hires to the departments that are needing help most desperately.
Safeway,1ditn6jdbb8bm800,1.0,I was expected to do the job of 3 people for minimum wage and no benefits. I learned it's a bad company to work for. Customers yelled at me because there was nobody to help get the lines down.   I hated this job. It was the worst I've ever had.
Safeway,1dithiq83h43c802,2.0,The reason I would rate a 0 on management portion. They have poor management and only hire people that are their friends or family with no skill whatsoever. The pay is great they're competitive with the Bay area. Overall all of the general warehouse labor employees are easy to get along with and also the Union Representatives. My job interview took long before I got one.
Safeway,1dit1bnd0h46t800,1.0,The store manager has no idea how to run the store and picks favorites. she also fired half of our crew for no reason and refused to replace them. People were kept on the schedule even though they didn't work there anymore. ( meaning everyone that did still work there got no days off because she kept scheduling people that didn't work there)
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dit0rpk0h3r3802,5.0,"This was a great company - great leadership, great people, fun environment.  Very fast-paced.  Only downsize was my commute.  I am not sure what it is like now that they have been bought by Albertsons."
Safeway,1dit0d0dc1d0n000,3.0,Safeway is a good starter job. As an employee you need to be open to various schedules with no same day off each week. Your schedule changes weekly.  it is a very fast pasted work environment. You also need to be able to think and make decisions on job tasks on your own and multitask
Safeway,1disuj96rbrcm800,3.0,"My boss was always very accommodating concerning availability changes and emergency time off. However, it seemed like it took a bit of coaxing when I wanted to change departments."
Safeway,1dirrqr501d0n001,1.0,Management communication is a low
Safeway,1dirbnmo3b8bm802,5.0,I’ve been working for the company for 8 years It’s really layed back depending on the store and manger you have it’s only easy if you make it easy... it’s not hard at all everything is pretty easy to catch on to everyday will get easier
Safeway,1dirak9k8brcm800,1.0,"I've worked at 2 locations, and spoken with other employees. It seems across the board a bad place to work, some locations worse than others. My supervisor consistently refused to post our schedule until the night before, and our manager didn't do anything about it. Constantly sexually-harassed by customers and co-workers. And security."
Safeway,1dir36g8ah3gh800,1.0,The safeway was very poorly managed and there is no room to move forward at the company. The only raises available are 25 cents every 6 months. It is perhaps the worst company I have ever worked for.
Safeway,1diqj1mb11d0b002,3.0,"It was more of a fast pace , and a get all the work done in one hour or we are not good enough type of job. It wasn’t for me so I am here to try to find another job."
Safeway,1diq2lj1pb8bm802,3.0,"It was difficult, hard and tiring. I was worked at the freezer department. I worked overnights because it worked well with my schedule with me having a baby and all. I hated working because it was stressful and tiring. I was alone in my department. I had to freaken work my butt off bringing out freaken 2 to 5 pallets every night that were like sky high and stack them. This was an $8hr job and freaken sucks."
Safeway,1dipslac70mte002,5.0,All of the bosses and coworkers were really cool and helpful. I felt really comfortable there. Everybody just wanted everyone to have a good day. On my second day our floor manager told me I was doing an awesome job and gave a little coupon thing it was nice.
Safeway,1dip7celi1d0n000,4.0,"good job everyone was very nice, management was great and they really helped work around my schedule. Great environment and fast pace job! Discounts off food."
Safeway,1diohltseb8bm800,4.0,I started in Starbucks when I was hired.  I was cross trained in several departments within a year. I appreciated learning and promoting. I felt like an asset to the company. But over worked and under paid.
Safeway,1dio3okv75ndc800,2.0,Towson Location Horrible place to work. Management is Mediocre at best and no room for Advancement....Lack of Security.. No incentives for going above and beyond your job
Safeway,1dinpcoqab8bm800,4.0,"If I were to apply for this company, I would go someplace. It is not a good company like it was in the past. It has been deteriorating day after day. The culture has really falling and there is no support from the managers anymore."
Safeway,1dimcakn6b8bl803,4.0,"Safeway was once a coveted job, but now the hiring process lacks quality people.   The pay is very low and managements expectations are the same as years ago.   Over worked and under payed."
Safeway,1dim1a8gqh3ur800,5.0,A good company to work for. A good management team. Good benefits and pension. A good Union job. Good pay And holiday pay. Opportunity to move up in the company.
Safeway,1dilf5tepb87p800,3.0,"For the short period of time that I worked there, I made some good acquaintances, as the company provides an environment in which employees get to interact with each other."
Safeway,1diknteu8h46o801,1.0,I have 20 years of retail management and my experience didnt matter had to start at the bottom. Just moved to the area so I needed a job. Management liked to talk down and yell at the employees. They just dont care and that is the culture from corporate down.
Safeway,1dijtck0l52tb800,3.0,"Decent entry level positions in a variety of areas of the store. At times you are able to be promoted faster than anual wage increases, but not often. Wage increases come quite slow early on and take years to be anything close to meaningful.  Once capped out there is little reason to advance to higher level positions."
Safeway,1dij9m2ooh435800,3.0,"ANI admits a lot of patients to the facility, recommend background in NEURO.  The hardest part of the job is juggling 4-5 pts in the emergency dept with 2 of them being ICU Neuro holds (stroke) and providing the care needed for all assigned to you."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dij58mfmb8b4802,4.0,"A multi-billion dollar company in the food/grocery business. Over 150 stores nationwide. The warehouse employees are LOCAL UNION 104, a difficult, inept and selfish organization."
Safeway,1dij3jgbab87p800,1.0,"Horrible company to work for, rife with worker abuse, no wonder they need a Union; worst company I ever worked for, floating schedule so you don't know your schedule week to week, no holidays or weekends off with your family, they only give 24 hours a week guaranteed to work, everybody for themselves attitude, the worst job I ever worked at!!!"
Safeway,1dihj1a0qb83s803,1.0,"Learned alot, decent management. Loved my costumers and coworkers. Way to much corporate involvement on the store level. Hours were very difficult being a single mother"
Safeway,1dihd9lv01fdk002,4.0,"Was referred by a family member and was my first job. Good company to work for overall decent employee benefits, people were great while I was working there. Wages are fair. Union was nice I felt like I had decent job security."
Safeway,1digk5ap7h46o802,4.0,"Made a ton of new friends it was very inviting!  Work life balance is key not working on weekends or off the clock is critical.  Hardest part is the technology changing and adapting,  I appreciate the people at my job most."
Safeway,1dig593uab83s800,4.0,It’s ok.  The store manager is great with people.  She does a lot for her customers. She hires special needs people and that is an amazing heart.    The people are great and they are very helpful
Safeway,1dieaq1ftb87p801,5.0,Love my jod love the people  good  place to work  They are very open and very flexible with schedules and your school with your children For standing if you had a can of the doctors and we're running late
Safeway,1die77usj1fdk002,2.0,I would reccomend safeway to someone who needs work and able to be flexible with work schedule alot of people get hired at once and not everyone wants to work so if you are ready to work I would recommend
Safeway,1didsstcvb87p804,3.0,Bag groceries. Clean spills. Collect carts. Management crew were nice and friendly. Hard part is getting all the carts in the parking lot. Enjoyable part is bagging groceries
Safeway,1dib9ppn4b8b4801,3.0,I was assigned in deli department. It was stressful because only 2-3 employees. it's not balance. It's always busy cannot finish task quckly.
Safeway,1dib6pjfmb83s804,1.0,"Double standards at Safeway, they like employees who schmooze not employees with strong work ethic and knowledge. Upper management is self centered, condescending and arrogant to the point of being obnoxious. Safeway has no regard for work/life balance with the vibe being you are there to make you boss look good. Prior to Albertsons taking over Safeway was an excellent place to work - not so much anymore. I have worked 17 hour days for a week straight and worked 30 consecutively on occasion."
Safeway,1dib1qfmf5nbq800,3.0,"The job was stressful but the pay and the overtime that I was giving was great. I loved working overnight there. The new store manager and I just never really got along so she fired me, it’s a long story."
Safeway,1di9uf3bpb8b4802,5.0,I was only with Safeway for one year.  Not because of Safeway but because I was following a dream.  Safeway was a wonderful place to work. Nice people. Positive environment. Great facilities.
Safeway,1di9lhfhebrfq801,4.0,"Easy, fun work environment with many opportunities to advance. Perfect job during school. Very accommodating with hours. Understanding easy to work with managers."
Safeway,1di9iv80qb8ar800,3.0,Too many chiefs and not enough Indians.Too many people want to be managers but don't want to do the manual labor. Hours are ok in the summer. Winter time hours are not enough to live on
Safeway,1di9h0e9kb83i800,3.0,"I work in the deli, and you cant just phone it in, its hard work. but most of the managers are on your side and considering whats our there, career wise, its a great job and very good benefits."
Safeway,1di9ggr3pb87f801,2.0,"I worked at Safeway for over 3 and a half years and they barely paid me more than minimum. I think I got two small raises. Treated poorly, hours used as negotiation tool."
Safeway,1di8k6jsmh3ui802,5.0,"I enjoyed working there. The people working there were friendly and helpful. Management would work with school schedules. There was a variety of positions I worked in, checking, self checkout the liquor department and bagger and getting carts."
Safeway,1di8bmcf3b83i800,3.0,A good high school or fresh out of high school job but not somewhere long term. Very hard to move up and be promoted. Fast pace and involved with customers often.
Safeway,1di7j2rv3b8ar802,3.0,"Everyone will be really friendly, but if it works for theyre schedule, you could be upgraded to manager. They tried having me be manager without the pay because i had the experience and was leaving soon. Good temporary job, dont make a career out of it."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1di7ees73b83h800,5.0,Safeway had very flexible hours that were able to help me work around school and sports. The managers was amazing and so understanding. The co-workers were just as nice
Safeway,1di73kl9nb8ap802,3.0,"Early shifts starting at 3am. Heaving lifting, lots of fast walking. The job keeps you very active. The heavy lifting was the hardest part and bagging items was the easiest."
Safeway,1di727t9bb83b800,5.0,I really liked working at vons becasue the employees where great to be around and so where the customers it was really upset when th store closed It was like losing a family
Safeway,1di70hsf2b83b802,4.0,"This job is a great opportunity for anyone looking for their first job, to get their foot in the door, and gain some work experience under their belt. There are multiple departments from which you can choose to work in and expand your work skills. Working here is about creating a connection with customers and providing an enjoyable shopping experience. There is one ongoing issue with being understaffed due to there not being enough hours -- this becomes frustrating for customers because of extended wait times in line. Workers feel the pressure as well, as they attempt to speed up the process to keep their customers happy. Although there are stressful moments throughout the day, it is helpful to have a supportive work team that guides each other to better serve our customers and remind each other to remain calm and smile."
Safeway,1di6t2mjsb879804,3.0,At Safeway their is a lot to do from bagging grocers to night stocking. their are always people to help. During toe Holiday season it get crazy but don't worry .
Safeway,1di69o7kob83b800,1.0,"Terrible hours , terrible pay. Terrible management. They allow so many people to call out but don’t fire them , manager will not do anything when someone harasses  you they will still have they employed and will even put them on the same shift as you when you’ve told management multiple times you are uncomfortable. Management is childish"
Safeway,1di65afnkb83b802,2.0,"They have a high turnover rate. Management pressures you to finish early. Without any understand ing for the work load. Managers suck with a lack of leadership , charictor, or team spirit."
Safeway,1di64j1245nfr802,3.0,The guidelines I had at Safeway was stocking selves bagging selves greet customers and helping customers to there cars when needed.i also would clean wipe things down when needed

Safeway,1di4rs6hib83b800,4.0,"My experience with working at Safeway was great. Everyone was very friendly and Safeway provided a very comfortable workplace. It seemed like everyday I was learning something new.The management team was very nice and was always there to answer any questions I had. I learned how to address many different problems and assist many different customers. The hardest part about the job was trying to assist customers with information I didn't have. thanks to my co workers and management team, I was able to assist anyone. The most enjoyable part of the job was making friends with a lot of my co workers."
Safeway,1di4g5a2bb83b800,4.0,"Working at safeway is harder now then it used to be. Benefits used to be better and the moral used to be way better. Since Albertsons took over Safeway has gone a little downhill since then, If you find a great manager make sure you stick with them."
Safeway,1di4c3bpih42n801,5.0,I really enjoy working at safeway I feel like it is a clean and safe place to work. The manager's will work with your schedule I feel that it is a productive workplace and I get along well with my fellow employes and managers.

Safeway,1di3jb97kh3ub800,4.0,"At my time at Safeway, I learned a few things. I learned how to talk and interact and work with customers to have a successful outcome. I learned to work hard and work with coworkers efficiently. I learned how to be punctual and accurate and honest in all situations. If ser me up well for future companies."
Safeway,1di1lggrnb83b800,1.0,"Not the best place to work. They work how the customers want and not what is actually needed, or logically. After I leave, it's over. Never going back."
Safeway,1di1le7lsh3ub802,3.0,Not a place for someone who does not want to work hard.   Depending on location you will work with some great managers. You must be available to work any day of the week and any hours.
Safeway,1dhvvv1tabrfh802,1.0,It's retail. What do you expect? Wage theft? Check. Cutting department hours and making you do more work for the same pay? Check. A livable paycheck? Ch... no.
Safeway,1dhuuffhpb8am800,5.0,"I enjoyed working at safeway but the pay wasn't enough, and the commute was too far for me. But over all I had great coworker's, that were willing to help and teach roles. Offer cross training for all departments to hel pl with advancements."
Safeway,1dhusqaa0brfh800,4.0,Great place to work always met new people and a few old friends. Management was great and gave me close to full-time hours even though I was part time.
Safeway,1dhur7fp0b879800,3.0,Management depends on who you talk to in my opinion. Always understaffed on checkers and other departments. (The staff can say the same thing) Some management will treat you like trash. When people call out on any reason they will talk to you a day later.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dhuovr7mh3mb800,4.0,"management sucked i was hired in a hiring event i worked for about two consistent months,as tey hired more people my hours began to dwindle.Eventually , my name wasnt on the schedules any more and so i assumed i was let go."
Safeway,1dhu8j9mnbrfh801,4.0,Working with safeway over the past 9 years has been a great experience. I was able to expand my work experience ten fold. My only complaint would be that I am unable to transfer to another store and keep my full time.
Safeway,1dhssa1eobrfh802,4.0,"I like the place..... Really do, There is one ""A......(customer)""; once in a while, but overall people are nice, and coworkers are too."
Safeway,1dhsppd82b879800,1.0,"Safeway is union which helps a little, but when you're on the bottom of the totem pole as far as hours are concerned, it's very tough to continue when you're only getting 25 hours a week"
Safeway,1dhskq5frh42n800,4.0,"Performed store product counts and pricing jobs at competitor stores. The position no longer exists, the whole department was laid off/eliminated. The health benefits were awesome for a part-time job."
Safeway,1dhs9b1fu5nfr800,1.0,It was there long to get store hours  the manager I didn't  get along with at all. the store had a roach problem . I did get to grow and learned to have great customer service skills
Safeway,1dhrs8esrh42n800,4.0,"Youd clock in and just jump right in, whether thatd be a bagger, every hour having to bag, do carts, or clean the store, as a cashier youd be at the checkstand ringing up custumers and asking how their day went and just making sure their shopping experience is good, or as a bakery clerk just jumping in and start pakcaging, labeling, and taking out the products as well as helping sutomers with any questions they may have."
Safeway,1dhrcftrph3qc802,4.0,I worked in deli but wanted to learn everything I could. I do miss my job and need to work on obtaining employment at this point in time and would appreciate to utilize my skills
Safeway,1dhqv8vk9b8am802,1.0,This store would be awesome under new management. The manager is nothing but a bully who treats her employees like they’re not to be respected. The environment is so intense because everyone walks on eggshells scared that she the store manager might do something if they speak up for themselves. Instead the store manager deliberately makes it so uncomfortable that employees left to rite quit or transfer.. This is by far the worst store to work at. Wouldn’t recommend it in a trillion years. All management needs to get fired!!!!
Safeway,1dhq2ioi5b83b800,1.0,"I dislike working here but I love my coworkers, they’re very sweet and understanding. Management sucks. The main person who’s in charge of the whole store should be let go of, they have so many marks against them from the union."
Safeway,1dhpu1j0r52so800,4.0,You have some downtime because you dont' have that many customers until a certain time of day. What i don t like about it is I need something that i can pay my bills and right now it is not working
Safeway,1dhpfii34brfh804,2.0,"In my experience the department managers are good but the store director always bring morale to rock bottom to the point where everyone is quitting including me. However, if you are looking for a job while in college they can accommodate for it. Just don't apply if you are looking for anything more than 30 hours because hours get cut on a regular basis."
Safeway,1dhpanhafb8am801,2.0,"Safeway is a union job, and the way pay raises were administered along with Washington's yearly adjustments to minimum wage meant that the only way to make more money was to advance positions."
Safeway,1dhnl1u6cb8am800,4.0,"It's a company with a solid foundation. It has it's faults and strong points, like every company. Personally, I believe a job experience is largely based in each individual's attitude. My review? The company can lead you to success as long as you show up."
Safeway,1dhndbvk6brfh800,3.0,"If you requested a day off for personal reasons they were very judgmental about it. There was pretty much no benefits to working there, even the discount was small."
Safeway,1dhlu1nhnh3js801,3.0,The job is easy but they don't give enough hours to pay a bill was looking for full time but gave me part time hours. Some customer are very nice and very friendly.
Safeway,1dhlj01u4brfh802,3.0,It was a great job as they worked out schedules around my school. They taught me a lot and I met a lot of people working there. It payed fairly well and had good bonuses.
Safeway,1dhlbffqhb83a800,4.0,"The store is clean and sweep logs are maintained. Employees think themselves are family which is good. Current store manager is great, deals with problems in a snap."
Safeway,1dhkp0p6p5nff801,5.0,I loved working with people so Safeway was a good fit for me. I truly enjoyed working there. Even with transportation issues at the time i was there I still came to work on time everyday. I was always greeted by the manager and felt welcomed at my workplace.
Safeway,1dhker1r1b8ad802,3.0,"I worked as a courtesy clerk and Starbucks barista and honestly didn’t mind my job while I had it. Just show up on time, do what needs to be done right and management will appreciate it. I wish it didn’t take so long to be apart of their union but when your part time that’s how it is. It was easy to juggle life and work due to being part time. Based on your position you are  guaranteed a certain amount of hours per week. You can also ask for more or stay longer if they needed help too."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.

Safeway,1dhihdkg4brev802,5.0,I answered phone calls. I processed prescriptions and counted the medication. When I would receive control medications I would call the Dorctors Office to verify that the prescription was not a fake. The store that I worked at would receive a lot of fake prescriptions. And when that would happen the Pharmacist knew either them or I would call the police. I also rang customers up that were receiving their medications. I would help with expired medications and Inventory that was every 6 months. Basically I helped in the pharmacy where ever they needed me.
Safeway,1dhhvrbrib8ad800,4.0,"The average day of working in the Meat Department was helping customers. cleaning, prepping the food and case to be presentable to the public. And following safety and sanitation guidelines while doing so."
Safeway,1dhhvnmceb86j802,4.0,"Loved working at this store. Great all-around environment. I had the pleasure of running a great grocery crew. The store manager just sat in his office all day until he needed to come out and yell at someone!! But at least my crew made my job a delight, though!!"
Safeway,1dhhtog2r5j6f806,1.0,"poor management who doesn't know how to talk to people with respect and doesn't know how to schedule. either over schedules you too much or none at all. only allows one or two people to work at the Starbucks which is very difficult, as it can get very busy to handle all customers and preparations for orders."
Safeway,1dhhfmh7tb8ad800,3.0,"I’ve always loved the team I’ve worked with and the job itself, but over the years the management has gone more and more down hill. I’m no longer able to effectively do my job at the level that is expected of me due to coverage yet get berated when I don’t accomplish something do to that lack. I’d like to be able to do my job well, and I no longer feel like I can give my full potential here."
Safeway,1dhgck9j1brev800,3.0,"Managers are awful and not consistent. However, there is opportunity for growth within the company and an easy place to work. Hours kind of suck unless you get set with a permanent schedule when you first apply. Open availability looks good and will get you hired. They take advantage of that."
Safeway,1dhg9h89cb82k802,3.0,"I would still be at Safeway if they would have done something about the Bakery manager, she is the reason I walked away from my job.and I loved my job."
Safeway,1dhg40vchbrev800,3.0,"During my time at Safeway, I served mainly as a produce clerk but also had the ability to work the cash register. The job was average. Nothing particularly interesting about it but I had to keep up with standards which taught me good work ethic."
Safeway,1dhetmsqpbreq800,4.0,Helpful management and friendly staff. The manager was always accommodating with adjusting my hours when I needed to.
Safeway,1dhe0ttknh3j2802,2.0,I have worked in a lot of different jobs in my life but this one is by far the worst. But like many employees i am traped here. At one time 20 plus yrs ago this was a good paying job and the treated you right. But we make less every year and the cost of living has sky rocketed. But our great union gets us an 80cent raise every 5yrs.  The management team has 0 leadership skills the corporate team has the same great leadership skills
Safeway,1dhdrp4nrb8aa802,3.0,"Upper mgt. Visits the store does not introduce themselves (I think us peons should know who the boss is) and Why don't they jump in and help instead of watching customers walk because they  haven't been helped yet. I worked for another co. When the big shots visited, if we were busy they would take off their suit coat loosen their tie, roll up their sleeves and help doing whatever needed to be done. At Safeway they stand there and wonder why customers are walking away and ask why. Has anyone told them we are EXTREMELY SHORT HANDED! Don't they get it. And why can't corp. Mgt. See how things really are day to day instead of us putting on a show like everything is running smoothly They really need to reinstate the training program new hires get thrown in to a dept. and basically figure it out on  their own because again we are SHORT HANDED.  Where are the new hires that want to work? My dept. Gets lazy people with no common sense. Who's doing the screening?  On the good side med.benifits, eye and dental coverage with low premiems.  I have been w/ Safeway 8 yrs gone thru 10 mgrs. What's wrong with this co.?"
Safeway,1dhcpr93gb82g800,2.0,I loved this job at first before the manager took over. That's where things got stressful. I was a delivery driver for Safeway. I wouldn't recommend this to no one because unless you desperately need a job

Safeway,1dhbrnkmlbreq801,5.0,It was always busy. I always had something to do and my shifts went by fast. Most of my coworkers were very friendly and the management was great. There were lots of benefits and they worked around my school schedule.
Safeway,1dhaqbt4ob8aa800,1.0,Worst place to work. Management  is mean and lazy and the store shows it. They worship customers  so they pretend and abuse the employees ive seen every manager act up and not care about anything but their numbers. Pay in minimum deli dept is disgusting . Dirty floors slicers sinks drawers refrigerators  not cleaned and management  does not care. They are arec too busy talking while the dept falls apart. Angry customers  waiting  in line because safeway will not hire.Greedy sick company!
Safeway,1dha8gni2breq800,2.0,People hate their jobs are rude dont care im sexually harassed by customers and no one did anything and im a minor. Manager is rude to me its mentally exhausting i dont reccomend this job if your are mentally hanicop becathey will deatroy your spirit.

Safeway,1dha3f2ll0kbg006,3.0,"High production work place. Constant moving and interaction with customers. Baking and packing a variety of bake goods for customers. Operating and maintaining high quality machinery. From the many years at Safeway I have learned how to effectively manage my time to get the most productivity i can in the time that I am give. Really enjoy the preparing and baking of the different breads,cookies and sweet goods that Safeway provides. The work place culture had changed a great deal in the last 5 years production has increased and the staff decreased making it very difficult and stressful for employees. Management has a very hare time filling positions that are vial to the customer service aspect of the company."
Safeway,1dha111chbreq800,1.0,Working at Safeway is stressful everyone is in there has there own clicks if you dont fit in they will fire you I worked there for over 7 years and I seen it happen all the time .very unprofessional bosses there are very rude and will cut your hours over anything also bosses will tell your personal information to people that work there .I would never work there again and if you are looking to work there go to frys ...
Safeway,1dh9q7bhi5j67800,4.0,This was my first work experience. I attended school half a day and worked as well throughout my 12th grade year. I learned how to save my money while getting paid weekely.
Safeway,1dh9lpt15b86a800,2.0,When i was working here i just felt like the main manager of the area i was in didnt like me. I was going to my college classes and working closing so my days off are my class days and i would have on average 3-5 days off a week and less that 15 hours between those 2 days which is not enough mony to even relax with when you drive yourself everywhere. my checks were hardly enough to fill my gas tank.

Safeway,1dh8m44rph3j2800,3.0,In my management position I had a hard time as Albertsons had just bought out Safeway.Had to comform to Albertsons way of doing things which was on a different spectrum all together.I was running the Seafood dept by myself as all clerks quit and ended up working split shifts.My dept suffered and new management wasnt willing to help or give me advice or support.
Safeway,1dh80pmb5b82g800,4.0,I used to work for Vons back in 2011-2013 I was quickly promoted to a Meat Clerk once I turned 18. If they would be paying me at least 17-20$ an hour Id definitely still be there.
Safeway,1dh7jndspb82g800,2.0,Working at Safeway could be fun at times
Safeway,1dh70vaml5j67800,4.0,I pilled orders and stack the pallets in a timely matter.When you get your order you have to get on a pallet jack and grab to pallets and completely pick all items on your list.
Safeway,1dh6nujce5nai800,3.0,Safeway was my income for a long time and it helped take care of my family. Many friends were made with this company who I still communicate with in some way.
Safeway,1dh6ljvtib86a802,1.0,It was a good high school job for a little bit. I really regretted working at Safeway overall though. When I got into the produce department the manager who btw was probably the best manager I’ve had  and the team made it much better I’d give them all 5 stars but it really wasnt worth the pay and headache. If you’re a courtesy clerk you’re  basically chopped meat. They don’t treat you well.
Safeway,1dh5r8152h420800,3.0,Safeway was an OK place to work the managers were not very knowledgeable of their jobs or how to get task done in a timely manner. learned a lot about managing a department under tight time constraints and the workplace culture was okay.
Safeway,1dh5q9h0bh3j2800,3.0,"they need to have a more relaxed atmosphere, have more youth working and that the gossip is strictly prohibited."
Safeway,1dh5hkgk4b82g800,1.0,"Started working for this company at age 16 as a courtesy and ended up in pharmacy. Worked most positions in the store such as checker, customer service and floral. Retirement was terrible but health benefits were reasonable. Typical corporate situation..never enough help to keep up work load and no organization. I dreaded coming to work everyday. Good place to start out and I learned a lot but move on!"
Safeway,1dh4pcgdm0kbg000,2.0,"Minimum wage offered and no benefits.  Only hire part time but then call you into work and change the schedules frequently without telling you.  So you end up being ""on call"" 7 days a week besides working particular days.  Since I worked night shift I didn't know when to sleep.  My boss was nice but very stressed out.  Once I met the bigger boss, I understood and felt bad for him.  People I worked with were nice though and very hardworking.  Company and bosses were not very accommodating.  One of the middle aged women had really bad rheumatoid arthritis and they wouldn't let her switch from working in the frozen section."
Safeway,1dh4ioviib86a800,3.0,Whenever I got this job they offered me weekly pay. That wasn't the case for the Vons I worked at. The managers were always too busy to give me my check for that week. Working at Vons taught me that you need to be pushy so that people will listen.
Safeway,1dh48erach3lg800,4.0,Fast paced throughout store
Safeway,1dh47f7plh3lg804,4.0,"Other than the fact it is a mandatory union job (which is illegal to fire someone for in the state of MT), it was a great job. The manager and other people were nice, and the hours were very flexible with school."
Safeway,1dh3re53hb86a802,1.0,The work enviroment is created by a poor management team people base on their needs and numbers they have to make. Lack of trust from management is a big issue. Courtesy clerks have reported to be looked down from managers also.
Safeway,1dh35fojgb863800,2.0,The workplace morale has been down with a lot of employee turn overs lately and issues with management. Overall the culture will always be a family. I love my co-workers to death and probably wouldn't make it through my shifts without them.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dh2edubjh3hq800,5.0,"The days of a cashier can be rather repetitive, but the people working at a store can make break it. Once 5 o'clock pm rolls around it gets busy, which makes the next two hours fly by. And I've never had troubles waiting on an increase by the management team."
Safeway,1dh21ofe4b89j802,1.0,"Nothing gets done unless you contact the Union Rep or HR about whatever your problem is. I worked at Safeway for 4 years. I practically ran a department on my own but when the opportunity for them arose to give me a raise and put me in charge, they ignored it.  There were conflicts between workers in my department and I brought it to management's attention, they ignored them too."
Safeway,1dh1mda0f52v0800,5.0,This is where I learned to cut fruits and do produce at. I enjoyed it! Cutting fruit killed a lot of time and I learned how to restock at Safeway too.
Safeway,1dh0iuafpb89j800,2.0,The pace was always fast. If there were no customers than there are a hundred other things that must be done. The training was minimal and through computer simulations. Managers are rarely easy to find. Schedules are ever-changing and minimally discussed with employees. The hardest part of the job was that coworkers didn't look out for each other. They were angry all the time and most were pretty half-hearted about working there at all.
Safeway,1dh0a75e6brdq800,5.0,"If you are looking for a job right away grocery stores are perfect for you. I personally didn't like the unfair treatment managers showed towards certain employees. I managed to work my way towards a lead position without sucking up but unfortunately most will not. It was a job, I got a check every week and I knew it was only temporary."
Safeway,1dh09jskib89j800,4.0,I make coffee and clean and talk to customers. I learned how to be fast on my feet to multi-task. I also learned how to be patient and how to listen. management is good.
Safeway,1dh02ul0ub89j800,3.0,"Good work environment once I worked there long enough. It was a tough road on the way up, though. A lot had to do with management.  Some were great. Some not so much."

Safeway,1dgvsq50352v0800,1.0,"I started out as a deli clerk. ""Promoted""(MOVED) to bakery clerk then to cake decorator because of my skills. Still no pay raise. I worked thete from 2012 to 2015. Aspired to be a bakery manager given the fact that i literally did EVERYTHING. Down to ordering, inventory, baking, cleaning, cake decorating, packing out to cases. As still no promise of more money. No raise. The merchandiser kept promising she was going to make me bakery manager and it never happened!!!"
Safeway,1dgvhjr3ob863802,3.0,I loved my job at Safeway regular customers and awesome coworkers I'm still friends with to this day. It's a fun fast paced work environment with great people.
Safeway,1dgvadfmih41q800,5.0,"work in produce was very self sufficient, management was very hands off so you made your own schedules which were usually from 2-11 am. Teamwork and communication were a must as was personal accountability"
Safeway,1dguqgm6vb89j800,1.0,"Been there 7 years need to move on, not the the same company I started at age of 16. Employees over worked, creates negative environment. No work/life balance."
Safeway,1dgsr7p4rb85o800,3.0,The job was very hard working. A lot of lifting and stocking to perfection.  Thats when i realized i wanted to go back to veterinary medicine were I am meant to be.
Safeway,1dgsr2brmb899800,1.0,"They treat team members very badly , especially dept managers.  Every week I was told what a bad manager I was even tho sales were up and the department was on point.  Nothing is ever good enough . That's why I stepped down"

Safeway,1dgr7nbe9h44v800,2.0,"Extremely stressful, never enough technician support because of labor model.  Management from store side usually did not support pharmacy.  Hardest part of job was balancing all the demands from being the only pharmacist.  The most enjoyable part of the job was developing lasting friendships with the customers."
Safeway,1dgr0r451b899800,5.0,I was hired by VONS as management trainee. I was trained in all areas of customer service including cashier.

Safeway,1dgnnnt1bh44v801,1.0,I worked at Safeway for a year as a GM stocker. I recieved one 10 cent raise throughout my employment despite going out of my way to learn and complete tasks that weren't in my job description. Raises are NOT based on merit. Instead you get an extra 10 cents every 1000 hours worked. Which for a part time employee would mean a raise every 50 weeks or so. Essential giving you nothing at all for the entire year
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dglm08q552tu800,3.0,"The job was cool, it was a job. I had to push carts, put back groceries, and clean bathrooms and mop floors. Managers were good when I worked here. I had to stop working here for school."
Safeway,1dglibvhqb899800,1.0,"I was the lowest of the low, having to count gross tobacco chew bottles and clean the bottle counting machines. It wasn't that great of a job. I felt like low level staff and was treated as such"
Safeway,1dgkvebrnh3p4800,3.0,"Worked typically 10+ hrs. a day. Loved my job until new managenent. I felt i was head hunted until they let me go.i would set all weekly displays on tuesday. I would process payroll, time and attendance."
Safeway,1dgjvfaj2h3l0800,2.0,"Associates were great to work with, job wasn't hard if management didn't micromanage and cut hours to a minimum. You were expected to do three people's jobs especially if they knew you were a good worker and 98% of the time were treated as if it wasn't enough and next time it needs to be done quicker. To Management you were replaceable. Take it or leave it....atmosphere"
Safeway,1dgjl9jmpb899800,3.0,Working for Safeway was my first job. Love/ hate relationship. I was work-hungry and worked my butt off for them. Management seemed to lack respect for their employees and the days seemed long and stressful.
Safeway,1dgjl5casb81r800,4.0,"The workplace itself can become a bit stressful, however you do have to maintain your end of the job. It is easy to become behind when not staying focused."
Safeway,1dgjjatdebrdg800,5.0,"Safeway is a great place to work and by far my favorite job. My managers were wonderful and always helpful. The only downside was limited hours, I averaged anywhere between 20 and 35 hours (usually around 23-27). I enjoyed my coworkers and it was a nice, chill job. I wanted to move somewhere else and based on my hours, was hesitant to transfer because I was afraid of not making enough for my bills. Other than that, I love my time at Safeway and I think they're a wonderful company. 10/10 would recommend."
Safeway,1dgiorv7ub899800,5.0,"working with meat is really cool, i enjoyed cutting and serving meat products. working inside of a refridgerator is odd and became unhealthy for me in the summer time."
Safeway,1dgimh1r352tu800,5.0,I like working at Safeway because I started working in the frozen department and that in end up at Customer Service you can reallyExpand your career at Safeway
Safeway,1dgii723pbrdg800,1.0,Company morale is very bad. They don’t value employees as family or friends. Just another body they can shuffle in and out
Safeway,1dgigmoq2h44v800,1.0,"A typical day at work for me was that as soon as I walked in I was being told 6 different things I needed to do immediately, while at the same time I needed to serve customers and clean up the mess left behind by the employees prior to me, especially my manger. A majority of the time I can't get done what is asked of me because I was the only one scheduled for counter help and closing, however the most enjoyable part were my coworkers that I was friends with."
Safeway,1dgh3u8srbrco800,5.0,As a courtesy clerk there was plenty to do but you worked as a team and it was very fun and competitive at the same time. The only thing that sucked was the parking lot in the summer.
Safeway,1dgh1s4c8brco800,3.0,Was a good company to work for. The people were nice and always helpful and would teach you anything you wanted to know. The customer service was great very organized.
Safeway,1dggkpl69b811800,2.0,"Way to much expectation that never ceases to stop. Never will you be good enough for the store manager. No real job culture, high turnover rate and severe lack of training."
Safeway,1dggg8krfbrco800,2.0,They treat you horrible lack of respect and compassion they don't understand you and the hours and pay suck definitely not a worth while job management uses their title to one up their employees
Safeway,1dgg7k30c52ss800,3.0,"My typical day at work consisted of working 8 hour shift in the produce department stocking shelves. Being in produce forced me to also learn cashier, I am called whenever up front needs help checking customers out. It is rather annoying how much times I hear my name being called for help. Being called up front also prevents me from what I am really supposed to do which is produce. On top of that my coworkers can be rather lazy sometimes, including the manager, and I am to pick up there slack, which isn't fair to me. Also I am closing in the department so I am do do all the closing stuff on top of what I have to get done already. The hours they give you here are set, you either have morning, or evening shifts, there is no middle unless the department has the hours they can give. 2 People working in the huge department daily is rather messed up, especially with being called up front a lot. I would only recommend this job to anyone who has good work ethic."
Safeway,1dgg506egb811800,2.0,Safeway culture at the stores I have visited and worked at is kind of like a chronic state of depression. Everyone is getting paid the bare minimum regardless of their skill and ability. Those that go above and beyond normally end up just doing more work while those just barely scraping by receive little to no consequence. Since the job also has a high turn around it is very likely to have to work shifts understaffed and/or with untrained co workers.
Safeway,1dgg2t2m824fe001,5.0,"Produce Clerks work in grocery stores where they are responsbile for customer service and stocking.

Safeway,1dgdde4msb88n800,1.0,"If you are young they have no problem working you into the ground so the older ladies can do what they need to though in the same hand when you need hours, you come second to the older employees. If someone calls out you're guilted into staying or you feel like youre going to get in trouble which probably wasn't the case but it felt like it with all the gossip."
Safeway,1dgb64on7brcm800,3.0,This is a very stressful place to work. They expect too much out of one person. They don't hire enough people. They do offer paid vacation after a year of employment.

Safeway,1dgb1g4oob84k800,1.0,Thought it was a full-time job but it goes by seniority so I mostly got less than 30.

Safeway,1dg5teiaab88j800,4.0,"Overall I liked working at Safeway, partly because I had a good manager who was helpful.  You have to be flexible as you only know your work schedule a week in advance.  Some of workers were negative so I worked to keep a positive attitude. But most of the employees at the store I worked at were helpful and worked together well."
Safeway,1dg5sjh41b80v800,5.0,I was always faster then everybody there. I tried to help my former employees anytime they needed it. Working at Safeway was very fast paced because I made it self paced.
Safeway,1dg5i0buk5ncl800,4.0,Your average grocery store job pretty fun place to work and decent staff the managers are a bit strict but that is to be expected. The pay was really low though
Safeway,1dg3unse1b80v801,3.0,"When I was hired at Safeway, It was to take hours away from employees in need of benefits. High school and college kids were brought in to pick up the extra hours, increasing the all-over turnover rate. It left long-term employees at a loss and put a lot of responsibility and stress onto those trying to make a living. The management was overworked, my manager was constantly tired from managing a large group of people day-in and day-out. Really broke my heart."
Safeway,1dg3qb0310mtf000,4.0,"As I manager there I can say that they were lacking in many ways, and I would've done things differently. for example, I would take customer recommendations seriously. I would also value the employee's we have and make sure they're comfortable with they're jobs."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dg3ipnhf52sp800,1.0,"Management was terrible, there was absolutely no communication. I had to go through multiple people for the answer to one question. Important information was not relayed to higher management, and managers really showed favoritism."
Safeway,1dg3div8gb84k800,3.0,Starting out it was a great place to work. However as my duties grew the support to get them done would drop. Other associates would leave messes over night to be cleaned up by night shift or early morning employees with no consequence. Unfinished duties would be left until the next day at expense to customer experience.
Safeway,1dg1nautq24f4000,4.0,Working at Safeway is challenging. The Safeway I worked at was a union store so there were a lot of guildlines to follow. As the Front End Manager I tried to make it fun. We would have contests when it came to fund raising. It is important with a front end job people understand they are more than just a cashier or courtesy clerk. I always wanted the cashiers to feel appreciated as their job could get stressful
Safeway,1dg1f9hs21d0e001,3.0,Disengaged upper leadership. Entitled hourly employees that didn't want to work any harder then the minimum. cycled through supervisors regularly due to stress and upper leadership. Just wasn't worth the stress.

Safeway,1dg0b94661fds000,4.0,"As a employee for Safeway it's been nice working for them .but also been stressful I have felt unappreciated as I have been deli trainer for 7 months in the past and never have I got employee of the month others that I've trained got it 2 of them .And as I moved to day stocking a girl that I trained in a month of that she was awarded employee of the month in August will be my 2 years with them and I'm just ready to possibly start a new path for myself. I do alot for Safeway from helping in lots of departments like deli ,floral, cashiering, day stocking., and recently helping bakery out. 😔 iam a mother of 3 and work my hardest to feel this low ."
Safeway,1dfv8ugbk24f4000,4.0,"When I started at Albertsons, before we turned into Safeway, I was just looking for a temporary job to support me while I was going through school. I have been cross-trained in almost every single department there is at the store and each one has different skills that you need to know in order to do your job proficiently. Customer Service is the most important aspect of the store and to keep the customers happy! The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with my co-workers and having a good time. The hardest part of my job is often times dealing with stressful situations that arise."
Safeway,1dfv7u7le1d0l000,1.0,"Was pregnant and was being moved around to areas I wasn't legally certified to work in (without any training), tried to get me to move heavy shipments around regardless of my pregnancy and was overall just trained poorly for my original position as cashier."
Safeway,1dfu322430mt5000,5.0,Working t Safeway was a fun and learning experience. I've seen all types of people and always assisted the customer professional and friendly manner. I learned something everyday working at Safeway such as products customers would get and the diversity.
Safeway,1dfu26p9b24e4000,5.0,"As a deli clerk, I loved the opportunity to interact with different customers as well as the opportunity afforded to me to learn how to use different slicing and food preparation machines and utensils which greatly added to my skill set!"
Safeway,1dfscfm421d0h000,1.0,"I wanted to go back as a cake decorator. I was talked into being a manager. Then 2 months later transferred and demoted, not to a cake decorator but a baker.

Safeway,1dfq3188a1d11000,3.0,"When I started, prior to acquisition by Albertsons Inc parent company in 2014, Safeway was a great place to work with positive emphasis on customer service and improving customer and employee satisfaction. Work requirements were reasonable and the tools and resources available to employees for proper job performance were more than adequate. However, after the completion of the merger and integration of Albertsons Inc systems with existing Safeway infrastructure, there was a slow, but steady degradation of the support environment. Systems were modified (often reducing capacity or availability of tools for front line employees) or replaced entirely with systems that were poorly conceived and implemented. Upper management approved a series of changes to customer websites and apps which radically changed how the customers interacted with the sites (while never advising the customer that changes were coming, or providing information about the changes when they were put in place). Many of the changes were made with little (or in some cases no) information provided to Customer Support, so the customer's experience when they would call for assistance was often less than satisfactory, which increased employee stresses. During my last year, the emphasis for Customer Support changed from resolving the various customer issues on the first contact, to handling an increasing number of mandatory contacts each day. At the same time, procedures were changed to limit the actual amount of assistance Customer Support (in the Ecommerce section) could actually provide on many issues. Employee morale"
Safeway,1dfq0kl131d0h000,1.0,"i started working at SafeWay distribution center in July 1/2015 to May 30/2018 until they fired me it was very disappointing to me they never gave me a chance ,before they put me in a colder department i was doing ok"
Safeway,1dfp3i7vr1d01004,3.0,"Management was very nice but lazy in getting things accomplished. Store directors did not allocate night crew extra people or hours, due to shortages. They expected 2-3 people to do the job on 4-5 in the same time or less. Many of us worked 6 days per week and up to 11-hour shifts. If we tried to call out sick we were guilted into coming in. Senior employees in my position would frequently leave work unfinished for me to do because they ""felt"" like going home and used arriving 30 minutes before me as their excuse."
Safeway,1dfn428dq0mth000,4.0,"Job was fair for the most part, not enough employees working at the time I was there which led to me having a lot of hours with no in between day off time."
Safeway,1dfmtb1bg24eh000,5.0,Work life balance is amazing. Great culture. The company provides great benefits and time off. They provide holidays off and you can not worry about timber off.
Safeway,1dfmh4htf24e1000,5.0,"Depending on the schedule I worked (anywhere from opening to closing shifts), my general day as a courtesy clerk involved everything from cleaning up high-traffic employee use and customer areas, changing out frequently used garbage can liners, to front-facing and re-stocking select store aisles for easy browsing, as well as returning misplaced or non-purchased merchandise to their proper placements, and retrieving store use carts & baskets from around the store lot. I would also help train new employees in the same department to better acclimate them to the workings of the store, and occasionally I'd help out in the Bakery department with packaging fresh baked goods for display."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dflrlg9m0mth000,2.0,"The store manager at the time I worked there was a tyrant and made everyone feel like they weren't allowed to enjoy life at all. It made working there uncomfortable and not fun. The Deli portion I worked in was a large workload and not enough help. Starbucks was the same at times, especially with sales/promotions. Safeway was cheap with labor and made their employees suffer because of it."
Safeway,1dfkupbre1fdi000,4.0,A typical day at work consists of 8 hours of work with a 1-hour lunch break. The hardest part of the job would be pushing carts and taking out the trash. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you meet while working. Almost all of the other employees are kind and will help you immediately.
Safeway,1dfjvh2ej24fh000,2.0,"I worked at Safeway as a Food Clerk.  I cut fruit, and vegetables and packaged them for customers to purchase.  A typical day at work included cutting a large quantity of produce for two to three hours a day during an eight hour shift.  The immediate supervisor (Produce Manager), and lead food clerk were rude, and phony.  The workplace culture is unprofessional.  Teammates at this store squeal on one another to all levels of management.  The produce manager at this store demands the food clerks to use rotting produce to sell to customers.  I experienced disparate treatment by my immediate supervisor, and teammates.  The hardest part of the job was working with hostile teammates.  The lead food clerk, and immediate supervisor did not train me.  I had to improvise the process in order to do my job.  I enjoyed cutting, and packaging produce at this store because it was a low stress job."

Safeway,1dfih8e641d11000,5.0,I would recommend this company but for me personally I did not have a good experience I started in the bakery but moved to  Courtesy Clark and that's when I had a bad experience the manager was rude and called me into the office almost everyday
Safeway,1dfie6f1024eh000,3.0,"Cruddy inconsistent hours where you rarely get more than a day off in a row and consistently schedule your shifts only 10 hours apart.  In one of the most expensive county's in my state to live in, getting paid so low should be criminal.  Union dues, benefits (could be a good expense if you need the insurance), and taxes make your take-home less than half what you make."
Safeway,1dfhr65i81d0h000,1.0,If you want to sacrifice your entire life for a company that will fire you without a second thought and pay you for 40hrs  but expect 70+ hours a week then this is the job for you.  If you don’t want to have a regular schedule and work all hours of the night and be treated like a sl@ve.  If you are not sold already don’t forget that you have to babysit 100+  children

Safeway,1dfgrflqf1d0h000,1.0,"Since April of '19 working here has been a nightmare. New management is running the store into the ground while cutting hours, expecting more to be done in less time, and not communicating their expectations between other managers and employees."

Safeway,1dff52bo51fdi000,1.0,Managment was poor I began seeing more and more co-workers leave the job. Many others left the job as soon as they got in. The managment was overall poor always messing up my schedule. I provided them with my school schedule and they would schedule me poorly and blame me for always needing to fix my schedule even though I had talked to them many times about my availability
Safeway,1dff3tb9n1d11000,4.0,For people that like a fast pace work environment this is your place.  Sometimes you will have to rely on your time management skills to get certain tasks done.
Safeway,1dff33inq1fdi000,1.0,Main manager only plays the blame game. I worked harder than 2 people always. I have been even called a locomotive. Continually covered for my boss. She didn't even become a manager until I transferred from another store. I was ordering and covering for the week sales. I was terminated for what they said I did a no show no call. I had never even been wrote up. I called when I said I would my husband has been in bed for over 8 weeks and is in critical condition and they said they would work with me and then fired me liers
Safeway,1dfel5hu21d11000,4.0,"Safeway/Albertsons is a major grocery store chain.  They have been around for a long time and are a secure place to work.  You become part of a union, adding to the security."
Safeway,1dfei8hro1fdi001,5.0,I would help out with customers to their vehicles if they needed it. Clean up messes that need to be picked up and wiped down. Helping customers find the items that they need. It is a hard job because your working with a lot of customers. I’ve learned that helping out others would be good to be there for them.

Safeway,1dfco0qf9b89c800,3.0,"What I mostly did was bagging groceries, swept floors, and cleaned bathrooms. I liked the job at first, but as the months went on, I started to dislike it because of dealing with bad customers. But that's just my personal opinion."
Safeway,1dfc9rciqb832800,2.0,"Bad pay, terrible hours and no job security. the job I did was not hard, the manager was a moron crybaby and he no longer works there. great first job but not a career I would recommend."

Safeway,1dfc5kactb89c800,4.0,"This was my first job and it taught me a lot. The management, however, was constantly changing so there were times when I would do a job or task and it would be overlooked. There was bias or unfair advantages for certain coworkers while others were never given a chance to advance or grow."
Safeway,1dfc3t1o7b84q800,3.0,"Safeway could be a good place to work if they had better management and took their hiring process serious.  A lot of the people who were ""upper management""  didn't really consider themselves upper management.  They always went to one person who was never there to do his job.  A lot of arguments and conflicts occurred between employees that was overlooked but gossiped about.  The managers for certain departments weren't very professional.  They also have you sign up for part-time but give you a full-time schedule.  You aren't allowed to call out sick or if you have emergencies they deem not important.  They have a relatively young staff but only pay a handful of their employees that are over 60 overtime and they get double pay on holidays and weekends.  The union isn't helpful but they take $10-$11 from your paycheck every week.  Corporate comes in the store and that's when you see management get more active.  It's a sad place to work and I would never recommend this establishment to anyone I know."
Safeway,1dfbuon0jb832800,3.0,"a typical day at safe way sucks boring and a terrible job,i learned how to stock and cashier and do dairy ,management was not to bad the boss is a cool guy , the employees were not the friendliest  people."
Safeway,1dfbs5rbbbrdr804,2.0,"some of the management (store directors, district management) are inflexible and do not give consistent and complete information and direction to make a job a balance of productivity and positivity."
Safeway,1dfbk461tb832800,3.0,"As long as there is a culture that cares only about the bottom line being bigger than the previous year.  This creates a situation where every year large corporations want more done with less hours. This creates a loss in both quality and customer service ability.  This is why companies like Vons will continue to lose revenue while companies like Starbucks, who spoil their employees, will always have a higher profit margin.  That being said, Vons is a union position, and comes with great benefits. Also the schedules are somewhat flexible during the week.  You will work almost every weekend."
Safeway,1dfahc7v8b84q800,2.0,This is a good job but only 1 of the management team works with the drivers or personal shoppers..
Safeway,1dfagkftnbrdr800,1.0,The management is all over the place. I had to report to 5 different people all asking the same thing. I was forgotten a few times. Customers look at you like your the one who can fix anything and everything. There is not a lot of help and sometimes you have to do tasks that you did not sign up for.
Safeway,1dfa5aoboh461800,4.0,They try to be equal and fair. It was a great company to work for. I actually regret leaving. Once you leave the company it is hard to get back in like Baptist.

Safeway,1df9j6i3ph461800,3.0,"You learn the basics of having a job and the value of it while working here. You have direct public contact and you interact with a wide range of people. Management constantly changes and each manager has differing levels of experience. Some are great, others are still learning the ropes. At this job I learned how to maintain professional relationships. The hardest part of the job is difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of of the job is working with so many different people."
Safeway,1df9id0lub832800,2.0,Safeway originally hired me to work 30 to 40 hours a week. This continually changes and they have cut me down to 24 to 33 hours per week. With my experience in Grocery Retail it was hard to see if there would be a future or guaranteed compensation for a position that could take care of my financial responsibilities.

Safeway,1df96fus0h3i2800,4.0,People and staff are nice some not all. I'm there to do a job a leave. Not really interested in job talk so I stay out of it. I'm here to work not run a social experiment do your work and then chit chat but not before
Safeway,1df7omn395j5m800,5.0,"hen establishing goals, make sure they are meaningful. There should be value in doing a particular activity. Each goal must be relevant to the work you do each day and should be mutually agreed upon by you and your manager"

Safeway,1df5kp26ub85h800,4.0,I am proud that Safeway was my first job it taught me how to have a good work ethic and what it is like to have a job. it will give you an opportunity to see what type of people that live in your community. It will give you the opportunity to see how good your patience is. Working at Safeway has shown me just slight of a hint of what life is going to be like.
Safeway,1df5ib76mbrf4800,4.0,"This was my first job and it really opened my eyes to the responsibilities of a working man. I had to learn the store in and out to provide ultimate customer satisfaction. I also had to make sure the store was clean and organized in general as compared to the individual sections. the hardest part of the job, in all honesty, was go-backs. As it tested your knowledge of the store and how efficient you can work. But the most enjoyable part of working here, in my opinion, was bagging and helping the customers directly."
Safeway,1df52mb3nb83d800,3.0,Making sure displays and other sale items are full at start of shift. Providing superior customer service. Training other employees on providing customer service as well as employees interested in moving up.
Safeway,1df2n5ihk5j5m800,1.0,The management was absolutely dreadful. Store manager doesn’t have a single care about the workers or our concerns. There was no sense of teamwork. Bad wages for higher positions.
Safeway,1df1t750tb83d800,3.0,Start of day insuring shelves are fully stocked and if product missing tracking down as to why. Insuring all product ordered is accounted for and properly billed. Insuring all displays are fully stocked and properly priced. Having gone through six managers and various management styles made for difficult transitions. Dealing with a store manager vision and district manager vision was sometimes difficult as sometimes the visions were opposite. Most rewarding when I was able to find a compromise for both visions. Most rewarding for me was when customers complimented me on displays.

Safeway,1df1i8l4bh3hs800,5.0,Its a great place to retire. The people are great to work with. Management is very professional. Whenever I had problems on the job supervision assisted me with the tools I needed to fix them in a timely manner.

Safeway,1detl9q2ubrf4800,1.0,Management is always coming up with added work to be done and doesn't supply enough people to actually get the job done. The staff doesn't work as a team. All the work and the mess of four or five people is left for the single closing person. The pay is low and they would hire more PT employees instead of making more full time positions. The upper store management was always
Safeway,1dess76thbrf4800,2.0,Management accused me of defamation of character.  Not understanding or helpful in any way.  Lead me to feel forced to quit. Made me choose between family and work.

The most enjoyable part of the job is, that you get to meet a variety of clientele."

Safeway,1depoo8o9b81g800,1.0,"Terrible place to work. Low pay, virtually no benefits if you're hired as part time and, that's virtually everyone.  I observed half the workers stood around, and the other half were forced to work at a feverish pace to support those not doing anything. If you took a sick day off, to get paid you had to get a doctor's note indicating you are sick.  So in essence you had to pay to see doctor to get sick pay.  You are forced to join a useless union that basically just backs the store. The company insures itself so it's policy is not to stop thieves.  People come in and just take whatever they want.  The company refers to it as shrinkage. So to make up for the loss they ""Steal"" or keep the employees at bottom rate pay.  A lot of the buddy buddy mentality. If a customer wants a free cup of water, they can have it.  If an employee takes a paper cup for water without paying for it-they are fired."

Safeway,1depj5crqh3hn803,4.0,I enjoyed working at Safeway. My job was stressful and dangerous at times but I felt like I was making a difference in the Stores by preventing those who steal from leaving the store. The pay was decent compared to other Asset Protection positions in the Denver/Aurora area. This job proved to me how patient I am. Dealing with combative shoplifters can take a toll and you need to have the ability to remain professional even when the people you are contacting are not.
Safeway,1dep945rnbrdo800,4.0,A great place to work at learned how to work with many different people how to rotate dates making sure all customers got fresh products. Management worked well and understands when you need to take time off.
Safeway,1dep6spaub892800,1.0,"My low ratings for Safeway was due to my last manager who was just completely disrespectful, inconsiderate and uncaring.

Safeway,1deo022h7h3l5800,3.0,"My experience has been mixed. Its a few blocks from my home so commute is a non issue. I cannot speak for the main store and how staff are treated, but for fuel stations it feels as though you are not an actual employee, the area I work at has an upsurge in violent crime and no security checkups are even a priority. Any issues concerning numbers or supplies are limited and at the convience of the people working inside. Management only comes out to issue write ups or a half hearted update."
Safeway,1denlrigm1d0o000,3.0,"Safeway was a fun place to work but the overall management was poor. My manager was stressed to pull product and sales with little resources so that in itself stressed everyone working there. The workplace was fun for the first few weeks but quickly grew stressful and overbearing. My recent position with them left me running the department completely by myself with almost zero training. As I said, management was a sham and it left no place to grow."
Safeway,1dendtaeu1d0o000,4.0,Large amount of problems arose but were easy to solve as a team. The ability to overcome and battle through tough situations came easy with the crew I worked with.
Safeway,1dem4ddvpbrcp800,3.0,"You put stuff back on shelves, bag groceries, clean bathrooms, take out the trash, and mop up after kids dropping milk on the floor every other day"
Safeway,1dem0evfo1d0o000,3.0,"I’m so sad to read about all the bad experiences others have had with Safeway home delivery. My and I have used this service for several years with a 98% positive outcome. Maybe it is due to our weather. Safeway delivery saved us many many times and we rely on their good service since we retired and have more than our share of bad days. Good luck to all of those living in cold climates, we retired here from Missouri and completely understand the difficulty of delivery issues in the winter months. Thank you Safeway for making many of us very happy."
Safeway,1delrfk6mb83o800,3.0,Need to play the politics game. Your work doesn’t really show much when it comes to who you know and how you are able to please the person to move up. Doesn’t matter how hard or good you work it just matters how good you can please the person above you.
Safeway,1deli3drph3l5800,3.0,Safeway is great place to start working if its your first job. You really learn a lot about customer service. I Would recommend safeway to anyone who is interested in working in a market.
Safeway,1deiu4vhdb83o800,1.0,"I was an assistant deli manager. As a deli clerk, the work itself was easy to learn. Unfortunately, I had a lazy, unorganized manager. I'd come in to supervise for the day and he wouldn't grab the frozen load or he forgot to order chickens AGAIN. I felt as if I were his babysitter, always picking up after him. I brought it up to the store manager and he told me it was ""my job to help him"". In my opinion there is a difference between helping him and constantly doing his job for him. Somedays I would be drowning in backstock other days I would barely have enough product for the day."
Safeway,1deiohcsbbrcp800,2.0,"Safeway does not care about their employees. They step on your throat just enough so that you can breathe. A typical day in the meat department. You would have 12 hours of work with 8 hours to use. We would never have enough people to properly maintain the case. You can look at it this way. Look at the lines at the registers. They never have enough people working the registers because Safeway wants to cut the cost. Yet the employees get rebuked for having lines. You never leave Safeway with a ""Good Job"" from your store manager. It was the single most miserable job I have worked."
Safeway,1deimc38kb8bt800,3.0,"Most coworkers are very nice and easy going. This job is hard on your feet since you're standing in one spot all day, at least there are mats though. Closing sucks because you have to refill front end fridges even though it isn't technically your job to and you have to find time to do it even when it's super busy. Very repetitive gets boring quick. there's an employee discount but you're not really saving anything because everything is so overpriced. discount is 10% Safeway bands and 5% on the rest but it is combined so you save like 50 cents."
Safeway,1dei36ks9h3st800,5.0,It was so much fun working with the people. Getting to meet special people each day. Then working hard to the point of healthy weight loss. Management always lended a listening ear.
Safeway,1degrhd8th3p9800,3.0,"great company to work for ,but.union I dont particularly care for. Benefits you have to wait a year to get which I did not like due to the fact that i am diabetic"
Safeway,1deg98u1jb8bt800,4.0,It was a decent overall medium wage job only problem was some of the regular customers and poor equipment to work with. My Co workers and superiors were very professional and understanding
Safeway,1deg7hucqbrcp800,5.0,Working for Safeway was a good experience for me calm and sometimes stressful but that happens in this type of business. There were a lot promotions available.
Safeway,1defh5nnn5nek800,4.0,Family member was sick and they didn’t let me take off I told them the person can pass away they didn’t care so I had to leave this job when it’s was time for me to come back they didn’t let me because I so called didn’t have doctors paperwork:
Safeway,1def8patfh3l5800,5.0,"Very long days and hard physical activity.  Started as a cashier.  Was promoted several times.  Became the Pricing Coordinator.  Worked with all store pricing, and inventory.  Assisted with Loss and Prevention.  Left to relocate to Tulsa to take care of Elderly Mother."
Safeway,1dedsu90bb8bt800,3.0,"I understand they are just trying to run a business, but the Vons just off of Broad has unfair leadership and the Union being a requirement kind of sucked. All in all, the working was alright, but they treated me like garbage."
Safeway,1deddd2joh3l5800,2.0,"Perhaps I'm just critical about the retail industry, but I was concerned with career opportunities once Albertsons bought out the company."
Safeway,1debufnql1d0o000,5.0,"Pulls the strength out of you, because you literally stand in the front of people staring at you for 8 hours. It takes that monkey off your back and gives you a back bone. It never puts a strain on you because the intent of the job is too be pleasant to others so that they may enjoy a great shopping exoerience."
Safeway,1debdirr9b83o800,5.0,I like busy work so i could be more productive. Also willing to learn more and new skills. I enjoy working with customers and also I like to get along with all my Co-workers.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1deb7d9td1d0o000,4.0,"The Safeway in my town was near a university, so a lot of students worked there, including me. They were very flexible with employee availability and understanding when it came to leaving for the summer, etc."
Safeway,1deb6a8811d0o001,3.0,The managment there was really stressful and strict. One of the managers didnt let you talk to the rest of the employees. Another manager was really mean and he would verbally abused me telling me the was lazy and would yell at me in front of costumers.
Safeway,1deau7vkg1d0o000,5.0,I really enjoyed working at safeway. We worked as a team and everyone got along. I hated having to leave because I loved going to work everyday and I loved the people I worked with.
Safeway,1deattk8gb8bt804,4.0,"You learn to be very calm and reasonable with people.   There is never a dull moment on the job site. The most enjoyable is closing laugh out loud, and sometimes you get a customer that has a sense of humor."
Safeway,1deakc3dq52u8800,1.0,"they would give you low hours to work, work you like a dog and expect you to work late nights and turn around and come back in the morning. Pay is horrible for the amount of stress you have to indure"
Safeway,1dea5ul8l52u8800,2.0,Need more hours and better management. When dealing with customers they'll always get what they want and you get reprimanded for any and everything even when its not your fault.
Safeway,1de8s518rb8bt800,3.0,"Safeway will give you the tools you need to further your career but nothing else. Learn all you can, and then move on as soon as possible. Be sure to not burn bridges, these will be helpful to you in your next position."
Safeway,1de8bpj281d0o000,4.0,"Hard, stressful work, understaffed, no communication really. I like who I work with for the most part. Bakery manager doesn't really seem to care too much about his job or who works with him. Store manager is pretty chill and awesome"
Safeway,1de88ufmmb8bt800,1.0,"Multiple health and safety violations were broken at my store. I got food poisoning multiple times from drinking milk from my store that I purchased and brought home. dairy room door open all night, clock hit the red gauge and went above, meaning the milk and other dairy products were at a warm temp for 8+ hours every night. No enforcement of people in packaging/ baking departments to ensure they are washing hands, wearing hairnets, using gloves, multiple times food in bakery was dropped on disgusting floor and then picked up and baked. a close friend worked a local Safeway and had the complete opposite experience. Customers shouldn't deal with those conditions."
Safeway,1de81ni4kb8bt800,1.0,I didn’t enjoy working their at all I was a manager only lasted 5 months because every time I wanted to take a weekend off the store manager had a problem.If you like working long hours and no time off and horrible pay work here I wouldn’t recommend this place to my worst enemy.
Safeway,1de7mgopl1d0o000,1.0,"they realluy sucked with schedules,,, hours,, or anything lol.. the manager was lazy and didn't help much which Is probably one of the reason the store closed down"
Safeway,1de6nki5sbrcp800,3.0,I like my job like and get along with most co workers and customer. It's not the easiest job but it didn't make working there undesirable. Hold your own and improvement can allow for advancement
Safeway,1de6e9j13b83o800,4.0,The job consisted of ensuring that items were scanned and bagged properly while maintaining a comforting atmosphere for the customer. I've learned to focus on getting single tasks done proficiently rather than attempting to multi-task constantly to get quality work done. Management was very friendly even when situations got stressful. The whole workplace had a very welcoming attitude. The hardest part of the job was being under pressure during certain situations. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a nice flow at times during transactions.
Safeway,1de5ut0p9h3l5800,3.0,"While it has been well over a year since I have worked at Safeway, from what I remember, A typical day at work normally consisted of: attending carts, bagging, checking products and prices for customers, serving customer needs, running the register (at times), returning unwanted products to shelves, facing products throughout the whole store, restocking dairy products and drinks, collecting and throwing all trash at the end of the night, cleaning and restocking bathrooms, cleaning spills and other possible messes, and providing carry out service. While the work was often overwhelming and the pay wasn't really worth the hassle, especially in the case of being the only Courtesy Clerk for a closing shift, it taught me the importance of efficiency and prioritizing. I learned a lot about how a fast-paced work environment functions on micro-management, and this job taught me the leadership and efficiency I needed to get ahead as a student manager in my current work-place."
Safeway,1de5iokbqbrcp800,5.0,"Hours are very inconsistent, but other than that the job and coworkers are great. Diverse group. Would defiantly work there again but only for better pay and better hours."
Safeway,1de5ftqc9b83o801,3.0,All decision making was taken out of the hands of store management. Corporate managers were making all business decisions for each store. This lead to lots of frustrations.
Safeway,1de5cd3n0h414800,5.0,"have to have excellent customer skills here you deal with a lot of people on a daily basis, customer skills a must if you want managers to like you, loved it"
Safeway,1de53jgabh3st800,5.0,"it was a nice place to meet new people. Things were hard for a while, but once you get to be there for 2 weeks you e the hang of it.Its a good place to learn more food and learn."
Safeway,1de3qr3k9brev800,4.0,"I was part time, so I do not know anything about the benefits."
Safeway,1de3hdqulb88o800,5.0,I was fired for insubordination during an arguement with the store manager. I wish I would have not got myself fired. Safeway is a good company and I miss being employed there.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1de3ehd3lb88o800,3.0,"Firstly it was difficult trying to even schedule an interview because the hiring manager only worked from 8-12am. The hiring process was about a month. Then finding out your hours for the week was such a burden because you had to physically go in to check it, you could only schedule time off at least three weeks in advance and even then they still schedules me. My coworkers were great but my manager was very pushy to say the least."
Safeway,1de38crfpb83o800,3.0,Courtesy clerk is a very good starter job for those who are just starting out. Opportunities exist for those who want to stay and schedules can vary depending on the time of year and time of day.
Safeway,1de370m6dbrev800,1.0,The sky falls and you feel like its a beautiful day dont let it get away. Youre on the run but you got no destination in the mud in the maze of her imagination yo ulvoe this town
Safeway,1de33umokb88o800,1.0,"By far, one of the worst places I have worked. The customer service desk was always busy, and no one there to help customers. Courtesy’s get stuck with monkey work. Ridiculously understaffed. No one wants to honor your requested time off, nor honor sick days without yelling at you. They do everything in their power to avoid workers comp responsibilities. I called in because I was in the emergency room and was told I should have thought of that before getting sick. You are yelled at for everything. Breaks were almost nonexistent. Maybe one towards the last hour of your shift. Ridiculously underpaid and compensated."
Safeway,1de23i3hu0mcq002,5.0,When I started working at Safeway it was a dream come true I finally was able to start working at a nice well job and apparently enjoy the workers there are all nice and everything I did about the job done I came back home and was relieved that I finally was able to start working for the first time and the experience was great
Safeway,1de14rmfpb88o800,1.0,"Where I worked use to be good, now everyone is all for them self and loves trying to get you fired and the managers don't care at all about it. The management does not care if you have doctors or jury duty or out of town they will threaten to fire you if you don't come in"
Safeway,1ddug96tub83o800,4.0,"Safeway is a good company, with a habit of putting unqualified people in managerial positions. I love my job but I make 10.80 an hour and my Union contract says im owed 11.50 but they havemt given me a raise since I started."
Safeway,1ddtvq3jcbrev800,2.0,I would recommend safeway as a work place for people who in school. I wouldn't personally work at safeway as a career unless you are a store manager or work in corporate.
Safeway,1ddtn86rmb84m800,3.0,"It is a good first job. But the company doesn't really care about its employees. If you just need a job to make money then I would recommend it but if you are looking for a job you are going to like, then I would look elsewhere."
Safeway,1dds8diud0mcq000,5.0,Good company high turn over rate. company never gives good hours; but a lot of good benefits if you work with HR; and lots of good employee discounts.
Safeway,1dds24ctj52t7800,3.0,I didn't like how they treated me as an assistant produce manger never did they want to promote me but yet they always wanted me to work as the produce manager... I left and never for paid for 2 months work as a produce manager...
Safeway,1ddrccd5vbrev800,4.0,Quick paced and energetic working environment with possible advancements and optional job role changes. daily work was fun with co-workers and friendly customers.
Safeway,1ddrc6vb7b84m800,3.0,Ok place not as good as Frys but would still work there if last option. Management needs a bit work but other than that everyone is friendly and nice.
Safeway,1ddr833pqb83o800,3.0,"Safeway was great company, but in the last 12 years it has gone down hill. They have no respect for the Employees and they show it by not paying them."
Safeway,1ddr74m6nh44g800,2.0,overall good first job nothing more. would only recommend as a first or temporary job other than that it isn't a place you want to stay long or as a career.
Safeway,1ddqqlad1b84m800,5.0,Great place to build a career they offer excellent pay with retirement and the strength of Union employment the benefits offered or exemplary I have not found another employer to be so generous
Safeway,1ddptriibb84m800,5.0,"It was my first job, I didn't know what I was doing. Had a panic attack the GM calmed me down and told me I was doing a good job. He was really nice, in the sincere way not the creepy way."
Safeway,1ddpmfgh5brcp800,2.0,This was my first fill time job and I worked as a Deli associate. Working the Deli was quite demanding and it required me to keep a clean workspace and deal with customers face-to-face.
Safeway,1ddpicsu9b835800,3.0,Heard so many good things but learned otherwise. Looking for new employment with a company that has opportunities and does not hold you back if they feel they need and depend on you more than another location does.
Safeway,1ddpbldseb835800,2.0,"As a student job during high school, Safeway was convenient and pretty easy but as a full time career, the environment was not conducive to collaboration and was completely disorganized causing me to miss out on over 80 hours of potential work."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1ddp8baarbrcp800,4.0,Greeted customers and directed to requested product; Cut and prepared seafood for sale; Packaged fresh sea food
Safeway,1ddov3br624e0000,5.0,It was nice to be able to work at all the companies or locally owned businesses I've worked at it seems that this world is so fast paced that there aren't very many familiar faces to really remember due to peiple progressing in whatever path they are pyrsuing and the short period of time that I did work at the Anchorage Safeway on Gambell I can say that if i were to be a part of a team or be lucky enough to be again I'm sure that it would be the same anywhere. But my overall experience working with who I worked with I notice is based on a team effort as is anything.
Safeway,1ddon2ggrb85e800,5.0,Working at safeway was like working at a speedway with how fast work had to move. We designed weekly promotion materials each week. I also project managed an outside agency as well with overflow work and demand for our team. We had tight deadlines to make and meet.
Safeway,1ddogvgsp24gh000,5.0,"worked here for over 7 years cutting meats in the meat dept. great benefits awesome managements and great opportunity for advancement, pay is good and ususally always hiring"
Safeway,1ddnvia31brcp800,2.0,dispatchers  play favorites even though it's a union shop. some forced dispatch. union representation is week.
Safeway,1ddnna700b89a800,5.0,"Fun working environment, I loved my co-workers as well as most of my customers.  The training is very useful and hands on as well not only computer training,  I loved that we got paid weekly.  The hardest part of the job was working the self-checkout because you had to multi-task.  You weren't only managing one register you were managing 6 at one time and sometimes when its busy it can become very overwhelming.  Especially on $5 Fridays.  I learned to always be on time and call 2 hours prior to your shift or they will terminate you."
Safeway,1ddmpj57pb835800,2.0,"Good people with little managerial leadership in the payroll department.  Have lost 10 processors in the last year, with no replacements.    I have not seen a promotion of anyone in the payroll department in the 3 years I've been here."
Safeway,1ddmdmg9ab85e800,4.0,"The people I worked with were wonderful.  I just didn't have an interest in working in grocery retail for the rest of my life, but I enjoyed it while I was there."
Safeway,1ddm8qqeqb85e800,2.0,Needs consistent management with a professional approach to lead a fully productive and fairly ran store with potential for success for all. Lacks positive energy throughout every department.
Safeway,1ddlm1dimbrcp800,1.0,The management there is very dysfunctional there and very rude. They don't contact you through text nor email or call you about your schedule? But I highly recommend you look somewhere else.
Safeway,1ddkaub5rb835800,4.0,Great place to work. Excellent training. I would strongly recommend this company. Honest feedback... I also think this survey is on the lengthy end and borders on annoying. Thx
Safeway,1ddji79h1b89a800,1.0,Management is always on your back. Always make sure you are doing exactly what you are supposed to do. And if you can’t this isn’t a job for you. So make you are capable of doing that.
Safeway,1ddjc6gcmb85e800,2.0,"They are nice in the beginning but as time passes they expect more and more from you, it feels like whatever you do is never enough. Manager tells you to do more and keeps changing your routine adding more work until it becomes to stressful to work."
Safeway,1ddj6kr5qb85e802,4.0,i really enjoyed working for safeway they taught me many things that will help me future wise and career wise. definitely would recommend anyone to work for safeway
Safeway,1ddj34jd224ej000,5.0,Safeway remains one of my most cherished work experiences. I really enjoyed the challenges that each day represented and most of my co-workers were world-class human beings
Safeway,1ddhsldkvb8bh802,2.0,This was my first job where it felt mundane and no chance of career advancement. I loved being indoors as much as possible with bagging groceries but pulling out the carts in hot temperatures and cleaning the restrooms was not something I was expecting. I learned more about blue-collar work and have a newfound respect for workers at grocery stores and supermarkets. The workplace culture seemed to be friendly but everyone kept themselves focused on their tasks.
Safeway,1ddhs0r2ubrf9800,5.0,Its based around communication skills and sense of urgency. Your never in one spot. You walk around the whole store providing help and guidance towards each individual walking through our doors. Co-workers and management very friendly. Satisfied with hourly pay and amount of hours given as a part time job
Safeway,1ddf5fq02b854800,3.0,If you young and looking for work experience and don’t need to support yourself it’s a good start or if you need a flexible schedule to supplement income from a different job however to management your are little more than a number on a spreadsheet they can replace you easily and won’t hesitate to do so there is little to no room for advancement so as soon as you get an opportunity leave for something better.
Safeway,1ddd91a2vb83u804,1.0,"DO NOT WORK AT THE DELI!! You get paid minimum wage but over worked. There is no TEAM EFFORT! So you basically pull your weight and others. Management is unprofessional. They have an ""IN"" crowd.. It's like being back in high school."
Safeway,1ddckjnb3b83u800,1.0,"I worked for this company for over 3 years. There is nothing positive about working here other than a steady paycheck. I was a full time employee yet was never guaranteed full time hours each week due to the store manager cutting hours consistently. The management does not care for their employees nor do they want to listen to any of the problems or concerns you try to share with them and will do absolutely nothing to resolve them. Department manager was not capable of handling employee conflicts within the department. Department was full of employees that only wanted to create conflict and drama between one another which made this place and extremely negative environment to work in. You will be overworked and underpaid, they expect you to do too much that you will never be capable of completing in one shift. You will be forced to work every holiday, weekend, and never get any time off unless you have years and years of seniority. Overall, this is a terrible place to work and there are much better opportunities out there than this company."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1ddcgvsg7brf9800,4.0,I enjoy working for a place where management are more involved and treat employees well.  So far management seems very helpful and knowledgeable.  I really like it cause we are represented by an Union.
Safeway,1ddc980jjb8ba800,1.0,"I’m considering leaving because of how awful it is. I got hired on the spot, and was never fully trained. Management doesn’t even follow company rules and talks about the employees they don’t like to the other employees. I am expected to know what to do without being told how to do something. Unrealistic expectations and poor treatment of employees. It’s very high stress considering I have too many responsibilities at once. I called out once for a medical emergency and was treated poorly after that. I do not recommend this job to anyone."
Safeway,1ddb8umfmb854800,4.0,Safeway is a good place to work but a more stable environment is what I need right now. I don’t like the inconsistency. You want to feel secure in a work place and that was not the case here.
Safeway,1ddb4u9o6h3j5800,4.0,I enjoy working at Safeway it’s a work place where i can focus and continue to work on my customer service skills. I really enjoy helping all types of races with any problems they might have to keep them warm and happy so they can feel free to come and shop again and always keep and friendly attitude and a positive vibe with everyone.
Safeway,1ddacertib854800,1.0,They were not fair to me therr and had me lift every thing heavy there with no help and i
Safeway,1ddaar7e75nb6800,3.0,"management is bad with scheduling and are lazy. pay was great and so were tips. overall not bad place to work, but was annoying at times. weekends are busy and more fun to work while week days drag."
Safeway,1dda502rhb854800,5.0,It was ok. I had some problems with verdigo but other than that I got to meet a lot of people and do a lot of different things. It was hard because of changings shifts all the time.
Safeway,1dd9snquhb83u800,1.0,"Typical day included doing daily tasks such as bringing in carts, bagging groceries, sweeping entire store, helping customers find items, and checking customers out."
Safeway,1dd9ktbn1b854804,2.0,Really poor communication all around. PIC’s don’t care about anything that happens and management doesn’t care about what happens. Your manager will just schedule you for a full week shift and expect you to do it. If I had a better manager I would stay just for the money but being around people that don’t care and carry so much drama to the store impacts how you feel and work at the store.
Safeway,1dd9kku2eb83u800,2.0,Like most retail its a lot of work for very little pay. Also they don't have very good work life balance. But it is at least consistent as far as day to day work tasks.
Safeway,1dd8us1k9brf9800,1.0,The only good part of the job were the other employee's that were my peers.  The main Manager was awful.  Training was insufficient with high expectations.  I hear from other employee's at other safeways that management has been a issue.
Safeway,1dd6jj5atb854800,4.0,"slow venue, not a huge growth opportunity , poor pay, no opportunity to grow, no advancement opportunity not a compatible pay, benefits are just ok. but not good"
Safeway,1dd6blajob8ba800,4.0,Was a decent place to work. Had three separate pay raises and advancements. If I hadn't moved away for college I probably would've been a mananger for Safeway by now if not running my own location.
Safeway,1dd6bj4g7b854800,3.0,"The Starbucks Manager position provided flexibility, but was very stressful. I enjoyed working with my hands and motivating others. Training could have been better, but learned to reflect and change from my mistakes."
Safeway,1dd65dfr5h3n6800,4.0,"Our store was understaffed where we only had 4 deli clerks. I tried to join as much as I could as it was a high school job. they treated me great and as a human. I worked there for a year and a half and left when our manager quit and was replaced, the union started taking 50$ a week and my fiancee was mad she never saw me. Great place to start a career just be ready to be turned down as I did."
Safeway,1dd5uq04h52vc800,4.0,"I liked working at Safeway, they have great perks and fun employee events. Fast passed call center. I worked in several departments and enjoyed each one."
Safeway,1dd5r49jo5nfd805,4.0,In order to be successful you must know how to work as a team to achieve all task. You must also have patience for customers. And always remember to be your best when you not your best.
Safeway,1dd5e0e4jh438800,3.0,Low hrs and bad pay. Union dues and no hrs to pay for it. You do get a small employee discount. If you get a lot of hrs it will be because they have a visit coming from head quarters and after the visit is done then so are your hrs.
Safeway,1dd50l8t8h3ql802,2.0,Work is stressful and hectic because staff is spread thin with no coverage but management demands more be met than the on hand staff can provide. Management hires too many people and then still schedules bare minimum coverage leaving everyone with not enough hours to earn a live-able wage for the area. Not given enough hours to qualify for benefits. Inhospitable management style also means that customer care is not a focus despite the company promoting that. Good employees leave and those who remain are mistreated.
Safeway,1dd4f5vvgh3uh800,3.0,Love my job. And thw people i work with as well. The break room is spacious and some of the employees are friendly. They ended up cross training me to work in different departments which gave me more hours.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dd2kj9e5b878800,3.0,"The workers around me were extremely lazy and did not care about their job. As a result, I had to pick up after them for everything that they didn't do, and after I told my managers about it they did nothing so I quit."
Safeway,1dd27dapabrdk800,2.0,"Job was just brutal, I remember. How hard I would work and I would feel like I got nothing done. It's a terrible. Feeling when. All you want to do is a good job. When this happens it gives you a give up mentality."
Safeway,1dd25sn51b89k800,4.0,They do value their employees but they over work them especially in IT.  They could do a lot of restructuring to allow for those not to have to work 12 hour days.
Safeway,1dd21cbb1b878800,2.0,I still work at Safeway for health benefits. It is very flexible and allows me to move forward on another career I am passionate about. I learned a ton of skills working for Safeway.
Safeway,1dd1lo8flh42k801,4.0,Management generally allows you to be very flexible with your hours ranging from working once a month to working upwards of 20 hours a week. Sort of clique-y but very easy to ignore.
Safeway,1dd17hatk5nao800,5.0,"Fun place to be as a worker, people come in and out of the store and give you plenty of good conversations to help the day pass. People were friendly."
Safeway,1dd15c1l0b89k800,3.0,"As a barista the responsibilities that were given; cleaning of kiosk, tending to customers drinks, taking out the trash, cleaning of all machines, and taking inventory of the food (looking at expiration dates). I learned a lot about time management because there were several tasks to be completed after closing. The toughest part about this job was being collaborative with some of the coworkers. The easiest part of that job was making drinks."
Safeway,1dd15blm8b878800,2.0,safeway had its up and its downs it was my first job in the retail field but it wasn't this best choice i ever made some managers were really cool and some where extremely rude i can remember a time my manager hired a brand new checkout clerk and she was making more than me based off the fact that she had more experience while i was working almost every department in the store and to top that my manager never even changed my job title when he promoted me he kept me as a courtesy clerk
Safeway,1dd0nj68752v2800,1.0,"Management  Was very poor at listening and trying to help employees. Never could get full time, been there 10 plus years. They have there favorites to promote."
Safeway,1dd007vs65j60800,1.0,"Management in the beginning was great but after the head-manager left, everything went downhill overtime. By the end of my time there, I was doing some of the management work while getting paid the same amount I made when starting as a cashier. I worked in multiple departments including dairy, frozen, floral, cashier, courtesy clerk, etc... but the pay remained the same"
Safeway,1dcv4hi14b8ak803,5.0,Fantastic first job straight out of high school and during college.  The hours were flexible and managers understood that it was a part-time job.  It was very much a family feel between veteran workers and the younger crowd.  It was a great way to learn the in's and out's of customer service that I carried over into all types of jobs.
Safeway,1dcv3r6rgb8ak804,3.0,"Working at Safeway for about eight months everyone felt like family. You never felt unwelcome by the coworkers. But as for the upper management, it was extremely hard to talk with them as they never set aside time for their workers, and nearly impossible to get raises even for those who have worked there for over five years."
Safeway,1dcukipnnh41t800,2.0,I worked for one year at Safeway cycling through various duties and titles and i can tell you it was quite possible the most stressful year of my life.
Safeway,1dcuden35h3q4800,5.0,Focused highly on superior customer service
Safeway,1dcu7tkc2b8ak800,3.0,I knew It was going to be one of my least favorite jobs in the safeway deli. It was the only place that would take me for the hours I was available and also for having been a stay at home mom for a long while. While I ended up loving the people I worked with I felt pressured to be super fast pace which I understand but there is no better pay than minimum wage and people expect you to pour your soul into this job. Not to mention I met a ton of people who were enslaved to safeway bc of their benefits. I felt the need to get out as I didn't want that to happen to me. If you have nowhere else to go and need to start at the bottom I recommend Safeway.
Safeway,1dct7d6j9b833800,3.0,The place was alright to work at. They were always short staffed and i was always getting called in on my days off which was annoying. But management wasn't terrible and it was a good place to work at for the most part.
Safeway,1dcsqjlgab833800,3.0,Safeway was the leader in customer service. The culture grew employees from within the company. The stores promoted a community focus. It has since been replaced with a bottom line financial focus that is destroying the best practices which was renowned for Safeway. The corporate mentality has removed the autonomy from the local managers. It has placed best practices in the hands of a group of people too far removed from each store to fully understand the effects of their time consuming paper pushing requirements.
Safeway,1dcscp8gqbrep800,5.0,"I really liked working for Safeway, the management was behind us employee's. The only reason I left was health issues with my son. I was sad to leave the company."
Safeway,1dcpk7j3sb833800,2.0,"Not a company I enjoyed working for. The managers weren't fair and they put family members working together. Safeway is a great place to shop for food at, but not work at."
Safeway,1dcnlb2m6brep800,5.0,Productive and professional workplace in which the employees were managed in a proper and prosperous way.  Customers were well treated and cared for.  Excellent benefits.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dcnje3eeh3hu800,3.0,"This is not a company to work for if you expect to live a lone or support a family. There's not enough hours the union is not very strong, there is a clique atmosphere,"
Safeway,1dcnc154a5j60800,2.0,"Although there are policies to protect employees management often finds ways around that. Of course every store will differentiate in professionalism, the store I work with lacks a lot of professionalism. The store I work at bids schedules based off seniority, meaning that the people that have worked there the longest get to choose first the hours they would like to work. If you are not interested working a variety of different hours (overnights, early morning, mid shifts, or closing shifts) this may not be an ideal place of employment for you. Full time positions are very hard to come by, only the most senior people are offered full time. When promotional opportunities become available, they use what is called manger's discretion meaning that even if you apply and you are the most qualified for that position, the manger can choose whoever they wish to fill it. The store I work for has a union which in a lot of ways is beneficial but in others is negative. You are expected to pay a union fee every time you get paid (automatically taken out of check) the most negative thing about working with a union is that it takes a lot to terminate an employee, even if that employee is unreliable or lacks work ethic. Positive thing is that you cannot be fired for something ridiculous and you are always able to dispute issues with management with a union representative."
Safeway,1dcn7toa0b833800,4.0,i enjoyed working there and i was glad they gave me the opportunity it was fast paced at times but also quite slow the co workers and managers were nice it was a very clean store
Safeway,1dcn7ikdfh3hu800,4.0,While I started working here there was a few bumps and bruises on the way because there were a few people that hated me on the job site but they didn't make me feel welcomed once I showed up. Once they got to know me and what I did for them a lot of them gave me perks and were more lenient with me in the workplace because I showed them I worked hard and was a happy go lucky kid. So I would say it would be a great experience to work there as a young teen but as You get older then I see it as a strict area and not a happy greeting place for you to work there.
Safeway,1dcmsrkm35na4800,5.0,"Safeway was by far the best place I have worked at. I had intended on staying in Washington originally, as I had already started school and seemed to be doing rather well for myself. However, personal and financial problems started popping up with a close friend of mine and I made the decision to move in with him in Virginia to help him."
Safeway,1dcladtjeh45m800,1.0,"I was a delivery driver and it was just kicking off in Houston. Management was a total joke. The routes were insane, and the work too much for 1 person. Not surprisingly it failed. Everyone was laid off."
Safeway,1dcl51gvah3q1800,2.0,Safeway is poorly run and employees are expected to work long hours while dealing with extremely rude customers. Management is also rude and often condescending.
Safeway,1dckngr25h3tp800,5.0,"•	Ensure quality control standards are met and maintained by performing line checks, code verifications, water tests, and recording documentation"
Safeway,1dckc6m9ph3hr800,3.0,"I learned a great deal of managing a pharmacy although due to lack of enough support from upper management, the experience was difficult. I also learned and experienced a lot customer service skills."
Safeway,1dcka6ip35ne6800,3.0,"I would recommend the positions at Safeway (Food and Drug), Inc. to someone who was a student. The typical day consist of a fast pace environment. I learned a great deal about cutting various meats with a meat slicing machine."
Safeway,1dck6j8cth3tp800,2.0,"good job to start at when you are young cause you can't do to many hours and you can only do one job. you will meet some good people at work. And try to be a on time person but do not think you will move up, they take there time on moving anyone up"
Safeway,1dck4h5eth41q800,3.0,It was a good place to work. Most of the people were great which made it a nice place to work. I worked there for a total of 12 years. I was able to advance quickly. The benefits we're good.  This plant is closed now
Safeway,1dcigl9cdb8ah800,5.0,"I loved my job great people, customers good invierment.very friendly great benifets tons of opportunity. Promotions, helping employees, and just a great place to work,"
Safeway,1dcif79stbrem802,5.0,It was really a fun caring helpful environment and they have great health benefits also it’s a beautiful thing that they work with your schedule to be completely honest
Safeway,1dcidfugn5n9v800,1.0,"Management is selfish, arrogant, racist, and biased. Even if you work as much as possible, you won't get any credit for it and will be treated like a piece of trash. Your only chance is the play the political game and pray that management doesn't already have it out for you, because otherwise you're not even given a chance."
Safeway,1dci8899hb830800,3.0,if you have nothing nice to say about safeway don't say anything about safeway at all.its a ok place to work if  your a student trying to make some extra money or a summer job.
Safeway,1dci33okab830800,1.0,"Clock in, scan items and provide good customer service. Not really an exciting job but it gets you through the day. Management is terrible, there's no communication from management to the employees and management will be negative if you bring up a personal issue. People who been there for the longest time, tend to gossip and spread rumors which affects the workplace and new employees alike. Breaks or ""lunch"" is pretty wild.  You will get one 10 min. break, if you work 4-6 hrs. and a one 15 min. break if you work an 7-7 1/2hr. shift. Which you probably don't have time to eat and use the restroom in that timeframe. If you go a couple minutes over, the floor manager will probably lecture you about going over your break. Above all, it's better to work somewhere different."
Safeway,1dci1brucb830800,3.0,"Like all corporations, Safeway treat their employees as fair as they can. Budget cuts are happening which makes it hard to keep up with all work and less help."
Safeway,1dch0dtrih45m800,1.0,"The lack of training made the job super stressful. There was no material/manuals to look back on when baking, if there was, I was never shown. I trained maybe 2 days before opening the bakery by myself. My trainer was always complaining that he would be done already. He taught me how to destress while he baked everything. I learned how to glaze stuff and destress. Nothing about bake times or how to tell what products are what."
Safeway,1dcgnh0u8brem800,4.0,"Starting was fun and easy. It was easy to pick up and learn. Mu team members taught quickly and efficiently. Each work day is different. Sometimes its fast paced, other times its dead quiet."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dcghhc9bbrem800,4.0,They call it slaveway for a reason. They often understaff departments and then apply pressure to staff that are scheduled. There is a lot of politics involved which creates bias on who will be promoted. Promotions not based on how many years or experience or dedication. I've witnessed a meat cutter who was there 5 years still being paid the current minimum wage. While a new person was hired 3 dollars over that rate. Should be illegal. Wheres the moral In that?
Safeway,1dcgb5tg052tq800,3.0,"Very fast average pace of work at my specific location, employees were very hard working, yet dissatisfied with their work. Sterile and uncomfortable environment."
Safeway,1dcgaum62b86k800,3.0,The biggest concern when working at Safeway depends on what kind of manager you have. I stayed for a while due to having a great manager that actually cared about her employees and gave us the time we needed off but I have heard many stories from friends where the managers are not all that nice.
Safeway,1dcg7icbfbref800,3.0,"Very friendly employees, management could not give a single care about you. no accommodations for health problems. break room has a freezer and a water jug that YOU have to pay for to fill. Hardest part is being outside in all black clothes in the heat pushing carts."
Safeway,1dcfurq6uh45j800,5.0,"My typical day would consist of coming in and erecting, dismantling, and modifying scaffolds as needed for other contractors as needed. I was a helper just getting into the plant life."
Safeway,1dcdddld4b81c800,3.0,Lots of picking up other people’s slack so you basically do your job and somebody else’s without really getting paid for it. Takes a lot for them to fire you.
Safeway,1dccjlu2db895800,4.0,i have both good and bad things to say about my time at safeway. for starters safeway is overall a good comapy to work for. all the employees get treated fairly and theres always room to pick up hours. Another positive is the weekly pay and union benefits. My only down fall while working at safeway was the store manager who managed the safeway that i specificly worked at i always felt as those she was out to get me i thought well maybe it was just me till i found out that other employees also had run ins with her and thats when i knew it was her and not me.
Safeway,1dcas89c8b858802,2.0,"Worked with some of the hardest working, responsible people,  great employees to have, but totally ignored by the company, maybe a letter from corporate or $5 gift card only if you were recognized on their surveys  Your dedication to your customers or the fact you showed up everyday on time for 20 yrs with maybe 3 call outs, stuff like that is of not worthy of recognition. I watched so many talented young people come and go because other than some decent medical benefits, there was no feeling that you were valued by the company. The break rooms were always a ghetto, just discouraging."
Safeway,1dcaksps3b858800,4.0,"Well first I do my distressed with tellzon gun. Then I work my back stock of bread and then my new stuff. Then I do my ordering for the bread and frozen. Then I work the hostess on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Then after lunch around like 9:00am I am up front bagging doing carts, sweeps, and go backs if there are any to do. There are like five mangers in the store throughout the day. One general manger and four assistant manger helping out throughout the day stocking shelf. In the workplace culture it is very fast moving, taskorengied. Just waking up at the crack of dawn to get the work day before the day starts. Get to work with my co workers that are very nice."
Safeway,1dcagh6emb895800,4.0,"Safeway has been an experience for me. It allowed me the opportunity to engage in customer service towards all customers. Although it was a fast pace of work, I enjoyed it."
Safeway,1dcacvvveh44m800,3.0,Poor management
Safeway,1dc89ros6brd9800,2.0,"The typical nickname that I began to hear about Safeway about 4 months into my job was ""Slaveway"", and I finally understand it. The employees are stressed to do so many jobs and there is very little help available. When I mentioned this to the management, there was very little that anyone did and it seemed as though nobody cared. While I know that the management in my store could be better, I know it is mainly corporate that is forcing all of these budget and hour cuts while demanding more be done. Overall, I think working at Safeway (despite the benefits and all that) is a bad idea. It was a great job while it lasted, but the company is NOT as good as it used to be."
Safeway,1dc899cakb895800,4.0,I was working at safeway for 2 years and I had to    re -locate for personal reasons. If I could stay at safeway I would go back as part time. I loved my job.
Safeway,1dc86cr3lbrd9801,1.0,Safeway was the worst job i have ever had. The management was poor. The hours were all over the place. The place was never cleaned and the employees were treated very poorly.
Safeway,1dc7sspmsb895800,2.0,You can't call in sick. Management will literally send someone to pick you up so you don't miss a shift if a car breaks down. They are not nice about it either.
Safeway,1dc7jq0c4brd9800,2.0,"Not a positive or encouraging environment. Management style is lacking support, positive feedback and adequate training. Minimal hours and pay rates are at a low level."
Safeway,1dc7j24jsbrd9800,2.0,"The manager is more concerned about his bonus than his employees, or that of his store. Poor professionalism and no regards to employee problems and continuely violates union policy."
Safeway,1dc7ijefib81c800,2.0,The job is really stressful and hard when low staffed constantly. Manager is not the greatest at their job.  Making you work alone for usually half your shift.
Safeway,1dc60j6eab858800,5.0,Union job full benefits employee's are nice. Corporate isn't great
Safeway,1dc5l4ojib895800,5.0,Worked with a variety of knowledgeable preceptors who taught me various aspects about the pharmacy profession. Welcoming workplace environment. The work day was fairly busy but manageable.

Safeway,1dc4r50uq5nck800,1.0,"very petty at the deli in pg plaza location, nasty attitudes, dirty work areas, disrespectful bunch, I would not recommend working there. I did not learn much from this location, however; the deli in the Bowie location was much better."
Safeway,1dc4jek5c5j4g800,5.0,They have different positions that help people if they don't know what area would be best for them. Most of the positions are about customer service .
Safeway,1dc3qjfde0kbt000,5.0,"I really liked working at safeway The job gave me association skills, Working at safeway taught me how to properly speak to customers. Plus it was an save enviorment"
Safeway,1dc3nvkegh44g800,4.0,"If you are 18 years old and like to work in fast-paced environments, then Safeway is for you. You meet a lot of wonder customers, and meeting coordinated time intervals are amazing."
Safeway,1dc3a3bnkb892800,4.0,"This was a unionized franchise, which I didn't appreciate that much, because I just needed a job. The typical day was on your feet all the time and doing labor that made you tired, scanning and cleaning, and whatnot. I learned a lot about time management and social skills. Being around people the entire time and helping them out, you need to work fast in order to make sure you are being as efficient as possible to get to the next customer while also making the previous customer feel taken care of. People had fun there. It's a grueling job but the people make light of it. It was fun to be there with a bunch of other people who understand. The hardest part of my job was being 18. I wish I had been older when I started there, I may have been able to climb the ladder faster. The most enjoyable part really was being around the people."
Safeway,1dc38nrkd24fe000,4.0,"The schedule was accommodating  enough that I was able to continue my education, but I definitely couldn't see myself there for a long period of time."
Safeway,1dc34sc3824et000,2.0,No more than 11.75 hourly (Colorado) no benifits besides being union till 3 months of being full time. Management can’t even pull out of dates none the less keep things running smooth.
Safeway,1dc32glnl0mtc000,3.0,They never work with you with scheduling .Unattainable goals.Never enough help.No communication.They do not teach you how to achieve their goals.Happy I left.
Safeway,1dc2c7b3424et000,4.0,"It is a great place to work because of good pay, benefits and room for advancement. It is a challenging environment that requires a level headed individual if you would like to be successful there."
Safeway,1dc2bin8bb855800,5.0,I've learned much over the years. This is a team player and customer service atmosphere.  A typical day Is high energy and high  demand.  It seems there is just never enough hours in a day.
Safeway,1dc226nju0mtt000,4.0,Good working place and working environment if you live close by tto the store. Get paid every week so that was also a plus. Nice managers and cool co workers.
Safeway,1dc2078mq0mcs000,1.0,"Safeway is a company that isn’t a fine oiled machine. The mangers are careless and only fend for themselves. Upper management isn’t organized so it shows In the stores ! Organization is very poor. They hire young for they don’t have to pay medical limited hours if your not full time , more part time employees for they don’t have to pay medical! There medical is at the bottom of the insurance scale."
Safeway,1dc0nacjnb855800,2.0,It was a fast paced environment with lack of employees . I always found myself being left alone when the volume picked up . I would not work there again .
Safeway,1dc0bqrk6brd2800,5.0,You clock in and start doing your work and you help people as you go about your shift. I learned how to be mown team player. The managament can be a lot better. The cultural is okay. Hardest part is you don't get a lot of help around you. Most enjoyable part is you work at your pace. Its not a very demanding job
Safeway,1dc08mke5b815800,2.0,"Been working there 8 months, now. Started out great, and eventually has become a waste of time. Tried applying for apprenticeship; however, employers didn't care, or take the time to help. I applied for specific position, then unknowingly was placed in another, making a much smaller wage. I worked my whole heart out, into my department and the customers, up until, I lost my motivation. There is no appreciation, or teamwork effort."
Safeway,1dc060dvsb855800,5.0,Loved every minute I was there! I learned so much and made great friends. Fast paced most of the time but I enjoy that. Makes the day go by so much faster.
Safeway,1dc05nkjhbrd2800,1.0,"Confusing place to work. Piled on insurmountable amount of work. Unclear priorities. Weird training methods. Strange co-workers, and management, and plenty of mystery shoppers/shill spies."
Safeway,1dc04fb1d24et000,3.0,Too many responsibilities for one person.
Safeway,1dbvtkda50mtt000,4.0,"Working at Safeway was good. It has an Union so you are guaranteed higher salaries as you continue to work. The management for  the most part was good, and they will train if you are interested in advancement."
Safeway,1dbvt2fgt24ft000,3.0,"I enjoy shopping at Safeway, but hated working there. When I worked for Safeway they were in the process of being bought out and everything was changing. Management was very touchy. I worked at a high demand location, so we were always busy which was nice. If I hadnt had the department manager that I had I probably would have stayed longer, but that person made it hard to work there, especially for her. I needed a change and left. Even though I had a poor experience doesnt mean I would want to ruin it for others. Not all locations are the same and they are under new management and a new corporation as well. Hopefully everything chamged for the better."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dbvq6d9624ge000,3.0,"I like the work I do, but in my experience it can be like going to high school. In the area I worked in there was a lot of favoritism, if you did a good job but wasn't popular with the group they moved you."
Safeway,1dbvi2qfe0mcs000,2.0,"The daily routines were not that bad. The manager always wanted more from me. We were always understaffed, which put more pressure on the clerks. The other clerk was lazy and unproductive. Other department managers and employees seemed very stressed and angry. The safety requests from the department i was in was always overlooked. The hardest part of the job was dealing with all the pressure the manager put exclusively on me, while assisting customers to the best of my ability and cleaning up after the other clerk. The most enjoyable part of the job was when a few other workers and I would let off some steam by talking and taking minor breaks."
Safeway,1dburj2thbrd2800,1.0,Extremely understaffed always. Managment is horrible and disrespectful.  Only guaranteed 16 hours a week. No sales= no hours... usually 4 hour days. Minimum wage with no benefits if you do not work 24 hours a week..
Safeway,1dbue7i3bbrcm800,4.0,"I've been with the company long enough that I know all of the ""veteran"" employees quite well. Maybe it's just a retail thing but if you last more than 2 years in retail you're considered a veteran. I have known all these people so long that it's almost like family."
Safeway,1dbu2png4brcm800,3.0,"Terrible management, they don’t properly train their employees. I work at a VERY high volume store & they’re constantly slashing hours. understaffed.."
Safeway,1dbtosiuob80n800,3.0,"I personally had a good time working there, but most of the management and customers made the job difficult from interactions to the management just not caring about you as an employee."
Safeway,1dbt7e3qrb80n800,4.0,I have been with this company for 9 years I have learned and had growth personally and professionally I had met many wonderful individuals on my journey.
Safeway,1dbt33jlgb88l800,3.0,i did learn good customer service skills. very fast paced and physical learning experience. hours were not as flexible as they could be. Some of the tasks were very hard to accomplish without help from others. Accommodations in this type of work would have been a little bit helpful.
Safeway,1dbrjidd0brcm800,5.0,Working ar Safeway is a stress-free job.  Employees receive benefits and fair hours.  Stores can range from fast to slow depending on the hour.  People do tend to steal so you have to keep an eye out.
Safeway,1dbrgqp9tbrcm800,2.0,It was okay until I transferred to another Safeway out of state. They forgot to put the transfer in. So when I got to the other state I had np job to go to. It was a nightmare . Thanks Safeway
Safeway,1dbpfstjqb84n800,3.0,Must be able to help multiple customers in a quick fashion. Will be short handed a lot and will need to be able to problem solve on your  own most of the time.
Safeway,1dbnrgagc24eo000,3.0,"Pay doesn’t match all the things they make you do, co workers are great and people become good friends, employee discount is sometimes helpful. The schedule is different every week; sometimes you’re screwed over with 20 hours and sometimes you get almost 40 hours. It just depends."
Safeway,1dbnp2cak24eo000,4.0,"A typical work day would be you coming in and clocking in. Get bags for the day, turn your light on at your register and you would normally wait for someone to come to your register. It does get a little stressful when it’s very busy especially during holidays and certain days and times. There are times where there will be really no one in the store so it gets very slow. The most enjoyable part of your job is talking to really nice people that you encounter. I do get for the most part a lot of pleasant people but I do get people that are rude as well. When you request off for days I would advise people to remind the manager because they may schedule you anyways."
Safeway,1dbmnjhcab84n800,5.0,The best job in the world . Able to relocate and do many new challenges to learn. Staff and management is above and beyond. Safeway “ Ingredients for life”.
Safeway,1dblhu5fi24f9003,1.0,"It doesn't matter if you've worked at Safeway for 1 week or 10 years. They don't value you at all. Even if you've worked hard, never say no, come in at a drop of a dime, always stay over, etc... They will not stand behind you and they will get rid of you if you're not important enough to them. Or if you dont fall into the right group. The higher ups who come into the stores, dont take the time to actually talk to any employee lower than management. They barely wave hello or introduce themselves. It makes you feel insignificant in a company who boast the importance of their employees. I would like to see them do the job that they want us or their managers to do with the restrictions that they give them."
Safeway,1dbld6dqkbrcm800,5.0,I enjoyed working for Safeway due to the great hard working and respectful for work staff and team. Learned a lot of good skills while working here as a stocker.
Safeway,1dbjdairs24f9000,3.0,This wasnt a good fit for me as someone on the Autism Spectrum.In general because of management people are not happy working there. Many coworkers leave the place. They are overworked/stressed
Safeway,1dbjc02q50mcn004,1.0,"management was rude, would have us out for way too long in ridiculous weather. never fired me, just stopped scheduling me until I called and asked for my final paycheck. DO NOT WORK HERE!!"
Safeway,1dbj49qt624gs000,5.0,This job definitely gives new workers the customer service experience and face paced skills they need. Uniform has to be in tact and customers are #1. The harder you work and push yourself the better you succeed at this job.
Safeway,1dbj47980brcm800,1.0,Honestly from my heart spent 20yr here it was the most stressful job I ever had Albertsons bought them 2017 all they did was cut cut cut labor your one person doing. 5jobs impossible to ever get done with your work.   They want no excuses. Run you into the ground like a dog this is the gods honest truth 2015 my dad passed at 6pm. At 330 that afternoon they wanted me to come in she had to call my boss before she could be human
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dbj454hk24f9000,4.0,The work was very intense and stressful to a degree. Working with other people and customers was the fun part. There were no other real extra curricular activities within the company.
Safeway,1dbhk10nqb88l805,4.0,"When you first start out, you take a lot of computerized tests. Typically management and coworkers don't help you become familiarized with the store so you are in the dark with helping out customers when you are new."
Safeway,1dbgemqdu24f9001,3.0,"I worked in the bakery, so a typical day would start at 4:30 in the morning. I learned that the staff at Safeway are welcoming to newcomers. I had a decent manager, I really don't have much to say on that. The culture was a melting pot, I've learned many customs."
Safeway,1dbf1kvcb1d03000,3.0,Changes things or discontinued offers or start new offers not updating employees training for pharmacy not good no set training department or someone over sees. Training and licensing credentials of new hires
Safeway,1dbesg4is24fj000,4.0,"You can make great money if you are not afraid to work hard, Depending on warehouse and shift you will work a lot of overtime.  Union environment is not the easiest to deal with at times.  Great people with long term employment."
Safeway,1dbeh7qpj5na3800,5.0,"Flexible work schedule, days are very high pace where as nights tend to be much slower giving you the chance to get other tasks completed. Friendly coworkers"
Safeway,1dbe7rpns24eh000,4.0,Manager the over operations of store. The store is fast pace. Had to be able to complete different jobs throughout the store. To be able to work in each department.
Safeway,1dbe7kbjb1d0j000,3.0,"It's a job.  The worst part is probably dealing with customers who have little to no patience and respect for people who work for Safeway.  Management can vary; I had some good managers, I had some bad ones.  But the bad ones can really make work just miserable."
Safeway,1dbe1aq8q1d0j000,2.0,"This experience might be unique to my particular store, but the management is either highly incompetent or willfully destructive in their decision making."
Safeway,1dbdrtp5t1fdk000,3.0,"Hard work for courtesy’s, no one really respects you. You hardly get any hours. Some days are better then others, management is better then some jobs."
Safeway,1dbdnflvt1d03000,5.0,working in livermore store is strssful but any other location fun and help ful no one bother you if you work any other location but livermore sorry have bad experience in my life after 22 years working in pharmacy most of the night i cry after work till i get home
Safeway,1dbdirkht1d03001,4.0,"Everyone that worked there was really nice, and it was easy to make friends.  the manager was good, and treated people right.  it was a little sketchy, being a female courtesy clerk at times.  they did make me get shopping carts by myself at 11pm.  but when i brought it to the attention of a manager, the rules where changed.  i do miss working there at times."
Safeway,1dbbsbf6m1d0j000,2.0,"It's a good place to work, if you don't need money and want good benefits. Since the state is raising minimum wage you will NOT receive a raise, management will not fight for you to get the raises you deserve. It's unorganized you will be overworked and underpaid. On the plus side since they are desperate they will hire anyone and management is very flexible with schedules, but you have to keep an eye on your schedule because they will always mess it up."
Safeway,1dbbrvj0d1d13000,5.0,Always on the go with cutomer orders
Safeway,1dbbpc0kc5na3800,4.0,people had a great sense of humor and were kind. they also had good work ethic and were accountable for themselves making everything run smoothly. customers seemed to like me and the service I gave them.
Safeway,1dbb8u50g1d13000,4.0,Overall it was great place to work. Enjoyed the people i work with A very safe envierment. possible would go back for another job!!need to speak with  company to determan if i can fit in !!!!
Safeway,1dbb1v4av1d13000,5.0,I never had any issues working for safeway and have nothing but good things to say about the company. The day to day included assisting customers and providing excellent customer service.
Safeway,1dbas9i6n1fdk000,4.0,"It's a very busy store , was able to learn how to be fast paste , also you deal with alot of different customers . I like how pay it was weekly pay , you learn alot from this company."
Safeway,1dbaqn67b1d0j000,2.0,I really enjoyed working in the deli as a cashier and the employees were very friendly and helpful and the work atmosphere was great and friendly and management was very polite and great
Safeway,1db9f7sdc24fj000,2.0,"Wouldn't work there again. Never was able to make plans due to schedule changing weekly. A couple gals were rude to me a lot, and no one cared if you're drunk while working like most of them are.. Also minors cleaning bodily fluids which is against code..."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1db950vdi1d13000,3.0,Management would assign me a task but wouldn't train me how to do it properly. This happened multiple times and resulted in me spending an hour figuring out how to do something.
Safeway,1db8qc5gt24g2000,4.0,"Working in the bakery was really fun - as it was just a few girls working back there. I got to help decorate cakes, bake cookies and make bread, and package everything, keep the bakery section looking organized and full."
Safeway,1db8eg6c41d0j000,2.0,complete disregard of the most basic janitorial work while also creating risk for foodborne illnesses with how they store their rotting produce in the same cooler as the fresh product.
Safeway,1db888o8p1d03000,4.0,"it was a good learning curve, for me advanced as far as I could go  its a very stable company. Its very good starting job for kids..meat dept is a physical hard job."
Safeway,1db7jdckl1d0j000,3.0,"I had never worked in a grocery store before, so it was a big learning experience for me. It was a fast paced job where there was always something to do, something to clean, a customer to help, food to prepare. As a deli clerk we prepared foods for the displays; sliced meats and cheeses per customer orders; prepared sandwiches for customers; washed dishes; prepared and cooked whole roasted chickens; and cleaned wherever it was needed, to name a few. The hardest part of the job was the unstable scheduling. Yet, seeing new customers each day and working with my co-workers was the best part."
Safeway,1db6rn0r624e3000,1.0,There may have been benefits but they don’t tell you anything! When I interviewed I was told I would have to join the union and was that acceptable. I asked how much will that cost. I was told “I don’t know exactly but they will be contacting you with all that information when the time comes. The time came and went with no contact from within Safeway and no contact from the union. 2 months later I get a bill in the mail for $458 which was $400 union initiation fee and 1 month $58 union dues. They contacted me because apparently late charges were also applied.
Safeway,1db68umv21d03000,5.0,"Agradable ambiente de trabajo, respeto de horarios, trabajo seguro"
Safeway,1db5qoih91fdk000,3.0,The inconsistent and non trust in store level and mid level management is a major issue in a handful of locations. The fear and bullying are also a concern. The pay and benefits are for positions are comparbal to many other major grocery companies.
Safeway,1db5o2o111d13000,2.0,"I’ve worked for this company over 10 years, they cut hours and increase work loads with minimal raises. About the only time you get hours to do your job is when corporate comes in but then expectations are so crazy that the hours still don’t make up for it, only to cut your hours when they leave to not do your actual job of pleasing customers and having a good operating store.  It’s a corporation that has its priorities not in the right spot and I wouldn’t recommend it if you want to be treated fairly."
Safeway,1db4eujoh24e3000,5.0,At times it get stressful but the hardest part of the job is lifting them heavy chicken boxes and stacking them but I get through the day with a smile
Safeway,1db4adne11d03000,3.0,many things to do if you have a way with people try to understand the workplace and be the best you can be at the work place and understand the things
Safeway,1db46709j1d0j000,1.0,"Horrible company to work for. Nickname from employees; SLAVEWAY. No hours, different jobs than hired for. Horrible management. No training, a sink or swim company."
Safeway,1db3hebf21d03003,2.0,Management doesn't fight for their employees.   I had my manager standby and allow a customer to call me a a racial slur and then tell me that i still had to help the customer.
Safeway,1db3enmkp1d03000,3.0,-A typical day is efficiently checking out customers while maintaining knowledge of prices and savings day to day.
Safeway,1db379mac1d0j000,5.0,this company has been very good for me .I enjoy the challenge of meeting deadlines and advancing sales and growth while managing and training a team .Really enjoy the teamwork atmosphere at safeway.
Safeway,1db28ha321d13000,3.0,"While this might not reflect everyone's experience, I can say working in the deli was not very fulfilling. I started in the night shift, and one issue I ran into early on was a lack of communication between the morning and night crew. The other common issue was turnover, which at one point we were working with half a night crew. At the same time, we were also constantly told ""no overtime."""
Safeway,1db15401a1d13000,3.0,place can be good or bad. depends on your manager. job is easy i would only recommend this to someone going to school just need like little cash to get by .
Safeway,1db0vrecp1d0j000,4.0,A typical day at Safeway as a courtesy clerk for me woodstar around 11 most the time bingo for about 4 or 5 hours. the word for the most part is laid-back you can get a little bit stressed out of times I'm busy days but other than that it's not too hard
Safeway,1db0t89h41d03000,1.0,"It was good until Albertsons took over, it was a great fun work place, it still is a semi nice place to shop at. Customers were good except around the holidays."
Safeway,1davsdbmt1d03000,3.0,There is plenty of different opportunities to advance in the company. Employees are able to be cross trained to get extra hours as well. They would rather promote within the company.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dauthkt4h3pn800,4.0,"Again it was not a place I enjoyed working at, very hard to be there. The management was not great, they could be very very pushy and mean, I would prefer to have nice calm and more relaxed management. Along with that it was not the cleanest place."
Safeway,1daupdinqbre6800,2.0,"Pay and benefits were horrible here. No raise given for being placed in a higher position. Employees came and went because wage, benefits and hours given to work were all low."
Safeway,1daui9ickb868800,3.0,"Safeway used to be a career. But that time has come and gone. If you don't start as a bagger in your teens, you'll never make enough to survive on your own. And even if you do, you still may not."
Safeway,1daue0o1gb8a2800,4.0,"I worked here as a cake decorator and when you do a great job, customers always leave with a smile. You can really get to know someone's personality when they ask you for a specific style of cake. I enjoyed getting to see everyone smile and buy the display cakes."
Safeway,1daubj61fb82c800,4.0,Can be alot of work. So.etimes it's a team effort most times individual. I've worked at 3 stores and only 2 I would recommend. Managment and staff play a big part on weither the store is a fun and safe place to work.
Safeway,1dat32g0mbre6800,1.0,"Night crew is overworked, understaffed. Cannot keep employees. You start at $10.80 to work hard, fast and meet all other duty requirements. I was kept after my shift without agreement. Work morale is very poor. Each person I worked with felt they were not appreciated and took no pride in their work or employer. Most were great people in general and their current disposition was not their fault. One woman who was training me began slandering me and other night crew members in Spanish to another employee, right next to me. She was assuming I didn't know Spanish. This concluded my second and last night of my Safeway employment experience."
Safeway,1das2hf0ob8a2800,5.0,This was my very first official corporate job. I was paid min wage. I was a courtesy clerk and worked in the dairy. I also worked in produce from time to time. learned how to interact and deal with variety of people.
Safeway,1dars57k9h3hr800,4.0,"Enjoy working at Safeway, however getting any type of raise can be difficult.  Its a pretty laid back environment, can be stressful at times. Hardest part is getting time with upper management to discuss issues."
Safeway,1dapn3vc9bre0800,4.0,"Working at Safeway as a curtesy clerk, your typical day was bagging groceries, Helping people out to their cars if they needed help, sweeping the stores, cleaning bathrooms, and bringing in carts. The thing that I loved the most working there was my coworkers, They are super fun to work with! I think that the hardest part of the job was having todo carts in the really hot sun wearing black clothing, or having todo carts when it was dumping down rain."
Safeway,1dapjgtqfb825800,4.0,Safeway created a lot of opportunity for me by allowing me to train in multiple departments and really helped me be able to work under a lot of pressure. i think people are under appreciated and are not paid what deserved.
Safeway,1dapeomobh3lh800,4.0,My days at work was good sometimes I didn't learn much there was helping people with their  groceries working out side in snow and cold and cleaning up
Safeway,1dapbkk3ab862800,2.0,"Safeway was not enjoyable for me, I worked hard for long hours and the pay was way under than it should be in my opinion. Probably the most stressful activity I have done was work there."
Safeway,1dap980clbre0801,2.0,Overall working there is kind of stressful depending on what you're doing but I wouldn't dissuade someone from applying here. It's a good start for working up in a department store
Safeway,1dap7pgnrh3lh800,4.0,"I enjoyed my time at Safeway. Great pay and great people, but the internal management of individual stores are weak. When given the opportunity, you will get used by management."
Safeway,1daouj00th3lh800,1.0,making cakes for customers and also making sure they were happy. the hardest part about the job was management and feeling unappreciated.typical day at work was very stressful.
Safeway,1daoq43cs5j54800,4.0,"A little tiring, customers can be hard to handle, some of the managers were hard to work with but it was a fun environment. It was pretty easy to remember the produce codes and there was a lot of help from the managers and other experienced cashiers."
Safeway,1danei6tub825800,1.0,"The bare minimum entry level job as a customer service drone. No one wanted to be there, no one was paid enough, no one expected to be there next year."
Safeway,1dan42i76b862800,1.0,"Loved wprking alongside leople of similar mindset, casual work environent with busy fast paced atmosphere. Great balance ofr freindliness amd professionalism."
Safeway,1damvf0koh3tj800,4.0,Overall a very good company to work for good benefits
Safeway,1dams0uo8b825800,5.0,bagging grocery and putting carts back and helping customer's find stuff in the food isles
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1dakrav3m5ndm800,3.0,"At first I was in Human Resources, I was promoted to Field Specialist"
Safeway,1dais2p5gb862800,1.0,I feel like safeway could have been a good fit for me only because I was doing the type of work I want to do but the fact that they take money out of your paycheck just to be an employee due the fact that they are uinion and a certain dollar amount had to be paid for each month employed there and they took it straight from our pay..if you were lucky enough to work hours that were worth working and making it through to the next paycheck.
Safeway,1dahui6ln5ndm800,4.0,"This was the first time that I worked in a food, convenient store environment. With my nervousness I felt supported from day one. The training was spot on and the atmosphere was fast and exciting. The staff and management were like a team. Loved it!"
Safeway,1dahhu44oh3pi800,3.0,The hours vary and get called off for shifts. The managers ask you to use vacation so make up hours after they call u off for ur schedule shifts. The pay could be a lot better.
Safeway,1dahh49jtb825800,5.0,What's good was the hours and my coworkers are the best management was very nice work with work easy not hard the job was one of the jobs I love to do again
Safeway,1dafv0nhrb825805,3.0,Other than the pay you are working whenever they need you. I only feel rested when I am on vacation. Just because there’s never any consistency in shifts.
Safeway,1daf9snc8h45d800,1.0,"One of the worst jobs I've ever had. Management doesn't care about anything besides their own greed. There's no organization, and you will scrounge for hours to work. The older employers have found ways to be lazy and make the newbies do all of the work. Pay is terrible, and there's very little advancement in the company. Don't even bother."
Safeway,1dadg8280b85g800,4.0,I've worked at other chain stores and none have been like Safeway. My coworkers are really cool and the management actually seems to be super involved with everything that is going on around the store. The guests that come in usually are regulars and it's cool to build a sort of rapport with them.
Safeway,1daa6oivnb85g800,1.0,"Very stressful! They want you to do a 2-3 persons job .Want 8 hours worth of work in 5. Pay is awful, don’t make enough for the cost of living in the area.  Short staffed"
Safeway,1da7e6vhkb85g800,2.0,"Production standards too high, management doesn't really know what they're doing. Everyone hates working there but the money's good enough so they stay. I was lied to in my interview, I have 5 years of forklift expierance and I was told it would take 2 years to get to a lift position when in reality it takes 10+ years, I wouldn't have accepted the job if I knew it took that long."
Safeway,1da660m10b85g800,4.0,"Managers ranged from decent to terrible. The job was tedious, boring and forgettable. The coworkers were great, but it didn't make up for the immense cons of the job."
Safeway,1da5rthurb89b800,3.0,This is a food starting job however if you are just starting they will most likely only work you 8 hour shifts on the weekends. They have to give you 16 hours per week minimum so it will usually be both Saturday and Sunday
Safeway,1da3v3966b81j800,1.0,"The best things about the company are the benefits, weekly pay, and a few of the coworkers. Union dues used to be taken out in one sum at the beginning of each month. Fortunately, that changed and it is now a small amount each paycheck."
Safeway,1da2554jgb81j800,1.0,Management at Safeway is poorly they treat their employees very badly not a good good place to work. Work hours are terrible they will bounce you back and forth til 11pm then got to be back in at 7am .
Safeway,1da1jjf9db89b800,3.0,"Overall everything was generally okay, my biggest problem was mostly customers bringing their problems into the store bringing any good mood down instantly. Other than that, as soon as the words ""I want to see the manager"" came out of their mouth, it was always a ""you should fire this person because they won't let me be mean to them"" type of tone. On the other hand, you also need to watch out for shoplifters and scammers who were always on the foot at my store."
Safeway,1d9rp5tdgb81j800,1.0,"My experience with Safeway had some good qualities, and if you work hard it's relatively easy to advance. However, stores are frequently understaffed, management had little to no organization and employees are treated poorly. At Safeway I experienced poor time management, unsafe work conditions, and even illegal activity (one example would be management making people work off the clock). While not every Safeway store may operate this way, and each store is a *somewhat* different experience, there are far too many that do function this way and sometimes create hostile/unsafe work environments."
Safeway,1d9rdv3mpb81j800,3.0,"Working as a bookkeeper was pretty cool, chill and laid back. I was able to work on my time as long as I am complete at a certain time. Until this new manager came in and tries running things in an unprofessional manner. She was very rude to the employees and seemed to pick on them as well, including myself. Not sure what her mission was, but I'm assuming to cause negative vibes throughout the store. Once I learned that she was being rotated out which I never quite understood, things did get better however it it totally turned me off from working there."
Safeway,1d9ld42r3h3t4800,4.0,"The job has okay hours/weekly pay but,its not organized on how they run their company as far as hours or overtime hours.it is a great job fulll-time/part-time if you just need money in your pocket and not picky on your amount of pay for the need of your living situttion."
Safeway,1d9h7pa49b85g800,3.0,It was an alright place to work. A lot of people complained about not getting the training they needed. I felt that some of that was true. A lot of it was more of a learn as you go kind of thing.
Safeway,1d9h01qm6brdf800,3.0,"Typical day would be providing customer service and making sure top selling items are always available for customers. You learn excellent customer service skills, team work, and problem solving. Management is fair and works well with schedules. Clientele is very diverse. Hardest part of the job would be time management and the most enjoyable part would be checking out the customers, and interacting with them as well."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d9adec4vh3h8800,2.0,I have only worked in Safeway/Albertsons with unions so I cannot speak of the non union stores.
Safeway,1d99f374vh3sk800,5.0,The employees are a lot of fun and treat you like family when you’re on their good side. The customers are another thing when they don’t understand when we’re understaffed.
Safeway,1d990t86fh3ok800,5.0,Enjoyed work but wanted more weekends off. Cutting and arranging fresh fruit trays and bowls also making guacamole bowls.  Part time hours were also good
Safeway,1d98ro02f0kbn000,3.0,Everyday was different because of the people that would walk in ( Customers ). Learning to work with your employees and aslo having patience for your customers.
Safeway,1d98hr0apb81e800,3.0,I did not like the low pay I received while working here as a Deli clerk.
Safeway,1d98h86f6h3ok800,1.0,I really have a good experience from Safeway and i really want to go back to my jop cause of the pay and especially the cow workers. I can pay for my bills and still have money for my kids.
Safeway,1d98gvteebrda800,3.0,Want to leave due to management. Manager does not know how to mange people or properly handle workloads.  Some people have small workloads because they can't handle more work and she is fine with them not being able to work like everyone else so those that can get overloaded.  If you take on more she'll just keep on giving you more.
Safeway,1d9895ekeh3ok800,3.0,"Enjoyed working as cashier, interacting with the customers. Getting to know how customers shopped based upon their culture, and their willingness to share information on different items they bought. Learning the fruit/vegetable codes can be a bit much, but once you've got it - a piece of cake!"
Safeway,1d96soqguh3kk800,3.0,I remember working for vons part time and and only for a short amount. It was a good beginning step towards later grocery store and retail chains. Not much else to say
Safeway,1d96qukoo0kbn000,3.0,"nice air conditioned place  where you are expected to       work constantly...no place to  sit except 'on break',,,nobody sits,  not even the GM....coworkers are nice, but love to    gossip"
Safeway,1d96n2io7brda800,4.0,Safeway taught me how to go out and reach towards people by
Safeway,1d96jgkhb0mcl000,5.0,"I learned alot of things since i have been working here, I plan on continuing my work here. All the managers i encounter with are very understanding and helps out alot as well."
Safeway,1d96crh2nb85a800,2.0,I worked there for about 2 weeks in the deli department. Which they were hurting in BAD. I was fully qualified aswell which made it even better. The Manager there accused me of doing things I did not do. I was also not told that there was a probationary period from the time you got hired so you were not allowed to go home or request time off. At one point I had to leave work to go to the hospital because it was an emergency. A couple days later I get called and they fire me because going to the hospital is no excuse... And because I wasn't in my department all the time....anyway just dont work there. Trash management and increasingly insensitive to your own personal life.
Safeway,1d967h8glh3kk800,1.0,If anyone ever worked for Safeway in the deli then they should know coming in as a new employee for the deli department they always make you close. They are always short on staff so more then likely your doing your work plus someone else work. Your don't get properly trained. After maybe your second day they make you close by yourself. I don't see anybody being happy working there.
Safeway,1d95qn4ofb896800,4.0,Safeway is a good company that was bought out by another company.  With recent management changes safeway has became a better company to work for.  Their MGMT program and training is done really well.
Safeway,1d95qh488b896800,5.0,My time at Safeway was amazing. I was with the company for 3 years and would recomend it to anyone seeking a career that provides advancment opportunity.
Safeway,1d942f1fpb85a800,1.0,"10 years of busting my a s s, doing what the men did and NEVER was promoted. The don’t care about their employees."
Safeway,1d93pffblb81e800,4.0,They offer flexible scheduling. Employees were nice. Management was not so great. I asked for more hours multiple times and I never got it. Sometimes customers were rude.
Safeway,1d938quolb81e800,4.0,People were cool there wanted to stay but wasn't getting enough hours less then 40hours a week hard work but great benefits Teamsters.
Safeway,1d938d1hqb85a800,5.0,"I learned alot in my year at Safeway. Starting at courtesy clerk and working my way up to Nightstock/Cashier at the age of 19 was a great achievement in my life. I learned to challenge myself to do better everyday and keep working hard, because it will always pay off."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d8fhqi7ib84q800,4.0,Nice working there because of building relationships or fellow employees and customers! Was able to have my own space to knee organized. And was able to work with friends
Safeway,1d8enhfl0b80m800,3.0,Must know item code to efficiently ring customers at the check out counter.
Safeway,1d8ehvpq924fp000,3.0,I liked working here but the pharmacist allowed a couple older techs to be really rude and ignorant to a few of us younger ladies. They were really crabby with our customers as well. Cooperate never listens to regular employees only management.
Safeway,1d8d8esfqbrco800,3.0,great people to work with. always made it a safe environment and kept the deli clean. customers would come in hangry and leave satisfied. pay was not so good.
Safeway,1d8d6f7hdb84q800,3.0,It was a fast paced place to work that always seemed under staffed so there was a lot of things to do before you got off work. If you did finish all your work before your shift was done then you got some downtime.
Safeway,1d8cmm7m91ah2000,5.0,Very much enjoyed the opportunities Safeway gave to employees who wanted to have the opportunity to work their way up within the organization.  Very supportive.
Safeway,1d8chc8rb24f9000,2.0,I was a Deli Clerk for almost a year and the way they handle problems with employees is awful. Managers brush you off like your a nuisance and my experience in two different Safeway’s was the same. People are dishonest negative and spiteful if you are a hard worker in the deli. It’s extremely backwards but you’ll become a target if you one up people by being a hard worker.
Safeway,1d8asqcbtb80m800,1.0,Horrible place poor management low payment they talk to you any kind of way that they sees fit and poor hygiene at the deli Area an never have anything in stock
Safeway,1d8aftrc9brco800,2.0,Safeway was a better company before Albertsons got their hooks into it. The smaller chains take better care of their employees. You will have increased responsibility but will take an act of God to get compensated correctly. Management will pit crew against each other to meet unrealistic sales goals.
Safeway,1d89jg2qsb88l800,3.0,"Work is stressful,  Sunday work is optional unless management needs you, low pay  rate plus sometimes management can be rude  including most workers. No privacy"
Safeway,1d87cib84b88l800,3.0,"Working at Safeway was my first job and its not a terrible first job. If you love fast paste work Safeway is for you. the only problem with being a courtesy clerk there was that I couldn't find the cleaning and supplies to replace paper towels, tissue and hand soap. That was really the main problem."
Safeway,1d86r4q5cak8h800,3.0,I worked at Safeway to be with people. That e was the only reason as I was retired at the time. Giving back to our little community was rewarding. I certainly didn't work for the money.
Safeway,1d86psvc30mta000,1.0,"my typical day at work was to work up to seven different departments, and be given grief if I couldn't finish a job in the hours I was allotted for the department I was working in. The store managers never listened to any complaints any employee had unless it from a department head. My department head would constantly come to work late, leave work early, and disappear from his department for hours at a time, usually to hang out in different departments to chat. Some of the people in my department would just do the bare minimum of work, leaving rotten food sitting on the shelves, and would only clean the department once every couple of months."
Safeway,1d86oreul24gp000,5.0,"management leaves something to be desired, the hours suck, the pay is not enough to live on, a typical day at work during the week is slow and pretty boring"
Safeway,1d86bko9bb84q800,2.0,"Hours are available, however, favoritism and hierarchy come into play when schedules are made. If  you are willing to bend over backwards to make yourself indispensable and please upper management in addition to your job, you will do OK, otherwise the day to day is miserable."
Safeway,1d85e2ajlb84q800,1.0,"Horrible, I hated working there... there is no words to describe it. Management is horrible. Job duties are horrible. It’s not worth the try to get hired there."
Safeway,1d84ulfhgb88l800,1.0,"It's okay,manager was hard to get along with at times. Wish I had better pay. The people I worked with were great and I loved working with the customers, I got to know a lot of them because I worked in such a small town. So it was noce yo see them and it helped cheer me up when my nights eere were dragging on forever!!!"
Safeway,1d84s02ovb84q801,3.0,Fast paced and normally stay busy all day. Able to help co-workers if they need help. Management works well with employees if they have a family emergency or medical appointments.
Safeway,1d84f574lbrco800,4.0,"So far I don't have any problem working at Safeway, it just that I looking for something will help in future and willy to pay good amount of salary that can provide me to pay expense."
Safeway,1d8401us6b80m800,5.0,Working there was a great first job. It was a terrific learning opportunity and I was given the chance to practice social skills and acquire customer service skills in the process.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d835hbbhbrco800,3.0,"Management for my department of when I got relocated to work under the floral department, my boss for that department was very good and provided enough help where needed. I had learned many and very fascinating tasks while in that department."
Safeway,1d82rai7i1bgc000,3.0,"In light of the recent expansion of pharmacist duties, patient care has suffered.  I love my patients but it has been difficult to provide them the attention they deserve with a increasing workload that is not partnered with additional ancillary staff."
Safeway,1d82jvoq524el000,4.0,"It is a good starting job for any teenagers looking for part time money. For my years of working there, it took almost 6 months for me to be moved to a different department after constantly asking management."
Safeway,1d822vo62brcj800,3.0,A typical day for me is very much the same everyday. I have a list of things I need to get done each day and I do them. I have learned to move fast and get as much as I can get done in the amount of time I am given. Management is fine as long as I do my job. I like and get along with the people I work with. My job is not hard at all I just have to move at a fast pace. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with. I enjoy putting a smile on there face and they do the same for me.
Safeway,1d81r09jp1d1f000,2.0,"There is near zero communication between upper management and lower management, which results in the store manager constantly getting angry at the wrong people for the wrong things."
Safeway,1d81pdri5brcj800,3.0,the store I work at was not the best representation of what the company was due to poor management and lack of management coordination. the job is mostly cleaning and working with the customers.
Safeway,1d81iga0b1d1f000,4.0,"Operated cash register, prepare food orders, courteous customer service and maintained deli cleanliness. Responsible for assisting customers with information and purchases"
Safeway,1d81ebfhib84k800,2.0,"High stress with low reward. Doe's not work well without a flexible life. A very thankless and unfulfilling job, so much to a degree of affecting mental health. Meeting people can be fun."
Safeway,1d81chdep24g5000,2.0,"Safeway was my first actual job, I loved it. I like how they are very helpful and they would like to help you grow within the company. I enjoyed my time there."

Safeway,1d7vic3drbrcj800,5.0,"working at safeway was extremely fun, fast paced, and running around were the keys to success, keep an eye on your duties, and always help customers and fellow employees and your time there will be amazing"
Safeway,1d7vfc6di1ags000,3.0,"Safeway provided a good opportunity for advancement.  However, it is a very stressful climb that requires a lot of overtime hours that you are not paid for."
Safeway,1d7vava97b80i800,4.0,Had a great experience loved to work for this company.
Safeway,1d7v87ln2b84k800,5.0,the job was fast paced and very exciting. the customers are kind to a point of service for a market. the hours are long but worth the job details. great starter job
Safeway,1d7v7i7ie52ta800,4.0,"If you new to any city, then Safeway is a good enough place as any to start. Most of the people are friendly and it's a good environment overall. I do have to say that it can be stressful at times and people are often rude to you if there is a language barrier."
Safeway,1d7t7706l1ah9000,3.0,"The work days are busy, with the schedule having either too many cashiers working at once or too little, never an in between. I didn't learn much from working there but only because I already knew how to use a cash register, face aisles, and bag items. The job was difficult when it got busy. Management dislikes getting on registers, a few employees call out and don't show up without consequence more often than not."
Safeway,1d7sbitlm1d0v000,1.0,Days were long did lots of other things beside my job like the liquer department or bread department helped people with money orders or lotto change to the cashiers
Safeway,1d7odkl7i1d1c000,2.0,"I worked there for a long time and always wanted more hours and begged and asked and begged for more hours, but never got them because they kept hiring people"
Safeway,1d7npm4gc1d0d000,3.0,A regular day at work is facing up the department first thing you walk in setting up the service case filling up/refreshing what belongs in there.
Safeway,1d7lq0c2i1fdv000,4.0,good co workers. My job allowed me family time. Can't say that about all positions but there a few good jobs to have. Have been working for 28 years time for a change before retiring.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d7lil6a61d0d000,3.0,Overall once albertson took over everything went down hill.new management and merging co workers the worst idea ever. I suggest go to work for ralphs.
Safeway,1d7l9g6ji1d0v000,3.0,"Its a good first job to work for, but really nothing more. everything there is meh, the company obviously doesn't really care about their employees very much."
Safeway,1d7l2hu4o1fdv000,1.0,They call it slaveway for a reason. They will work you over 12 plus hours a day to get the most out of tou and still expect more you will never do enough or be good enough for there unreasonable demands.
Safeway,1d7l17ltj1d0v000,3.0,"Well they say there is benefits, it is only after three months and a SOLID 40 hours or more a week (which is rare). No pay raise for courtesy clerk position. Not very good management. On the other hand, it is a great friendly environment with flexible hours/"
Safeway,1d7kp55r31d1c000,5.0,"fast paced work enviroment very stressful, must like to work with public to work here, i enjoyed the customers and meeting thier needs, only bad part is no two days off in a row and no weekends off"
Safeway,1d7it9r6s52t2800,4.0,"I worked at this store twice. Once years ago before their remodel and now again for some extra money. I never expect much from a grocery store, but this is ridiculous. Other workers aren't interested in helping new ones, and are borderline almost hostile when asked. There was no training and lots of laughing and looking down at you if you screwed up. And forget about confidentiality here, one person knows something and EVERYONE knows. No accountability for anyone. Managers all seem to be new (or something). No one even wants to be bothered with customers! Customer service should ALWAYS be number one. I've seen night stockers on the ground stocking not move and get mad at customers for bugging them, front end managers be downright rude to customers for being expected to do their jobs....I wouldnt recommend this store in MD to anyone. Dont do it, I'm regretting it."
Safeway,1d7ij6qr11d0l000,5.0,Highly demanding of management . Not much in salary increase. Work life balance is almost non existent. Training new employees has become non existent
Safeway,1d7i7ua5f24gb000,1.0,Bad place. NO benefits. no clear direction. unsafe place. horrible management. the management does not follow through or give guidance on anything or to anyone.
Safeway,1d7i3bhbh1ahj000,4.0,I was a cashier and this job was fast paced.  Depending on the time of the day customers would be constantly be coming in.  We had to know sku numbers for produce.  If we did not recognize this information our productivity was slow.
Safeway,1d7hri30n24es000,3.0,Working in safeway somehow help me in highschool. It was really stressful working during fridays. They made sure underage people don't work for more than 40 hrs a week.
Safeway,1d7gsc0lh24es000,4.0,"If you have strong ""Work Ethics"" and a Conscience, Easy Peezy!"
Safeway,1d7glm8gt1fdk000,4.0,check emails make sure gas prices didn't change then check the notebook management would write in then check in to the register help customers. IF it wasn't to busy we would clean outside go up to the store restock. then take out trash at the end of your shift. while doing all the duties you are assigned throughout the day.
Safeway,1d7g5h2iu1d12000,3.0,Safeway was very fast paced with lots to do every day. The staff are very nice and enjoy working by your side. Work load can be difficult due to the cut of budget
Safeway,1d7fp6jcf1d02000,3.0,They treated you like a teenager and a kid while also expecting you to know everything already. They barely trained me and put me on the job and the most of the workers were grumpy and were not very accommodating. Some management would be okay but most of the time the place was a wreck and not a good working environment. If you are a teenager or getting your first job it is okay but other than that I do not recommend this job.
Safeway,1d7fjkb2b1d12000,3.0,"Working in the deli is not an easy job, it never will be. However it is a good job if you want to be on a team with direction. There's always something to keep your hands busy even if the pacing gets slow and fast depending on the time of day."
Safeway,1d7fiqgeq1d12000,4.0,always like the grocery business I like dealing with customers I like building projects building display stocking produce cashier stocking getting rid of product cross merchandising
Safeway,1d7fgq9oa5n9a800,1.0,"I worked two stints at this particular store: from 1996-1999, and again from 2008-2010.  My experiences of the two employment periods were starkly different from each other.  From 1996-1999, the store managers, assistant managers, and department managers collaborated effectively to ensure that their customers were satisfied.  During the latter employment experience with this company, the store manager seemed very disinterested in maintaining a satisfactory experience for her patrons.  Training for new employees was limited to minimal computer-based applications and a bit of guidance from front-end or department managers, who rarely appeared to be on the same page."
Safeway,1d7fd1jjq1d0l000,2.0,"You may get hired for one position but will be asked to perform many other position duties. Like for example I was hired as a Decorator but was constantly asked to do Bakers duties. I am a team player and didn't mind at first. But when I found out Bakers make a lot more and I should have been getting paid Bakers wages. No one told me that and wasn't gonna tell me. I have been with Safeway for a little over a year and have been transferred to 3 different locations. I stayed at the first location for 4mons, second location 10mons, and just started the third location. When you are transferred to a location you are never told until the day before or when the new schedule comes out which is weekly. The pay rate is minimum wage. You have to become a part of the Bakers Union. With the union contract you can never be full time unless you are a manager. Your pay rate only goes up 10cents for every so many hrs you work. I wouldn't recommend working here. If you have a car and don't mind being moving around at will then this is the job for you."
Safeway,1d7fav16624es000,5.0,Flexible schedule and great paycheck.... it’s good environment for your first job opportunity.... experience worthy and you get to get discounts on deli lunch specials....
Safeway,1d7fafbv51ahj000,3.0,The company was big on providing great customer service.  And would have daily meetings to provide feedback as far as how you succeeding.  Great feeling knowing how you were doing on a daily basis.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d7dq12rf1fdk000,3.0,The employees at Safeway are all nice and generous people it makes for a quite enjoyable work environment. The managers at Safeway are always very helpful
Safeway,1d7didfhb1agi000,3.0,"I enjoyed working with fun, hard working people. we worked as a team to accomplish our goals. I also worked alone with limited supervision when needed. I became known as a very dependable worker. I was very accurate and fast at my job and had great customer service skills."
Safeway,1d7dhb26t1d12000,5.0,cashiering and customers services would have prepared me for the retail world and customer service and grocery world.. with the help of skills that I have learned have helped as well
Safeway,1d7d6fhg31d12000,1.0,Training is a joke.
Safeway,1d7d2o58r5n9a800,4.0,Safeway is a great place to work in retail. Provides great opportunity to work within different areas. Great setting for learning customer service skills.
Safeway,1d7bqjlnr1d0p000,1.0,I did learn people skills but the management was absolutely horrible because they did not respect my school schedule even when I told my supervisors the specific times and days I could or could not be at work they still went over my head and gave me shifts that interfered with my school schedule and I would have to ask people over and over and to cover my shifts because I had important things to do for school.
Safeway,1d7b9aruf24e9000,5.0,I give it a five because it was good for a summer job.
Safeway,1d7b8ll691fdq000,2.0,When I first started it was a great place to work . Then politics took over and made for a poor work place. The pay was great and the hours were good.
Safeway,1d7b22tgr52t1800,5.0,Relaxed and nice place to work. Nice managers and very clean and organized. Sometimes the work was too easy but otherwise was fine. Small crew which I liked and beautiful area that the store was located at. Set schedule which I really loved and always accommodated any days off I needed.
Safeway,1d7anua0e1fdq000,4.0,Working with Safeway was fun when we had a good store manager.  I started off as a Deli clerk then got promoted to work in the customer service department and pay raise 3 months of working. After the 3 months working in the customer service department I got another pay raise for doing a good job and putting effort in working. I also got offered to become a grocery manager but declined because I really wasn't ready for the responsibility. Everything was fun while it lasted.
Safeway,1d7akv2cf1d0a000,4.0,"I learned new things daily at Safeway, management was fair, coworkers we're nice and also enjoyed their jobs. The hardest part would be having to stand for 8 hours a day."
Safeway,1d7ab08q61d0p000,1.0,"Poor management, management will scream at you in front of customers. Very poor customer service. Nobody has any accountability or sense of loyalty. employees shop at competitive stores instead of their own."
Safeway,1d780iqr91d0p000,5.0,"Learned a lot about retail business, management and a lot of growing opportunities within the company it’s a fast paced all year round work experience"
Safeway,1d77vbfcj1d0a000,1.0,"Download products in aisle to be stocked on shelves. Cleanup by collecting cardboard and plastic. Insert cardboard in Baler to create bale. Faced products near end of shift. Manager lack people skills, she talks down and threaten employees. Hardest part of the job is down stocking multiple pallets. Workplace culture high-tension. Enjoyable part of the job, looking forward to going home."
Safeway,1d76i4h541d18000,2.0,"Personally, I was not incredibly fond of my time at Safeway. The specific Safeway I worked at was incredibly stressful. There were many general managers, and they did not communicate well with each other or with staff. As a Courtesy Clerk, I was the lowest rung on the totem pole and made to do jobs that I was not supposed to."
Safeway,1d75hjk4l1bg6000,3.0,"It is fast paced in the deli. Many opportunities to advance. Same songs playing all day. Good people there. They give good feedback and encouragement. In Duvall, WA."
Safeway,1d75a2dnp1d0a000,4.0,"Good company, bad at backing up employees against customer complaints. Not very strong union. Employee moral is not the best. Overall not a bad company to work for. Jude’s have to know what your signing  up for."
Safeway,1d74u7dhr1ai4000,3.0,Safeway had an uneasy way of communication with all teams because of past experiences. Therefore when I came in they had rules that didn't seem reasonable at all. Learning and helping in other departments wasn't something they encouraged which came as a shock to me.
Safeway,1d7483bjs1fdq000,1.0,Mismanagement of employees and lack of attention to detail attributed on a high turnover rate and made it almost impossible to maintain any kind of standard.
Safeway,1d73l437t1d0p000,4.0,"Enjoyed my co-workers and customers. It is a fast-paced and interesting industry. Employees are friendly, hours can vary weekly. It's beneficial to love the food and grocery business if you work in that area."

Safeway,1d730dqh51d18000,4.0,I do not get enough hours as a checker and remain part time.
Safeway,1d72onkn01d18000,4.0,"it was busy as usual in retail setting, the first day in a new work place if someone can show you around the pharmacy set up that will much easier to adapt. The direction from the manager is very important that need to be clear and is not change too frequently, that will create the confusion to the staff, that is hardest part of the job. The teamwork and willingness to help each other that will make your day go easy and enjoy to work"
Safeway,1d72ibgl11d18000,4.0,I have have a positive work experience at Safeway. The customers are nice and the management is fair to every employee. There are plenty of opportunities to move to different departments. The hours that I work are pretty much up to me.
Safeway,1d72hc41i1d0p000,5.0,"It's union, you get union benefits, and union breaks, working on a union is actually beneficial to most people. Most of the managers were willing to work with you."
Safeway,1d71cp7581d05000,5.0,Spent 15 years with Safeway and I enjoyed my time with them I moved on only because I was seeking specific needs which were unavailable in a retail grocery environment. Culture is great and my fellow colleagues and customers were the strong point of my career with them. Highly recommend them for someone looking to build a career.
Safeway,1d7187ct91d0l000,4.0,"Learned a lot about customer service and working with different people but over all the jobs were really easy. The management was not that great but nonetheless I liked my managers at the time. Overall it was a great experiencing, I made a ton of friends and I had fun."

Safeway,1d70stoe31fdl000,3.0,"I worked at Safeway for a while and I found the job to be very fast paced and very stressful. You were always moving around and having to help customers, you had a lot of job responsibilities and it always felt like you had very little time to get them done."
Safeway,1d70so5fa1d05000,2.0,"The management team I was under (ASD) gave us extra duties/expectations that were achievable if you could spend 3/4 of you shift executing them. I was never lucky enough to be able to spend that much of my shift doing the ""extras"" mainly because I had a store to run, employees to supervise, lunches/breaks to cover, back-up check, customers to answer to. I was under the impression that the biggest part of my job was to ensure that the front end was operating at the maximum speed of efficiency as possible and the grocery side could wait if needed. The big boss never had problems with my closings, the ASD had an issue with all of my closings. Never getting any positive feedback  from the ASD I stopped caring because no matter what it wasn't ever going to be ""good enough"""
Safeway,1d70q2gb51d0l000,4.0,safeway was a fun place to work all in all it wasn't to bad was my second job starting out after high school so it was a fun learning experience  moved on to a different job because it wasn't paying enough

Safeway,1d6v0uhpm1d05000,3.0,"I got this job during high school because I needed a job. Thankfully, despite the customer culture and the awful nature of working in customer service, there were so many different jobs that I was able to rotate between them frequently."
Safeway,1d6ulqkgi24e6000,1.0,wasn't a good job only had 20 hrs or less . managers never wanted to work with you .and to guarantee hours you would of had to had a letter written with how many hours promised . 20 hours or less wasn't enough even working 2 departments.

Safeway,1d6tqqvg91fdl000,3.0,"Normally I would just move products onto the floor. Such as, cases of of water, soda, chips. Honestly, I didn't learn much at all at this job, except for realizing that I don't want to work at Safeway for a long period of time. The job was really easy, it just got boring fast. The best part of the job was definitely my coworkers. They were really nice people to work with."
Safeway,1d6tn8c0d1d14000,1.0,"Harassment from grocery manager to other employees, poor management from five different managers, and cutting employee hours but not their own. After 20 years in this company I have seen many managers display the same toxic behavior that no one wants to be around."
Safeway,1d6t8d4aj52su800,3.0,"I mean it’s not a bad place to work at it’s just some Safeway will try u. It depends on what u sign up for but as a delie clerk u half to cook, cut, fixed food, clean an take orders."
Safeway,1d6t5eiel5j4r800,3.0,"As my first job it was fine as it was, in the beginning hours were fine and flexible but as more time passed on and less staff was available I would go from having 25 hours to 40 for what was a part time job."
Safeway,1d6t1vbp31d0l000,1.0,Unprofessional ??  to much drama about each other.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d6sbap951d14000,3.0,Morning started by getting product out for sale. Made sure to pull all expired items off tables and cases. Log in daily temperature of all cases and freezers. Most of days were a great day at safeway.  Enjoyed customers who shopped on daily basis.
Safeway,1d6rv4fv524em000,5.0,"A typical day at Safeway was stressful, no lie; I worked outside in the dead heat for hours at a time gathering carts, as I was scheduled to do so. I bagged groceries for customers, dealt with customers, anything they needed a range from opening the liquor cabinet to walking groceries out to their car; Even cleaned restrooms and preformed a full floor sweep of the entire store. I learned diligence from Safeway, I rode my bike to work made sure to keep on time, any time of day I was scheduled I made sure to be there. Hardest part would be keeping up with the fast flow at times, I could be called over the intercom to clean up but there'd be a customer in need of assistance right in front of me, nothing I couldn't handle. Enjoyed my coworkers, always relied on them for help when I didn't know what to do next. there were times when I didn't have a thing to do, reaching out to them helped get my pace going."
Safeway,1d6rol9pp24f6000,2.0,If you make any suggestions on improving just keep them to yourself.... Kiss your raises goodbye unless your upper management . and if you do get a raise it will be pretty insignificant....
Safeway,1d6rmq5hf1fdl000,3.0,"Although the supervisors try to keep up morale (pot lucks, birthday cake once a month, relaxed dress code on Fridays/weekends), I found it a stressful place to work. Call center workers are not really able to fix most problems for their customers, and in many cases are not even able to give them pertinent information. Having the responsibility of listening to customer issues and having no tools or authority to make it right is frustrating."
Safeway,1d6rfcn7q1fdl000,5.0,Paycheck is consistent if you work. Work enviromenr is good aslong as you do your job. Staying focused and work with a positive attitude helps day go by quickly.  Great clients with a friendly smile. That is what I maintained.
Safeway,1d6rb76i11d14000,5.0,My experience at Safeway was short but I had a good time and met new people and enjoyed my short time working there. People where friendly & easy to work with.
Safeway,1d6r987em1d14000,3.0,"Safeway was a quick paced store, usually resulting in my staying at my register. I kept my station orderly & clean in order to give my customers the experience they want/need. Occasionally I would restock candy, but was at the register for most of my shifts."
Safeway,1d6r6ej8b1d0l000,3.0,"the company does not provide you with sufficient help to extend both quality work and great customer service. Employees are not fully trained in one department before they are sent (untrained) to another department, even when the employee is unwilling to go. There is no reward for hard working, loyal employees, or discipline for the ones just barely getting by. In either case, they both just get  a check."
Safeway,1d6r480sh1d05000,3.0,"Good job for someone just starting in the retail field. With more and more self checkout  there are fewer hours for cashiers, so a person might want to work in another department in the store."
Safeway,1d6qspa3352su800,5.0,start day by walking the store finding out the needs of the store and then act the make sure the problem was solved. Worked with employees on making sure the work environment was a fun and safe place to work.
Safeway,1d6qou0po1agj000,4.0,The work was productive and steady. The people that worked there were wonderful and always nice. Everyone was helpful and treated with respect. It was also nice to have regular customers that come in.
Safeway,1d6p8i9lf1d13000,1.0,This place sucks.manger takes workers hours to work for herself. You can never count on your hours.They hire people who are almost illiterate. They give you one apron.one hat..The place is so dirty I can't figure out how they aren't closed down by health department.
Safeway,1d6ovi1ja1fdk000,1.0,"The worst company I have ever worked for since Albertsons took over, too bad they do not know how employees should be treated."
Safeway,1d6oksdh71d0j000,3.0,"It is mandatory that you join the local union to work at Safeway---- something that I do not approve of since this ""drags"" down your hourly rate with monthly dues, etc."
Safeway,1d6mt5fm41d0j000,5.0,"The interview process moved quickly which I appreciated. Most employees have been there for years, which to me contributes to SFW's corporate culture."
Safeway,1d6lv9ev852ss800,3.0,When i first started at Safeway i Loved it but a couple of years while working there my manger left the store to a new younger man that wasn't to nice and didn't play far.
Safeway,1d6k2b8ieak8r800,4.0,Not enough money to live a normal life off of but the store owners are treat people it's just in a small town where money is very scarce unless you have a great job.
Safeway,1d6jdifik1d13000,4.0,Massive company with a very mixed employee field. The company in a whole is highly successful for a reason. Safeway served as a temporary employment while i was between jobs.
Safeway,1d6j9nhovaqgs800,4.0,"A typical day on the Night Crew at Safeway consists of clocking on and letting the night checker out to take over for them. If not checking, pulling the boards out from the back to put on the floor to break them down is what I would be doing. After breaking down the boards it is typically 1 A.M, when we close the store."
Safeway,1d6j6mkom24g3000,3.0,cool place to work. you get your hours but you don't get much hours a week because they are over staffed depending on where and what safeway you work at.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d6glnpqeb894801,4.0,"It is a good job but management and especially corporate management is stressed and not very professional. If you stay with the company long enough you can make a good living wage and good benefits. However, with the latest union contract it is much longer of a process to get raises and very hard to get full-time status."
Safeway,1d6gikvphak8r800,2.0,"I was hired as a full time GM Manager. Shortly after a new store manager was hired and cut me down to 28 hours a week in my department with no one else but me. one hour he scheduled me for 18 hours and still proceeded to complain that the job was not getting done. When I was full time my sales were 10-20% above the previous manager. at 18-28 hours per week sales were 10% under previous years. I was called out for this in-front of the ""full time"" Management team who actually received full time 48 hours per week. The environment upper management created was hostile and unprofessional. I left soon after."
Safeway,1d6gbtnd4h40n800,3.0,"My typical work day consisted of ordering product. Production baking of  breads, pies, donuts, muffins, and cookies.  I learned and practiced the golden rule in the bakery.  Safeway is very diverse work place.  The hardest part of the job was covering unreliable workers positions while covering my own responsibilities in the bakery.  The most rewarding part of the job was assisting customers and providing  awesome high quality baked goods."
Safeway,1d6e7oicob855800,5.0,good place to work worked in the deli at Safeway it was a seasonal summer job my first year of college great experience and great people to work with highly recommend
Safeway,1d6dmhvhbaqgs800,3.0,I worked briefly at a Safeway in Ft. Collins starting off as a courtesy clerk.  My manager was wonderful and was working with me to get into the bakery department but I had to move back to Colorado.  I did not work for Safeway again because of other employment.
Safeway,1d6c0b755ak8r800,4.0,Overall a good place to work. Could be a little more organized than it is currently. Other than that I enjoyed my time there. The fellow workers were both professional and friendly.
Safeway,1d6bu5c32brcr800,4.0,"If you have ever worked in a grocery store, especially a big one. Safeway runs the same way. We stock at night when there aren't many people around. It can become very tiring, especially when you are done with stacking and there is nothing else to do. It can become tiresome but overall it is a good place to work. The people were easy to communicate with."
Safeway,1d6bpclr8b855800,4.0,This is a place that tried to work with you and if you showed promise tried to advance you. they were friendly and seemed fair. It was also in the teamsters union.
Safeway,1d6bkaus1akcp800,4.0,"If you get the hang of your job task fast, that’s all you’ll need. The management when I worked there was bad, they worked off emotion and if you made them mad they would take all of your hours away. Higher up also like to take advantage of newer employees and make them do their job"
Safeway,1d6bfhqpnbrcr800,3.0,Bad place to work. I got next to no hours but worked almost every day of the week. the management is horrible and treated me like I didn't matter to them.
Safeway,1d6bfdij3b855800,5.0,Met some great people and furthered my skills and knowledge in a warehouse environment. Management was very helpful in increasing my skill set and helped with other opportunities moving up
Safeway,1d6auhtro5n90800,3.0,Each manager personally worked with was qualified for the position with different management styles and was capable to adapt accordingly during time there. General Directors were qualified to meet the needs of the store.
Safeway,1d6amtqjnb894800,2.0,Stressful disrespectful work place. On call. Huge job sites 2 small job sites. New crew almost everyday. Only if a Forman that abused their power doesnt put u down heel keep u
Safeway,1d6agkn5pb815800,5.0,"I usually stock shelf's and help customers with buying items and promoting sale items. I have learned how to better myself with customers and time management. The management is good, they know how to treat their employees and they will work with you if you are having issues. The workplace culture is awesome. They care about their employees and want to see them succeed in life and they make sure you are taken care of. The hardest part might be dealing with certain customers. I enjoy the people I work with and being proud of what I do."
Safeway,1d69li4orbrcp800,4.0,"Safeway is super fast pace which is nice cause your day goes by really fast. for the most part everybody in the departments are really nice and fun to work with its just the managers who are so rude and don't show appreciation nor do they just smile and say hi how is everything??? for the work we do at Safeway, the employees should get wat more respect."
Safeway,1d6871j7maqgo800,1.0,"There are too many managers and they are union members. How can the union represent both the workers and managers? The fee of $13.88 is entirely too high for the minimum wage salary and high school students. Each county gets paid a different wage, in Maryland, every area has the same cost of living."
Safeway,1d66u5h7bb80r801,3.0,"I loved working there. It was a great environment.  However, there was no help, training or assistants you had several jobs but only one small paycheck."
Safeway,1d66al8p9b84r800,1.0,"Worst management I’ve ever seen along with very low wages & no advancement. Store mgr came to work drunk, many employees high. If you’re a hard worker prepare to pick up lots of slack."
Safeway,1d64uk7rvb84r800,4.0,"Overall, Safeway was a good first job. I enjoyed learning and valuing the customer service skills I had learned along with running the register at a fast and efficient pace."
Safeway,1d63cks6eb80r800,5.0,"I enjoyed learning new things, meeting different people. I enjoyed feeling I was being helpful to the customers. I liked the flexibility to work around school."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d62lksikbrch800,4.0,i loved all my coworkers and it was like and extended family!!! managmet was very organised and reliable! Thet were willing to work around my school schedule and still give me good hours!!!
Safeway,1d61jehu7b80r800,2.0,I'd say the company should have there supervisors take some classes in ethics. If you don't mind not having the weekends off then this job is for you. Also the pay is not bad at all for this particular job.
Safeway,1d5vr3ca7brch800,4.0,I enjoyed working at the Safeway 1827 in La grande Oregon. Worked their for about two years before I moved for school. Payed each week on a Thursday and got hours when I needed them.
Safeway,1d5vnkt2tb84r800,2.0,never know what your week will be 20 hrs or ?????  Schedules are written bellow salary projections and then a person shows up for work and is asked to work more than scheduled... It can ruin your day but if you need the money you do what they ask.
Safeway,1d5vj9k8tb84r800,2.0,A lot of standing and walking around doing petty work. If you are looking for a job that isn't too depressing this isn't the one. If you are looking for a easy straight forward temporary job this is the one
Safeway,1d5v8b61qas0k800,3.0,"Safeway had mandatory training classes for their employees, especially those in management. The chance for advancement was there if you worked hard enough for it. I did find however, they tended to rarely recognize their employees for their achievements, but were quick to be negative instead. The reason that I left was for better hours somewhere else. I was a single mom with young kids and they kept promising daytime hours, but scheduling me late instead."
Safeway,1d5v5cheu52sh800,4.0,"The management was unfair and not clear on guidelines and rules. Also, many were unfairly favored in their hours they received. No benefits until over a year of working."
Safeway,1d5v4hud1b80r800,3.0,managers at Safeway don't look at you as a person but as a number.  they use you for the number of hours you work and when you're out you are just another customer.
Safeway,1d5v314cqb80r800,2.0,The job is hard work with 10 minute break.  Low hours low pay for really hard work.  No  choice for hours. Too hard to transfers. Don't give you first choice at jobs openings.
Safeway,1d5utucqjb88r800,1.0,"If you have kids- terrible place to work. There is no allowance for emergencies or child care issues.  It is also next to impossible to ever use sick day benefits, and you are told to work your 12 hour day anyway since no coverage. Management does not care if customers get ill. They do not allow breaks and you are not supposed to sit down at any point in a 12 hour work day as this is considered to appear lazy to customers."
Safeway,1d5ung89fbrch800,1.0,"Safeway is owned by Cerberus.  That should be a red flag right there.  For those who don't know, in Greek mythology, Cerberus is a three head demon dog that guards the underworld, devouring the souls of any dead person who tries to escape and any living person who attempts to enter.  It is a monster so evil that even Disney could not figure out a way to portray it in a lighthearted tone."
Safeway,1d5t86slcb84r800,1.0,"The whole time i worked there, there was no set management team. It was a new person every month, making it really hard to move up. They worked me like I was full time but I didn't have any benefits."
Safeway,1d5t55b22b88r800,1.0,it would be busy sometimes and sometimes it would be slow. managers and employees were nice and very friendly. expectations were a little high and soemtimes the demand was ridiculous
Safeway,1d5songf5b88r800,4.0,"Great company to advance and receive training. Above average pay, job security, benefits and responsibility. Very long hours and never ending work load from the corporate office."
Safeway,1d5sg55cbbrch800,3.0,Very less stressful place to work but you will most likely pull your hair out with the way management can be when it comes to paying there employees correctly
Safeway,1d5s29vevbrch800,4.0,Its a very quick paced work environment. Depending on the store that you work for your experience can differ greatly. Depending on seniority you may end up working holidays but the pay is great in exchange for working those days
Safeway,1d5s0vrgnakck800,3.0,"very strict. they don't trust you at all, always had to put receipt on everything purchased and questioned about anything brought from home. Just do the job and enjoy the customers."
Safeway,1d5rt1l36brch800,4.0,Safeway is a good company to work for. You can start at the bottom and work your way up to different departments. They are able to train and willing to give employees chances to learn different department job.
Safeway,1d5pufosdb88o800,4.0,"Just like anywhere most of the customers and other employees are great but there is always a few that are not so great. Its retail so it working late nights, holidays, and weekends."
Safeway,1d5pc7ejmakcj800,1.0,Management cares about thier bottom line only. The work model for the pharmacy at least in the short time I worked there was less help and more work they pushed this to the absolute extreme. In summary ypu work as hard as you possibly can with a team of two or three only to come in the next day with things worse off. This continues until the patient's are so angry they go to corporate. Then you get 2-3 extra people for a day get caught up only to have the whole cycle repeat again. Although they will hire uncertified technicians and train you with compensation for school.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d5p09icjakcj800,4.0,I love working for Safeway its just they are unfair with the new people if you already been working for them and you get into a incident with one of the old workers they choose their side I feel as doe that's unfair you let go of talent like that.
Safeway,1d5o8bpo61fdv000,1.0,"I absolutely hated working here, mostly because it always seemed like people only came to work to chit-chat and gossip and not get any real work done. Then complain about how nothing ever gets done."
Safeway,1d5o2m1h2aqgk800,2.0,"Not enough caring for employee and customer relations anymore. The best thing is that they offer union positions still. Every time you find a product you like, they seem to stop caring the item all together."
Safeway,1d5nq2qvsb80n800,4.0,"I had a good time here, the staff is friendly, and everyone got along fairly well I think. The environment was relatively fast-paced. In the starbucks kiosk it was irritating when working alone; no one could leave to retrieve something from the back unless another starbucks clerk was there. This was an issue when it was busy and something ran out of stock."
Safeway,1d5nkiufkb84n800,5.0,"Good place to work. Good pay. working with good people, team member. got good breaks and lunch. worked with cash. helping people out. i learn new things everyday. loved working with food."
Safeway,1d5nfpnm81fdv000,2.0,"Spent almost 2 years with safeway, would not recommend to anyone aside from a very short term, stop gap job. Was promoted from entry level courtesy clerk to cashier, never received actual pay increase that was owed after repeatedly asking my payroll person and store manager. Stuck around for a year like that, simply because my direct supervisor and store were good to me overall."
Safeway,1d5nefnqb1fdv000,5.0,For me Safeway was an excellent job. I was a single mom and the benefits were great. I worked hard but to accomplish a goal you must work hard. Once I  became a manager I learned more about people skills. I enjoyed my over all experience.
Safeway,1d5n93sffb88o800,5.0,fun nice to work there would really tell people about this job you get to meet a lot of people  and helping customers is really fun the hardest thing was the dumping the oil stocking was pretty easy  the work place culture is great some managers are great at least the ones i met
Safeway,1d5n0nher0mcu000,2.0,This is not an enjoyable place to work. Workers are barely trained and management is incompetent. The hierarchy at this store is a mystery. This job was disgusting and there was no care for me or the other workers who had to spend hours outside in all weather bringing in carts.
Safeway,1d5mniff9b84n800,3.0,My main duties as an Assistant Store Manager include:
Safeway,1d5ku7js11d1d000,1.0,"Eight years with this company and the only thing that matters is bottom line profit for the store manager and company profits. Consumer concern or employee relations are non-existent. If you have an education, steer clear of this company, drop-outs, are the rule and if you are a current or past drug user, I am sure you will rise within the ranks. Company prefers employees they can manipulate because they know of their limitations. Choose to excel, not to accept indignant treatment by corporate illiteracy. Horrible career choice! The only benefit is the contacts made with customers, the only saving grace!"
Safeway,1d5kthcvv0mtv000,3.0,"bad management, very hard to get a request day off or time off."
Safeway,1d5kf7g4i1d0u000,4.0,"You must have food out on time and at the right temperature and keep it rotated through out the day. you don't want to get caught being unfocused because, people consume your food and you represent the company."
Safeway,1d5i94fs01d0u000,2.0,"Too many  buyouts transitions with little to no communication from higher up.  Company is not as supportive of employees as they claim.  Reduces hours and manpower stating they dont have the money, then turn around with promotions for customers to hand out gift cards left and right."
Safeway,1d5hr35891bge000,2.0,Bad Experience for me it was my first  real job certain days I will call for my time they would give me a wrong time to come in or sometimes they wouldn’t let me know my times to come in at all so it would make me look like a bad person im not a bad person I love to work
Safeway,1d5g1f5ud1d0e000,2.0,"I worked in the deli department that warned me right from the get-go during my interview of the high turnover rate in the deli department. I had to find out the hard way. Atleast 5 employees came and went just within the 1 Year I worked in that department, and one walked out! Management of the store and the deli is awful and I would never recommend that position."
Safeway,1d5fnc6qmak4h800,3.0,",  coustmers are good most of the time. co workers are great, fast paced and even when its slow you keep busy. not consistant hours and low hours off and on"
Safeway,1d5fgl3lo0mtv000,2.0,"I had a pretty good expeirence for the first half of my time employed there. The pay was bad(min wage) considering we had to pay union dues, but the management was fair, they were pretty accommodative, decent hours for a high schooler, and manageable tasks. When the management had a change, that all changed as well. You had your hours drastically cut if you ever requested time off, management was extremely disrespectful to employees, and they started micro-managing simple tasks to the point where it became grueling to do things like clean the bathroom. Also, they are not good at pest control. I’ve seen ants in the donut case, a cockroach in the bakery, and the bread displays have mouse traps because it’s such a problem. I’ve heard other stores are better, and that’s probably true given my initial experience. It’s not necessarily worth giving it a chance as you will be making minimum wage while also paying union dues(their union is garbage)."
Safeway,1d5f1ujb31d1d000,1.0,Not my first choice more like my last. Would not recommend applying unless your a teen in need of chump change.most managers were veg in training and in overall duty's haveing workers doing things outside of job description tht the manager themselves should be doing
Safeway,1d5emq14p0mct000,3.0,"My work involved constant face to face interaction with concerned customers. There were challenging times, but my training helped me to be a quick thinker and great problem solver."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d5dteb3n1fdp000,5.0,"The employees are very friendly, and the work place is safe. Slow in the morning, but productive. I learned to be more respectful to the customers, and management. The bosses do a great job managing on the floor and off. The hardest part of the job for me is the carts. The most enjoyable about the job is saying high to the customers, and bagging for them."
Safeway,1d5dn6u8e1d1d000,1.0,The job sucks because union takes 2/3 of your paycheck while the rest is taken by taxes. Good luck trying to live in Santa Rosa California with paystubs like safeways
Safeway,1d5daj5pr1ahu000,4.0,They were a good employers for getting your foot in the door and good for learning good work ethic. The were rather accommodating to any help with scheduling.
Safeway,1d5d24gh11d0u000,5.0,Safeway is the greatest place I have ever worked.  They care so much about their employees and bend over backwards in order to keep them happy.  Thanks!
Safeway,1d5cnq6mh1d0e000,3.0,Work hard and accurately. Take advantage of union representation. Days go fast. Good discounts. Training for go getters. Can work multiple locations to increase hours.
Safeway,1d5c9erb30mtv001,4.0,It was a pretty typical retail job. I worked in the bakery department and set out all of the merchandise. I filled cake orders and kept stock on the inventory.
Safeway,1d5bip9rb1d0e000,3.0,Everyday was different. It was either a slow day or a fast paced day. The management was slacking and it made everything difficult when the managers weren't doing their job correctly.  The culture itself was mellow. No trouble with any employees.
Safeway,1d5bfghb31d1d000,3.0,I was a home shopper at vons and at one point my department manager was gone for over a month due to medical issues and the store manager refused to call in another manager and had myself and the employees of my department kind of just winging it. Myself and 2 others were slightly trained in what the managers responsibilities and we were able to do mostly everything but myself and those coworkers were doing the managers job without the managers pay and there were days where I had to work 12 hours due to the lack of employees in that department and the drivers who would pick up orders refusing to do their jobs
Safeway,1d5bd07861d0e000,1.0,poor staff poor job clean are poor managenet overallpoor job never enough employees always hiring poor rnd employees who never did their jobs i would never recomend
Safeway,1d5bce9m81d1d000,5.0,Worked over night graveyard shifts as a stocker with great Benefits and something that worked around my schedule specially with me having a kid it made my life easy
Safeway,1d5b9li8m0mte000,1.0,"But Albertsons Safeway was the most stressful job I have ever worked. The moment I got off of work I was counting down the hours until I had to be back. There was a constant sense of dread. There was no training or constructive criticism, the culture was he said she said, and heresay meant more than proven results. Perhaps it was the location, perhaps it's the culture of the company, but I would not recommend working for Albertsons Safeway."
Safeway,1d5alcis71d0u000,2.0,"Its a good first job, but like with most fast type places long term ends up becoming more displeasing. many of the employees have stopped caring about getting a good job done"
Safeway,1d5agmstoak4h800,3.0,I have to work with people who do not know how to effectively communicate. It is very frustrating. I do not recommend working here. It will not be a good experience if you are highly educated.
Safeway,1d5aftpqn0mte000,3.0,"No communication, the work was straightforward but excessive, constantly dealing with the schedule being rewritten without notice. The work itself was fine, and having a union made things better for the most part."
Safeway,1d5a1miv41d0u000,2.0,Recent Albertson's acquisition of Safeway has felt less labor friendly.
Safeway,1d5a0tlf81fdp000,2.0,"Management isn't very helpful. It's a great first job but not really a career job unless you make friends with everyone. Customers are really rude most the time but it is a customer service job so you have to be nice no matter what. Hour constantly change. They don't stick to giving you days off that you request off even if you give them a reason as to why you can't work those days. They get mad if you call out most the time, even if you're sick. There is no way to avoid at least one person getting mad by you calling out, just make sure to do it at least 4 hours in advance. Don't expect any special treatment unless you're close to the management."
Safeway,1d58ogkl01d0q000,5.0,"My manager (the only manager I will EVER address as ""Boss"") was just an AWESOME individual. Very humane, compassionate, & willing to WORK WITH YOU!"
Safeway,1d58n68mm1d0q000,5.0,Were i was it rained alot that was only the really bad part walking stuff to people’s cars.
Safeway,1d58ed37c1agr001,3.0,"pulling orders on a electic pallet jack, orders range from 2,000 to 5,000 pound and varies from dog food to can good, soda and tissue, and you building this on two pallet skids"
Safeway,1d57t2q811agr000,4.0,Always something exciting going on at Safeway.  I loved the management team and the people within the stores.  A good mix of cultures making it always nice to come to work.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d57l8di30mta000,3.0,"the management and job its self were ok. I was very basic work that didn't really produce much of a challenge. I really didn't like the management set up, because the managers were always in a room by themselves and anytime I had to go talk to them I felt like I was going to the principles office at school."
Safeway,1d57br2j60kbq000,3.0,"Job was average, just like any other corporation.  It was fine,  strictly speaking not much creativity involved.  All product was formatted unless I was lucky enough to get a customer who wanted something special.  Loved the challenge."
Safeway,1d561496k1d0q000,5.0,I started at a young age. Went through proper trainer and had patient leaders to follow. I leaned so much from all kinda of people and try to pass the same information down to the new hires.
Safeway,1d55p23u81d0q001,3.0,"My job at safe way was ok for a first job. i have no opinions otherwise. everything felt standard, hard at sometimes and fairly easy at others. i learned how to be responsible and hard working as to not disappoint my employer"
Safeway,1d55b10s71d0a001,3.0,I worked in starbucks and you don't get any of the benefits you would actually working at a strabuxks because its through safeway. So I think that is a little unfair.
Safeway,1d55atco41d0q000,4.0,Very reliable place too work but it may take years for any sort of pay advancement but when you do get a pay bump it is quite significant. Many different positions available.
Safeway,1d54r264i1d19000,3.0,"Management gets switched around a lot. Same with employees, high turnover rate. But coworkers that stick around you'll laugh together about irate customers. If you're not getting enough hours in one department you can cross train in another."
Safeway,1d53drsga1ba2000,5.0,safeway had great opportunities to offer for promotions and educational career building travel time to help other stores and great discount percentage
Safeway,1d52ns57i1fdi000,3.0,They changed my schedule without telling me.
Safeway,1d52l00f81fdi000,4.0,"Pretty good job, mostly polite customers, as well as polite coworkers. Occasionally worked overtime to meet expectations, or above and beyond. Just expect to move a lot."
Safeway,1d523cm6i1d0i000,1.0,Was not a very nice place to work. It was nice at first but i had a whole 2 weeks of vacation robbed from me because even though i tried to make sure it was my time to take it and upper management telling me it was fine to take it it was not actually and i lost 2 weeks of pay for no reason
Safeway,1d50n68jm1agi000,5.0,My supervisor was one of the best. He always helped me out when I needed it. He always made sure that his employees were happy and not stressed. All of the managers were great as well
Safeway,1d50grp9c1d12000,2.0,"My big problem was that it got to the point where I was only sleeping about 2 hours a night because the hours were all over the place.  I wasn't trying to get a 9-5 job with weekends off, because I only got it to get out of the house, but while I was there its was like you would work one day from 5 am to 1 pm and then the next shift would be 11 pm to 7 am and then the next shift would be 3 am a day later.  My days off would just be me trying to figure out how to take a nap without making myself unable to fall asleep that night for work the next morning."
Safeway,1d4tqivqa0mti000,4.0,Enjoyed working with the customers at Safeway enjoy working with my co-workers at Safeway and with management enjoy stocking the product it was a nice place to work for
Safeway,1d4to80221ba2000,3.0,"A typical day there would consist of breaking down your loads when you got there at 5am or earlier. After bring it down from the dock area. When I was there it felt like a morgue. The manager at the time made it feel all dead in there. She did not like most of her staff, she felt that if she were to get rid of some of the staff, it would make the store better. It didn't. That was the hardest part of the job, seeing great people fired for nothing. The enjoyable parts of the job, was summer time, that's when Conifer really came alive. What I learned, was to keep your head down and try not to make any mistakes."
Safeway,1d4tl0s8v1d12000,5.0,"Safeway is a good place for someones first job and can be highly productive, pay is alright but is enough to get you by."
Safeway,1d4tdclr91d02000,5.0,Working at Safeway gave me the opportunity to meet so may new people and learn a lot about different cultures. Because of all of the different departments it gave me the opportunity to get experience in so many different areas.
Safeway,1d4tbv89f1d0i000,5.0,working at safeway was nice and I learned a lot.. was hired as a courtesy clerk then when to the bakery department. and learned new things. the managers and supervisor were nice and had a lot of informations to give u.
Safeway,1d4rt0r9j1agi000,3.0,"As the title says, Safeway is an alright place to work. Nothing special. Expect to get let go in a New York minute, should you not be able to make it in to work due to the roads being closed though."
Safeway,1d4rqitfj1fdi000,2.0,Good job for in highschool and part-time work. Would not pay more even though I did more work. Stopped working around my school schedule. Other employees report same treatment about performing work outside of listed duties and not receiving proper pay
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d4r7bj511d0i000,4.0,"The work itself was never too much or anything difficult. Some days would be worse than others, depending on typical things like how busy it is, or if there were sick calls that day or not. The only thing that I didn't like about this job was the management. They would really take advantage of me sometimes. They would over work me or make me work a shift that I couldn't work, because everyone else would call in sick for the said shift. The only reason I left was because it started to interfere with my school and that is more important than the job to me."
Safeway,1d4r398eb1agi000,2.0,"Always told to ""step up my game in my department"".  Could never accomplish that due to being called to the cash register for half of my shift.  Expectations were super high for not being able to supervise my area."
Safeway,1d4pj8skg1d0i000,1.0,"Worked for 2 years for this company, I recommend NOT working for them if you have any self worth. Started out as a full-time employee while in college classes full-time, they were very flexible with scheduling and worked around last minute requests, which was the one positive. pay advancement for the two years I worked here was non existent, I received a raise of five cents in all even with position advancement and increased responsibilities. Union benefits were non existent do to scheduling patterns to keep me at part time for most of my employment, I would have 40 hours for a week then drop to 28 the next even with open availability. I worked for multiple locations and experienced the same at each one."
Safeway,1d4okc2iu1d0i000,2.0,relaxed place not hard  or boring if you enjoy daily customers and working in food service .  hardest part is early mornings when  its really busy non stop customers
Safeway,1d4o547sc1d12000,3.0,everyday i come into work and 9 times out of 10 i will be short staffed or my staff will work very short shifts. The work expected to be done every night by each individual is very unreasonable. I feel like my management doesn't want to help me in any way or talk to me.
Safeway,1d4o41rnj1ba2000,4.0,"Fast paced work environment. standard Stationary engineer position. Took care of boilers, chillers fire system etc... Liked the job just too many double shifts and weekend work."
Safeway,1d4nltbf21agi000,5.0,i arrived at work at 5 am shoveled the frozen ice into the seafood case then set up all the fresh seafood stocked freezers and shelves assisted customers
Safeway,1d4mllifub88r800,4.0,Just a average checking job. You have your ups and downs based on customers. General pretty good experience can get crazy durring holiday but that's about normal.
Safeway,1d4mhhc6jb80u800,4.0,The Food Retail Business is a very competitive fast past environment. I have been in retail since I was 16 years old learning all the competencies it takes to manage a multi million dollar food retail store. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I get to promote one of my employees to a new position.
Safeway,1d4m52thbb80u800,5.0,"I helped customers,cleaned equipment, and stocked meat."
Safeway,1d4lvpe1qb84u800,3.0,"a lot of pressure and under staffed due to economy, people and co worker's are friendly.good times bad time at safeway. mostly bad times. a lot of absent ties and people getting hurt and and being intimated to stand up for them selves me included,"
Safeway,1d4jsb6qfbrct800,3.0,Working for Safeway was a good first job experience. I wouldn't want to stay there though. It wasn't compatible with my Autism Spectrum Disorder. Other than that OK.
Safeway,1d4hce2qqb84q800,5.0,Typical day was driving produce to clients all over phoenix.
Safeway,1d4h4qvvcb88o800,1.0,"Working at Safeway was a nightmare. The employee retention is a joke, people either work there for <1 year or 10+ years. The management at my store was an absolute joke, and from what I've heard, it's universal. They run on skeleton crews to make it look like they're getting more done with lower costs, and then they get mad at you when 1 person can't complete the workload that should be spreas among at least 3 people. Hours vary so wildly, I've gone from working 4 hours in one week to working 40+ the next. The pay is absolutely not worth it, and they like to train everyone to be a cashier so they can have even less people on the clock, because they can just call up the stockers whenever there's more than 3 people in a line (which is at all times)."
Safeway,1d4gjfvbrb84q800,4.0,"Safeway is a great shopping center, but as an employee it's a lot of things in a work place that should not be held as a conversation."
Safeway,1d4gflbv0b84q800,1.0,They are not diversity inclusive. They shamelessly suppress the production of store workers for self gratification of bonus pocket payments. They also undermine all safely rules and regulations for the sake of bonus payments. The union enables non-production for self-serving of their pay check via union dues with representation for the unionized employees.
Safeway,1d4gador752ss800,4.0,At safeway warehouse its very fast paced job only the strong can survive. You gotta have that hunger or ambition to want to get that money in order to do it.
Safeway,1d4g1djou52ss800,4.0,"great people, not the best hours! Hours vary constantly, and you never know what you are going to get. My manager was great, and genuinely cared about my well being"
Safeway,1d4ef6s52b88o800,4.0,"This was my first paid job, and the reason why I would work at this firm is that they taught me how to apply effort into the position as a bakery clerk."
Safeway,1d4e3irtu5ncs800,5.0,Safeway is a great place to be. The workers are very friendly and super sweet. They always go above and beyond to help you no matter what you need....
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d4dqkferb88o800,4.0,"When I applied, I got a call for an interview within a couple hours, and got the job right away. Early on, hours were good - 40 hours/week, 8/day, consistent hours and days. After a few months, someone from the regional office came in and had problems with the situation and hours had to be cut. This has dropped me down to less than 20 hours/week, about 4/day working 3-4 days a week. While the wage isn't bad, it's not enough to live on, and it's unlikely to get more hours any time soon."
Safeway,1d4atac1aak93800,2.0,A typical work day at Safeway includes lack of security short breaks to non some of the time. I've learned that my safety and health is more important that getting a pay check. The lack of professionalism gets tiring and frustrated quick. The hardest part of the job was trying to stay busy and occupied when there where very few customers.
Safeway,1d4a9ratub80q800,1.0,"Just the nastiest old ladies looking so disgruntled all the time run the place it's so unpleasant. Work environment is petty and dramatic. It truly is amazing being a high schooler but feeling like the only adult in the room by the way these woman seriously act! wouldn't wish this upon my worst enemy and won't accept 7.25 as a reasonable, livable wage."
Safeway,1d49pu2j1b84q800,3.0,"I can only speak for the operations of the Deli.   One of the biggest  problem areas is in the sub-contracted section of the deli, whose employees bare no responsibilities for the deli  To the average customers, they look like they're standing around and ignoring them."
Safeway,1d49etk5ub80q800,1.0,"Great pay but very demanding, the district manager was terrible and ultimately decided to leave because of him. Has bad people skills and works you to the bone with no appreciation."
Safeway,1d49ajhpeak52800,4.0,It was a good first job. The manager didn't like that I couldn't work much during the school year. The other managers had me do things that weren't in my job description but you get used to it.
Safeway,1d498pn3lb84q800,4.0,Safeway was an ok place to work. It did however change when the merger with Albertsons took place. I did like Safeways policies better than the new Albertsons policies.
Safeway,1d477k9trb84q800,3.0,If you like retail its ok. I was a bagger. So I had to learn the basics of packing groceries without making a mess. Management was pretty nice.
Safeway,1d46s5vt852ss800,3.0,"I believe that they could improve on security and a more friendly work environment. I learned somethings about working in a customer service based environment but I feel as though I have more to, and willing, to learn."
Safeway,1d46ljjvqbrcq800,1.0,"Good benefits but albersons and Safeway merged this caused all form of confusion. Lack of communication, many changes, cutting back hours. Which caused alot of hostilities. Refusing to work with the unions didn't help. This has many employees as well as customers unhappy."
Safeway,1d46hh62hak93800,4.0,The job was my first and it left a good impression on me for what to expect in a grocery store;  it led me to finding another grocery store with better pay but over time my second job in a grocery store became something i dreaded.
Safeway,1d4606lh1ak52801,5.0,"Enjoyed working at this company. Was able to work way up the rank going through company Retail Leadership program. Enjoyed the grocery business, and all the different opportunities it allowed. A lot of hours for the salaried employee."
Safeway,1d45oik8nakh0800,1.0,I’ve had about 4 different managers since I’ve been working there within the passed 2 years and all of them were horrible. If a manager doesn’t like you they will definitely mess with your hours. If your not a part of the union they’ll definitely mess with you in any way they can if you annoy them.
Safeway,1d45gs0ncak93800,5.0,I enjoyed working as a pharmacist for Safeway and would still be with the company today but our  store was sold and then closed down.Our local and out of state management team was very supportive and always available to address our needs.
Safeway,1d44of8sibrcq800,1.0,"constant negative attitude from all employees and managers that creates a depressing atmosphere. No wage increases, and a constant habit of trying to give more work without compensation. Learned how to work under pressure and how to communicate with customers and coworkers to resolve problems with very little support from coworkers/managers."
Safeway,1d44a6m6cak4v800,2.0,"Working at Safeway was a daily struggle.  My store was understaffed and poorly managed.  Hours were frequently inconsistent, which made it difficult to manage my monthly expenses.  Department managers were friendly and attentive to customer's needs.  Store manager had ineffective customer and employee relations skills."
Safeway,1d4409rd8brcn800,4.0,"A typical day at work was fast paced throughout the whole day (unless night shift). I learned how to work with various equipment and different types of foods. My first job with Safeway; the management was great! However, when I transferred, the management lacked a lot of things required to run a successful store. I never really paid attention to the work place culture, but it seemed balanced. The hardest part of my job was trying to keep up with all the closing tasks while trying to please the customers at the same time. The most enjoyable part of this job is pleasing the customers and having the feeling of happy satisfaction."
Safeway,1d43vss3b52sl800,5.0,Safeway was a very great place for me to work I wish I didn't have to leave the staff were so nice and there were lots of people my age so I didn't feel alone.
Safeway,1d43vlt60b80n800,3.0,I enjoy working with the employees in all departments at Safeway.  The scheduling is not what I prefer.  It is difficult to plan ahead in my personal life due to the scheduling.
Safeway,1d43l1dppb88l800,4.0,"I liked working there, My boss was a little up tight but all in all in was a great place to learn new skills."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d4284d5lb84n800,5.0,"I loved my job I got to cut fruits and veggies all day while listening to my favorite music, and when I would go out to the floor I was surrounded with awesome co workers. It was a comfortable job. I also enjoyed the general management position."
Safeway,1d41gaoc5b88j800,2.0,"The employees are unhappy here, there is too much theft, and it seems that there is a bad turn over rate, and the managers are constantly stressed out. However, on the upside, while I worked there, other employees taught me how to cut fruit with power-tools, so that was fun. They just don't seem to care. They didn't give the proper training to employees and there was outdated food available for purchase. A typical day was just clocking in, doing your work, having lunch. 10min break, clock out, and then you go home. Morale between employees was low, everyone was always unhappy. The hardest part of working there was having to be in such a negative environment constantly. The best part of the job was that I got out of the house for a while."
Safeway,1d41fvlkf5j4h800,4.0,"Worked in multiple departments. Learned enough to be able to move on to another company and advance quickly. Face paced, friendly environment. Highly recommend for a first time employee"
Safeway,1d41fmeppakgk800,1.0,I had a fun time working there and it set me good while I was in school. The managers are cool and it isn’t an overwhelming job to where work stresses you out.
Safeway,1d412arfnb80l800,1.0,"I would not recommend working here, the employees were all catty and the manger didn’t care about the employees  at all , it was disappointing seeing how they treated the employees"
Safeway,1d3vgtsv7brcl801,3.0,"Typical day would be alright. For first job I did learn a lot of new things. Management is okay in some departments but some have some problems. Workplace is good, most of people are friendly and helpful."
Safeway,1d3vbv6bsbrcl800,3.0,Hours are based on seniority in each individual departments but learn different departments to gain hours.  This will also help if you want to advance in the company.
Safeway,1d3up4c71b80l800,2.0,"When hired on two separate occasions with Safeway, I can honestly and wholeheartedly say that you really shouldn't expect to be told much of anything of importance."
Safeway,1d3ukd99pb88j800,4.0,"It was an ok job. we were forced to scrub walls in 120 degree weather. Its hot during summers and you have to get carts. However, the customers make it worth it."
Safeway,1d3sfj7qub84l800,5.0,"Fun and fast paced work place. I learned patience, multitasking. I had to serve the customers as well as ring them up. I had to cook and prepare the food and sandwhichs and the salads as well as the chicken."
Safeway,1d3sd4pn8brcl800,3.0,I was promoted when i asked to move up which was great.  Lots of unnecessary drama that i as a manager noticed effected the other employees in many ways.
Safeway,1d3qbei74brcl800,5.0,"I like me working here. Lots of learned experience, good benefits for specialized unions, good hours, fair raises and lots of vacation time the longer you are with the company. Good discount and perks on holidays (holiday parties, lunches, buffets)."

Safeway,1d3pgkm3fbrcl800,2.0,"Safeway is a learn as you go company: the upside is that for a self motivated person like myself, I was able to learn quickly and apply my skill set to earn more money. The down side is there are no set policies and procedures which cause confusion and bad feelings among the various departments."
Safeway,1d3p9murnb88j800,5.0,I had a great time during my time at Safeway. There was always good energy in the bakery. The management was very mindful when it came to scheduling. It was all love.
Safeway,1d3p4mc8ob84l800,4.0,Loved working with safeway. The only reason I left was due to my transfer falling through when we moved to washington state. Look all management teams have good and bad team members. I have been lucky to have a majority of the good ones.
Safeway,1d3p4kr59brcl800,1.0,would not refer anyone to work there
Safeway,1d3mmf15ias0l800,2.0,It was a stressful environment. I was made the morning manager and dealing with all the money balancing was stressful and hard. Many times money was not were it was supposed to. Work environment was not good

Safeway,1d3l35rko1d0f000,1.0,"Toxic/snake pit environment.  It is not what you know or how you perform, but who you know and how well you kiss ___.  Lots of favoritism.  Poor upper management.  Stand on your feet all day, rarely get breaks on time, understaffed, no reviews or chance for time related wage increases, theft, and rude customers to name a few.. Having to deal with rude customers daily that take advantage of the situation meaning that they know that you can not defend yourself due to the fact that you are at work."
Safeway,1d3l14lqdbrcg800,3.0,Working at Vons Dot.com you never know if you will get hours or not. Most of the time I work up 3- 4 hours a day. If we are busy then i at least 6 hours but never pass 8 hours.
Safeway,1d3kunkgmbrcg800,3.0,"I worked for Safeway in Flagstaff, directly across from NAU. it was great, I only have memory of one bad customer the whole time i worked there, and she was angry over something I had no control over. 90% of the customers were about my age, so I was very comfortable the majority of the time. If they offered me more pay, I'd debate going back to them."
Safeway,1d3kq5dt71d0f000,5.0,Management did not really focus on team work. Kind of divided atmosphere. The store has a high turn out rate. I did not see managers focused on a high retention rate.
Safeway,1d3k9l32takgi800,5.0,Management was very understanding with the balance of family and work.
Safeway,1d3k4m7l91d0f001,5.0,I worked for Safeway for 5 years right after graduating high school. I worked in several departments including frozen foods manager and front end manager (customer service). It was a great job.

Safeway,1d3iko2jo1d1b001,3.0,Larger company to work for. The are union but they are so large that sometimes it felt like you didn't know everyone. Not awesome for scheduling minors that are still in school.
Safeway,1d3hrvmk81fdu000,2.0,I feel they should of had more people working the closing hours shifts. The store was in high demand of customers nit enough employees to close. We were always doing at least 3 jobs each. Could be very stressful at times.
Safeway,1d3hq964r1baf000,5.0,"flexible with hours, great place to work to gain experience, recommend for students looking for a job to work around their school schedules, many departments to transfer to"
Safeway,1d3hm9uk31d1b000,4.0,"Working here was a pretty standard, pre-high school graduation job. I showed up after my last class of the day for a shift of 4-8 hours. It was fun, but still work. I made a lot of good lifelong friends at that job, the first outside school or family. I really got to know the people of the neighborhood, as well. My general work day at safeway had been to arrive after school, change into my uniform and head up front, where I bagged groceries and offered take-out assistance, occasionally rounding up carts from the lot, or going out on litter patrol. After about six months, I began working a closing shifts, where I'd add a lot of vacuuming and sweeping and garbage emptying to the end of my night."
Safeway,1d3hjj4jq1d0d000,5.0,"fast paced, muti based punctual, always on the go, customer service a+ attendance hours always vary when it becomes a career your co workers become like family. sometimes need to work overtime but not rarely"

Safeway,1d3g5a3f81d0t000,4.0,"Secure but lack advancements, managements are fairly approachable but all depends on the store, and stores vary significantly from location to location."
Safeway,1d3f19hh4ak4h800,3.0,My time here was hectic and stressfilled from.being told two sets of rules because I was a Barista in the safeway store. And trying to adhear to both rule sets was not possible as some rules and regulations clashed.
Safeway,1d3d3fppa1d0d000,3.0,Work place culture was great. typical work day is about an 8hr shift with breaks. Management was always helpful. Most everyone willing to help out in all departments.
Safeway,1d3d35b5cakgg800,3.0,Went from a global major supermarket retailer to a privately owned company with much smaller footprint. Cannot
Safeway,1d3d1j3841d1b000,2.0,"The store manager would rather have male managers, would only back a male manager when issues arise, coworkers would rather talk bad about each other then help each other out."
Safeway,1d3cmstls0mtv000,2.0,"Good workers who know their worth don't stay long. Management and corporate take advantage of good workers who are willing to work extra hours and take on more responsibility than they are trained for. I was told I would only be stepping up as a shift manager for ""two weeks tops"" until they hired a new full time manager, and I ended up working as shift manager for months with out any pay raise or official promotion."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d3ck7bkt1d0d000,3.0,It was a good union job for a long time but very hard to get full time status due to union and store politics you can do twice the work but if somebody had more years than you they got the hours good pay and excellent benefits
Safeway,1d3cbf0dn1d0d000,1.0,"Okay, sooo... When I got hired I thought it was gonna be a good gig, right? In hindsight I was so wrong! First, I wasn't even shown how to do my job properly and often left to fend for myself (though my co-workers were always quick to be the first to point out that I botched something up without telling/showing me how to fix said mistake and making sure that I knew how to do it.)"
Safeway,1d3bimcoj1fdu000,1.0,It's always difficult to work in a retail environment. But Safeway takes the cake. it's survival of the fittest. There's really no other way to put it.
Safeway,1d3au0jih1d0d000,2.0,"While I worked my but off to get promoted in a short time frame, there hasn't been any where near enough people in my department and no repurcussions for the current employees continuoully doing a bad job. So while we have vocalized for months we need people, the job(s) and too much of the responsibility falls on my shoulders. Due to call outs and not near enough staffing, my shifts are typically 9-10 hours apart. Currently, I have no life outside of my job and that's no way to live."
Safeway,1d3an0l201d0t000,5.0,"Would rather not say I love the people I work with we are very good friends and look forward to seeing them, I am not going to say anything bad about this company and I am still employed by this company"
Safeway,1d3a6ieocakcg800,4.0,Good insurance even though it was with the union. At least it is affordable. Did not like that you could not get rid of useless employees without a paper trail a mile long.
Safeway,1d38b6ckv1fdu000,2.0,Working for Safeway was amazing. After the Albertsons buy out it took a turn for the worse. The way Albertsons runs their company is no good in my opinion.
Safeway,1d37bc6am1baf000,1.0,Store management is good but pharmacy management needs work. Not enough staff creating a stressful work environment. Insurance benefits a plus. Retirement plan a plus.
Safeway,1d370teqkakgg800,2.0,Worked at Safeway for three months a few years ago. We always had horrendous rushes from very large groups coming in from a neighboring safeway. Was a very stressful environment when I was there. Good coworkers though.
Safeway,1d36l504fakgg800,3.0,"a typical day at safeway consisted of long lines through the aisles, not many cashiers working at the time so supervisors would get on the register while manger just told us what to do and never fixing any problems or he was never there."
Safeway,1d34c4paj1d0d000,2.0,"Safeway used to be a great company to work for; over the years, and particularly since being bought by Albertsons’s, it has become intolerable. Severe labor-hour cuts by senior management causes prescription production to become backed up, which leads to justifiably angry customers. This constant negativity leads to poor morale among staff. So many good people have quit, and the ones who remain are miserable and unmotivated."
Safeway,1d33kkq981d0d000,3.0,"As far as retail jobs go, you can do far worse than this. Health benefits and 401k are included upon union membership, with the added bonus of job security. You can change your hours and job position with ease, and the work is not taxing at all. As a consequence, however, work days become very monotonous and it may become apparent that the meager paychecks do not justify working such a tedious job. Management is often uncommunicative and reluctant to implement changes such as equipment repair and ordering new stock. Look elsewhere if you're looking for a long-term job, otherwise you might end up trapped here with no bright future ahead of you."
Safeway,1d33buqvd1d1b000,3.0,It was a OK place to work.  I work in the deli and we had are busy day and we also had  are slow  day.   I cook  the fried chicken  and i had make sure the hot case filled.  I think  the hardest part  of my job. Was having to change the oil in the fryers.  I felt like they made me do everything while other deli Assocate didn't   have to do everything.
Safeway,1d32n3un21ahn000,5.0,"Great pay incentives and managing staff ....they reallylook out for the employees, it's a competitive team so the daily energy levels are highand  intense. Great atmosphere and supervision team really gets the job done"
Safeway,1d306dg7b1d0n000,3.0,"Working at Safeway was good for gaining experience in the retail field of work. However only working part time at minimum wage was just not going to cut it. I have no complaints about my job nor the people I worked with, they were all very kind and helpful during my time there. I simply need a job that pays more and gives me full time."
Safeway,1d2vs39ik1bg8000,2.0,"Safeway used to be one of the better places to work, but things went steep downhill after Albertsons's merger.  Employees are constantly hit with unrealistic goals and metrics with less and less tools to achieve them. Corporate greed, just like any other chains."
Safeway,1d2vgaheg1d0n000,3.0,all in all this is a fine place to work if you don't mind monotony. But the job offers benefits and the hours are flexible. coworkers weren't to bad either
Safeway,1d2u0rbht1d16000,1.0,"Used to have a good management, coworkers are good but not the management. now every week of your schedule expect that the manager are going to called you off 2 to 3 times every week. They only want you to work for like atleast 12 - 20 hrs per week. And They kept hiring new drivers and cut all the hours of the other drivers that has been there for a long time. Not a place to stay. Very poor management."
Safeway,1d2u03jid0mcn000,2.0,"This wasn't a great work environment, I didn't like working there. It was convenient but that's about it. I don't recommend it and wouldn't return for any reason."
Safeway,1d2ten16k1fdm000,3.0,I have been with safeway for 10 years and i do enjoy it but the management turnover is rough. some managers make you feel good about your work and others accuse you of things without proof. typical day at my store is super busy and usual not enough people on staff.  during my union lunch i'm still expected to answer phones and help people. i get called and texted on my days off without pay
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d2teci3n1fdm000,4.0,"As a Service Desk Manager my position was very hectic. I was in charge of money orders, lotto, Western Union, invoice cataloging, dr cleaning, employee violation signatures collected and many more responsibilities. With that said, I absolutely loved the fast paced and busy schedule that I was responsible for."
Safeway,1d2te9thn1d16000,3.0,"A grocery store goes through many phases throughout the day: the methodical yet fast-paced preparation, constant maintaining of products, waves of customers asking multiple things at once, the consistent cleaning. It all wears on a person's body and soul after awhile, if it weren't for the strong sense of community among fellow employees. We enjoy speaking about ourselves as we prepare products for customers, sharing laughs and encouragements throughout the day. The management does their best to be open-minded and understanding. Overall, the work itself is not easy, but we get through it every day just a little wiser."
Safeway,1d2taq3k91d07000,3.0,"This is a job that doesn't require much of any real skills as most can be acquired while working, but although work became routine and so it became easy to go to work regardless of the early or late shifts i was working. Management was difficult to get things through such as vacation or time off, but overall friendly and semi professional workplace."
Safeway,1d2t5gjs71d0n000,5.0,"Safeway is a very good and fun relaxed place to work, it is also serious and stressful but it was a good place to work friendly employees and the management know how to do their job, their cashiers need to work a little fast and be kinder towards the customers but overall I liked working for that company."
Safeway,1d2sr0jl91fdm000,3.0,"Worked off the one on Camino Del Sur Store #3323 and Sarah (the manager at the time I worked there) did a HORRIBLE job placing people in departments. The reason why we had horrible sales was because we did not have enough people equipped in each department making sure that customers are getting in and out in a timely manner. The only reason why I stayed so long was for my coworkers who were willing to step in and assist whenever I needed. Overall, would not recommend this job to anyone unless they are desperately seeking their first job as a high schooler but even then you are taken advantage of."
Safeway,1d2sqrbo31fdm000,2.0,Not the best job agency. Hours were minimal and the management did not handle situations correctly. Left to seek a better employment opportunity somewhere else.
Safeway,1d2qa0o4g1bg7000,1.0,"Bad, was forced to work overtime (off the clock) every night. Either I stayed two hours after on the clock or clocked out right at 10 (when I was supposed to). They were very upset about that and threatened to slash my hours. All of the other deli clerks would trash the place and expect me to clean up WHILE tending to customers at the same time. Hazardous work environment."
Safeway,1d2ori4251fdl000,4.0,You do the best you can with what every your're handed and never complain. It's a blessing to have a Job anywhere that pay's enough to live on and not have any worries. I love working with people and meeting new people of all backrounds. I love learning new things while helping out where ever needed to make a different.
Safeway,1d2oph12f1d15000,3.0,It is always a lot of work with not a lot of help. However if you really need a job they will always be there so I cant say much bad about them. I do wish they didn't change so much over the years. They used to be a really good company to work for.
Safeway,1d2ltav8k1bg7001,2.0,"Store manager was nonexistent, just leeching off of his guaranteed salary pay while the rest of the managers pick up the slack that they're not responsible for and don't have the time for."
Safeway,1d2kvf8681fdl000,4.0,The management was amazing.
Safeway,1d2komlnp1bg7000,5.0,Everyone is so nice and professional I’ve never had a complaint since working for them. Friendly n willing to working with they employees. Always offer more clients
Safeway,1d2jr57m41d15001,3.0,I enjoyed my time working for Safeway but unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any room to move up. Good people but the corporation should honor it's employee's time better. At the end of the day I felt the Union took more than I received.
Safeway,1d2j9ru0b1d15000,3.0,A typical day at work would be me entering to the department and looking around and seeing what customer needs my help first. Then I would help in the back most of the time take out the trash or wash dishes will my usual time of work. Management wasn't bad its just the communication between the department manager and the manager of the store was terrible and everything was all over the place. Hardest part of the job would have to be carrying heavy loads of stuff . Enjoyable part was if you actually got respectable customers lol .
Safeway,1d2iv19ea1fdl000,3.0,"Hours were constantly changed, they said their hours were dispersed between everyone depending on who worked their longest, those who just started getting fewer hours but that's not always how it worked."
Safeway,1d2i2d7441agm000,5.0,Safeway offered many opportunities to move up in the company! Promote working as a team. Everyday is different. Allows creativity for sales & marketing.
Safeway,1d2h6m5uo1d0l000,4.0,"I like working there for many reasons, they provide some good benefits, and I like helping people and satisfate their demand daily. In addition, I built a strong relationships with a lot of customres who like my services and my behavior."
Safeway,1d2ginbrr1d0l000,3.0,Challenging place to work. Loved my coworkers. Paid vacation and sick time. Good benifits flexible hours. Very busy and the holidaya and during the summer.
Safeway,1d2gdnnjk1ah6000,4.0,Full management expectations were not always provided.  I learned to not always proceed without ensuring management was on board.  I learned management was to be provided with a problem along with my suggested solutions.
Safeway,1d2gc2e071fdk000,2.0,management is full of stress and they want to pick for small things. visits all the time
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d28vhs1fbrdo800,1.0,"The company cares little to none about its employees, but you coworkers make things at least slightly tolerable, They wont give you any hours no matter how much you beg, or how hard you work"
Safeway,1d28lsumtbrdo800,3.0,"I start off my day by making fried chicken, slicing meat, making sandwiches and then clean up by the end of the night. Ive also learned many new things on how to use the meat slicer and not only that but on how to fry and season chicken but thats technically all I learned frankly. Management on a RARE occasion would be really happy but most of the time they just stay angry or just not having a good day in general, they don't care about their workers and even if they try to its already too late.  the schedule was always random, and even when asking for requested days off they would never give it to us and us co-workers would have to find a way to see if they would like to exchange hours for the day off. The hardest part of the job was to handle with all the customers requests but once we all got through that then everything goes smooth sailing and the most enjoyable part of the job was without a doubt clocking out, just a sigh of relief knowing that its all over."
Safeway,1d27vbcd7b89o800,1.0,"At first they make you feel wanted and give you praise. Then they cut your hours, and state corporate forced them. Never know your schedule until Friday. Planning doctor appointments are nightmares due to inconsistency in days. No family time. To get promoted you must go to nights. The night crew manager is unbearable. She expects you to throw 40 cases an hour plus face an aisle in under 30 minutes. check customers out, dump trash, and clean the back room. We are human not machines. Was constantly written up for petty things. Gave two weeks and never looked back."
Safeway,1d26ae2cob89o800,3.0,I enjoyed talking to the customers but my manager was very unhappy with my fellow coworkers helping the customers in the store because she felt that it was slowing us down from completing our work. What a joke!
Safeway,1d25i5ek75ncn800,3.0,"I work at night, the nights are usually slow paced, and very calm. I learned many different ways to deal with customers, and how to treat them respectively. What I also learned is how to deal with money in a faster pace. The workplace is just like any other grocery store except you have your own personal space. Which makes it a comfortable environment to work at too. Hardest part of the job is the fast pace with the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is when things get really calm, and empty."
Safeway,1d256efp65j59800,5.0,I worked under the direct supervison of the store manager. I learned the importance of a tidy and clean store... I liked helping customers with shopping purchases...
Safeway,1d24dsjqgbrdo800,4.0,Helping customers fine certain food products as well as assisting customers with bagging their groceries and if needed assisting with carrying out their groceries.
Safeway,1d23s4suqbrdo800,3.0,"It was a decent job, being a courtesy clerk wasn't the best but it could of been worse. Didn't like management but Co workers were good. Enjoyed working there for the most part."
Safeway,1d23me83ab81u800,1.0,"I wanted to work at Safeway because my grandmother worked there for 35+ years. Not the same standards and customers were not made to feel like they would enjoy the store's overall experience. Heavy turnover with employees. Too many managers, not enough training. Hours were cut to 10 per week."
Safeway,1d23a8n8laqhc800,1.0,no transparent department policy /always follow what other company does-never leads/upper management not in harmony with one another/ no work ethics or interpersonal relationships/ cutthroat workplace /no lunch break/cares only sales
Safeway,1d233lvfsb85t800,4.0,"A typical day at work as a Courtesy Clerk, you will clock in, sweep twice every hour, clean the bathroom once each shift, clean deli area, bag, help customers and collect carts through out your shift."
Safeway,1d22s2qeo52te800,1.0,"Hmm, I don't know where to start. Poor management, stressful environment, hectic hours, don't care whether you parttime or not, you work till you drop, no respect for employees, one person works for three shifts, on and on and on"
Safeway,1d21t4necb85t800,3.0,Good coworkers and management takes a long time to get medical benefits over a year and almost 2 yrs for spouse's and children and over 2 yrs for dental
Safeway,1d215m8prb81u800,2.0,The expectations are too high for the amount of time you have to complete tasks. I felt under appreciated. Healthcare and paid time off were main reasons for having worked there for almost a decade.
Safeway,1d21313fg52te800,5.0,best job ever fun managers are nice kind the atmosphere is good the customers are cool very fun interesting job pay is good and I am happy to work here
Safeway,1d20q8a18ak9i800,5.0,I loved working for them because they really had a great vibe and the service was good when I shopped as well. Plus the environment was lovable. Thank you.
Safeway,1d20pd5nrak9i801,5.0,"It was very important to the manager to stay focused on the job.  It was not a very busy store, but during the lunch rush many customers would come shop. When it was slow the assistant/manager would ask me to help out in other areas of the store."
Safeway,1d20n4mrlb81u800,4.0,I made a lot of good friends and acquaintances that I still know and speak to today. It was stressful but your day did go quickly. The deli was a fast paced area that not most can survive.
Safeway,1d20ab1v3ak5h800,1.0,"Terrible culture. Mgmt is abysmal, they are checking boxes and have no interest in supporting the pharmacists and pharm techs. All DMs care about is how many flu shots you give. 14 hour + shifts are not unusual (you don't get lunch and pharmacists don't overlap)  because you can't do it all in a 12 hour shift."
Safeway,1d206574vakha800,1.0,Constant pressured to do a three persons job. They were understaffed and were cutting staff hours. It would get so bad. We could only fill prescriptions as customers arrived. Back log got to a week behind. So much stress on the team there was no team.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d1v0t8djb89k800,4.0,"I would start my shift by rounding up all the carts and bringing them back into the store, then I would bag groceries, help customers to their car, open the liquor case, or walk the customers to a certain item in the store. I would then do the sweep log, where I walk around the store and clean up any messes that I come across and then log it on a paper every 30 minutes. When I closed I would have to collect all the garbage, help restock and, tidy up any isles that look messy."
Safeway,1d1ums187brdk800,3.0,"Safeway is a great company when it comes to the benefits they offer employees, but the lack of leadership and respect for the workers makes the work environment unhappy."
Safeway,1d1tqmk3q5ncj801,5.0,Safeway was a great company to work for. The only downside was I did not get enough hours. However the management was great and the coworkers we very friendly.
Safeway,1d1s3r4h4ak9b800,4.0,"Safeway was my first store management experience.  While training was adequate, there always seemed to be employee issues, add poor employee training meant high turnover, which made the experience a daily trial"
Safeway,1d1ron8oob81p800,4.0,Stocking shelves with bread
Safeway,1d1rh4hllb81p800,3.0,I was responsible for taking out groceries and taking carts back into the store in an orderly fashion. It was a fast paced job and sometimes stressful depending on the situation.  Cleaning up carts in the parking lot during the cold was my least favorite.  Some of the people I worked with were great.
Safeway,1d1rgdi4cb89k800,1.0,Worked there a long time ago and it was horrible. Bad management. Not enough employees scheduled. Dirty stores. Constant outages and unhappy people...
Safeway,1d1rficf2b89k800,1.0,"You get yelled at to work faster by Managers because they don't want to help check out the customers and don't end up hiring more employees even when the store is constantly struggling. You will end up having to do 3-4 jobs instead of just the one you signed up for all while being overworked. A family member could be dying and they will still yell at you and tell you that you need to come in anyways. Have paid sicks hours? Good luck trying to use them, they won't let you. Tell the Union? They do nothing but sit around and get paid more than you for it. Courtesy Clerks get the worst of it and get treated like garbage. I've had panic attacks because of how stressful it is to work there, and when I'd go to bed at night I'd have nightmares about that place. The work environment had caused me physical and mental pain. I spiraled back into depression and had to quit because I wanted to commit suicide from all the stress. The only good part was my coworkers and few regular customers. Otherwise most customers are stuck up and belittle you for not being rich like them. You might also get racist comments thrown at you for being anything but Caucasian. I tried to be or at least pretend to be happy working here but I could keep up the facade any longer."
Safeway,1d1rbq0qa5n97800,3.0,it was tuff because sleep all day because you work from midnight to the 8 am. but there is good in working at Safeway you get a 30mins to a 1 hr of brake with pay
Safeway,1d1qbt3gjakh4800,4.0,"Very stressful, after merger company expectected alot out of management and gave you less help. But ultimately I cant complain they provided for my family for a long time with excellent benefits at minimal cost at this day and age for me and my husband and our kids. The benefits  are still better than most places even better than city or county benefits. Ultimately you are still just a number to them though and are disposable which is sad."
Safeway,1d1q8ahr0b85o800,1.0,No set days off. Overly worked. I went from part time to full time without my knowledge. They cross train you because they lack employees. You don’t get breaks unless you beg for it. Your lunch is rushed because they usually need you back up front.
Safeway,1d1q4k9ujakh4800,3.0,Fast pace customer service then at closing and detailed sanitization operation. family type culture but leadership will not take responsibility for their failure and blame others for knowing what they were thinking and lack of proactiveness on management and schedule setting.
Safeway,1d1q3cudbb89k800,2.0,Management would expect extreme amounts of work with little to no appreciation for the work being done. The chances to advance in the company was very far and few between and if management knew you wanted to move up they were quick in making sure that they sucked every ounce of work from you.
Safeway,1d1phicp3b85o800,4.0,"Safeway/Albertson is a good place to work. The people are great, and that's probably the best part of working here after almost 6 years. I've developed from working here from a CSR1 to a CSR3."
Safeway,1d1pc5033brdk800,5.0,Great place to work! Everyone is like family there. Everyone works together with healthy competition. Hrs are fair as well as the pay. If you need family time off they understand.
Safeway,1d1mlit89b81m800,4.0,It is a consistently busy environment. From 7am-8pm there was a constant flow of customers then plenty of time before close to complete the cleaning and facing procedures before heading out for the night.
Safeway,1d1mbj0v5brdh800,3.0,"safeway was my first job out of pharmacy school. i had worked for safeway part time while going to pharmacy school, so was great they started opening pharmacies when i was finishing up. but they weren't progressive when needing to be. they were very late to the table getting computers, so i left."
Safeway,1d1k0th7jb89h800,5.0,"Lots of opportunity for career growth and movement. Very driven to improve the store cleanliness, convenience, safety and overall customer service experience."
Safeway,1d1k0os5qbrdh800,3.0,"I didn't mind my time at Safeway. I liked my coworkers, and my managers were nice for the most part. But good luck trying to get new hires. When our employee numbers went down in my department, I begged for them to hire new staff. The stores in the surrounding areas had 4 cake decorators in their bakery departments, while I was left on my own. This went on for several months. We had the occasional person swing by to help, but they never wanted to stick around. They always said it was too stressful. The ""Big Bosses"" came around quite frequently, and it was difficult to keep up with demands with no help, and without going into overtime. There's things you just aren't able to complete within an 8 hour shift and I wish more managers recognized that."
Safeway,1d1jqdoktb85l800,5.0,"Although it has been many years since I worked at Safeway, it was a positive energetic working environment with opportunity for advancement if interested."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d1jlnf0lbrdh800,3.0,"Had an opportunity to work in many different departments, from courtesy clerk to stocking for dairy, liquor, and general store. They even have a graveyard shift, for people who want to stock the shelves during closing time. All and all, a good place to work."
Safeway,1d1je0tsj5j52800,5.0,"Its was a great experience the manager was great to work for he cared about his people under him. Benefits was good not enough pay with the cost of living, but co workers where fun team players"
Safeway,1d1i0lskdb85l800,4.0,loved working there. Loved co workers. I loved cashiering and meeting all the people made new friends. I got a 10 on all my secret shoppers. I really am a team player. Have excellent customers service skills.
Safeway,1d1hb3c8qak96800,3.0,"Safeway is a great company for a first job. It pays, and they are pretty flexible with hours. However, I would not suggest making a career here. Their benefits are just not the greatest."
Safeway,1d1h9oq55b89h800,3.0,Union place. No chances for promotion unless you plan on spending 25 years doing night shift. promotions are based on seniority and not ability. good if you want to put in time and stay there. you will struggle for the first 10+ years. once you  move up on the seniority list you will be ok. Management will say one thing and do another. always get everything in writing and be clear and concise on everything you do because you will be called out on it.
Safeway,1d1h19du8brdh800,4.0,"Fast Paced Job and is overwhelming busy during the summer due to being the only Starbucks. Because being so far out in the middle of no where sometimes our shipment would be late and sometimes had issues with getting employees. Working for Safeway was good, I enjoyed my employees (that suck around) and getting to know my customers. People came from all over the world to see our beautiful town and sites around."
Safeway,1d1fmo02tbrdh800,3.0,"Overall a great job to have in college. Flexible, okay pay and some career advancement. A typical work day would can be pretty stressful and fast pace, but it would make the day go by quick."
Safeway,1d1fd4kqvb89h800,1.0,"Management is horrible. Promised hours but they lie. The department I worked for, the manager is sexist. He gives into men but makes the women work harder."
Safeway,1d1e5hnq0akd3800,3.0,"On a typical day, I would bag groceries for the customers, clean up the store by sanitizing the bathrooms, taking out the trash, etc, pull in carts, and other miscellaneous responsibilities. The workplace was chaotic and stressful, and the hardest part of the job was dealing with the people I worked with. However, the most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits I received."

Safeway,1d1cfq7s0akh1800,2.0,Under staffed with poor management.  I was part of the management team and was helpless to help employees / customers at times from lack of staffing.  They need to work on what customer service really is.
Safeway,1d1cdkfcgb85l800,5.0,"I started work at 2:30 am sometimes bad weather with snow and ice on the roads. I was done by 6:00 before the store was open. I would sometimes open the service deli and work remaining hours with them. I have stocked shelves, load the liquor cooler. Cut deli meats and mix salads. Set up the cooler and sometimes close the service deli for the evening."
Safeway,1d1cbv02vb89h800,4.0,"Safeway was a very fast paced work environment, if you can't be on your feet for long periods of time, this is not for you. Being a courtesy clerk was very easy. It is very hard to move up to be a checker though, but there is a seniority list."
Safeway,1d1bv969sb89h800,5.0,Excellent company to work for and they treat employees well.
Safeway,1d1b7p5sjb89h800,5.0,"Vons is very quick paced as it’s a grocery store. At least the department I worked in we had to be on top of the vegetables, fruits, etc. other than customer service we had to get skills in the department itself as you get customers asking questions regarding certain fruits or vegetables"
Safeway,1d1ag7opmb89g800,3.0,Its a good place to work if you are going to school because the hours are flexible. Besides that there are not a lot of benefits to the job. Yes you get insurance and time off for part time but you are union so you have to pay union dues for a job you are only making minimum wage and working only 20-30 hours a week. Depending on you situation it could be a good job but for the most part it is not a great place to work.
Safeway,1d1a9r56tb81l801,3.0,The day starts as soon as one clocks in & walks in the room in -while working issues to best resolve customer issues.
Safeway,1d1a86690b85k800,3.0,I loved working for safeway but it was management whom I had problems with. They made me feel uncomfortable about talking with them about my schedule. I felt I was being picked on when I injured my wrist at work. The customers were great I was with the company for 11 years and never had any problems until my last year.
Safeway,1d1a1a1ndbrdg800,2.0,"In the first year of being at the store the company went through 3 managers that all wanted to try different things. So every single time a new manager started, everything changed. The only reason why I stayed there for so long was because of my coworkers. But most of memories of working there are filled with the manager and the assistant manager and how poor they were at trying to make keeping the store at its peak a team effort. Wouldn’t recommend to even my worst enemy."
Safeway,1d18q6614as16800,3.0,Safeway is a franchise grocery store. Less communication with management. Providing service for customers purchasing different kinds of groceries for their home.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d187ina6b81l800,2.0,I had zero problems with my manager in my specific department but the work load that they expect you to do in such a short amount of time is REDICULOUS!! There was absolutely no way that your able to get all of what they needed you to get done in such a little time.
Safeway,1d17i0dklb89b800,1.0,wouldn't let me transfer to a store closer to home had no choice to quit no set schedule was always late to second job all around poor company to work for.

Safeway,1d14n6ug3brdb800,3.0,A great place to learn a trade.  They work students around their school schedules.  They encourage the young people to get an education.  A good place to gain work experience
Safeway,1d144vsdgbrdb800,1.0,"Worst job I ever had, management treats employees very poorly. No opportunity for advancement or better pay every one stars at minimum wage regardless of experience."
Safeway,1d125kf21b81f800,5.0,good employee sorrounding . learn bow to measure the correct ingrientiens . neat and clean premises. team leaders show effort within working hrs and off work.
Safeway,1d0vrgmthb85f800,3.0,"The management at safeway was very poor. She would rarely speak to me, and there was no way she would get me a manager position. I never was offered a pay raise. she also cut my hours and the reason was that she over hired and that she had to cut everyones hours."
Safeway,1d0vjn7715j4s800,3.0,Job is great for beginners. I enjoyed having flexible hours for I could work any shift available. Very straightforward and fun atmosphere. Could use a vending machine in employee rest room.
Safeway,1d0uum1ihbrdb800,4.0,Good company to work for. enjoyed working in the grocery business. You first start as a courtesy clerk and easily get promoted depending on you work ethic. Company doesn't pay as much as back in 05.
Safeway,1d0ump47kb81f800,5.0,This job was very fast paced and customer oriented. I enjoyed the time I have spent here and everyone there is so friendly. It really does keep you on your feet for long amounts of time which is okay because you don't really even think about it because you are so busy working.
Safeway,1d0u35fpibrdb800,2.0,Its a union based company. I worked as a cashier for the Safeway Fuel station.
Safeway,1d0tlfvdgb89b800,3.0,"My work days are either slow or fast paced. I learned to deal with extremely difficult situations, and a small workforce for in a busy environment. The hardest part of my job was when coworkers went for each others throats and made it extremely hard to work as a team."
Safeway,1d0t50bj4ak90800,4.0,"A typical day at work involved bagging customer groceries, checking orders, providing customer service, selling lotto tickets, stamps, money orders, and completing western union purchases and payouts. The workers are great and the company is more than willing to work with your schedule."
Safeway,1d0suic5ebrdb800,2.0,Not a good place to work. The management was not nice to there employees. I always felt I was not part of the team. The pay was not good and I could not afford to pay my bills.
Safeway,1d0sgvlb2brdb800,4.0,"Overall I enjoyed my employment with Safeway.  Unfortunately, because of the difficulty in filling overnight shifts, many weeks I was receiving full time hours.  I initially signed up for 3 nights a week because of my other full-time employment.  The approximately 70-75 hours per week of work combining the 2 jobs became too burdensome."
Safeway,1d0sgqh2eb85f800,2.0,none available. I do not want to write a review other than my coworkers are wonderful people and I miss working with all of them. That is the most enjoyable part of the job.
Safeway,1d0sep3s1b85f800,2.0,"It's grocery.. work hard, make a barely livable wage and get micromanaged on the daily. Might work for a temporary job, but not for a long term solution. Most customers are nice and understanding, however occasionally you will run into the less understanding types."
Safeway,1d0s0vrck5n8u800,3.0,"getting to the store, checking to make sure the drivers are ready to start their routes. New management for the area not up to par with the operation of the .com area. getting the stores to have the orders ready for the drivers. meeting new people."
Safeway,1d0qblifkak51800,4.0,There were good and bad things about working for Safeway. It was a union job so a lot of the problems we had were mainly the union and not Safeway itself. It was a great first time job for anyone. Management wasn't very helpful in situations about disagreements. There was a lot of favoritism. The workplace culture was very diverse. The hardest part of the job was the fact that we were always so busy and under staffed that we never got our full breaks or breaks at all. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendly staff and great customers.
Safeway,1d0q72560b85f800,2.0,"Good place to work in terms of money, holiday pay, etc. but the rotation of employees and management could determine a good day or a bad day. Our store manager was very difficult to communicate with and in my year of employment, and being my first job, there was never a time that the manager took the time to address me by my name. I felt small when I should have been beyond proud of myself."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d0pqaa07b81f800,5.0,This job was an excellent one to learn a lot about customer service. This was a fast-paced job and I loved it! The employees there were always nice and ready to jump in and help!
Safeway,1d0ppbgm6b81f800,2.0,I don't recommend working at Safeway at least in the Deli I constantly saw people treating poorly talked down to as well as gossip I even brought it to the directors attention and it was never addressed
Safeway,1d0o5reqg1d1f000,3.0,Was one place I worked but really didn't mind for it. Work days were eventful and long.

Safeway,1d0nkqpb11d0v000,1.0,Very low paying job at minimum wage and takes years to get a wage increase. Never get full time hours. Very high paced and stressful work. Management does not care about employees.
Safeway,1d0njggh41fdv000,3.0,"I would have probably stayed with this company however, back in the early 90s they company decided to cut pay and being a manager was difficult due to all the disgruntled employees."
Safeway,1d0ngbrla1d1f000,1.0,"Safeway does have many great people that work there and many great employees, but the management is not consistent and neither is any of the employees schedules or hours."

Safeway,1d0lokrh61d0v000,5.0,"I enjoyed working for Safeway, The store director and most of the workers are very loyal and kind.    There very nice when it comes to days where your not available       Its fairly easy to get promoted and get raises"
Safeway,1d0lfp2ne1d1f000,4.0,This is a good first job it teaches you professionalism and work flow. There is alot to do but it keeps you on you toes and busy. They are a competitor so there is alot of checks from upper management but it isn't to stressful. Overall good place.
Safeway,1d0kngb9mb80h800,4.0,"I enjoyed my role at Safeway, the only reason I left was because the company moved offices giving me a 62 mile each way commute.  Annual reviews with increases based on performance."
Safeway,1d0j5m3udb80h800,3.0,I took a pay cut. Because the company I worked for filed bankruptcy. They only gave me a quarter raise. I got a A  plus review!!I only received a 25 cent raise.
Safeway,1d0j2duhe1d0v000,3.0,"average first time job for teens. a bit stressful. management is ok, not much training. I don't enjoy working here, but that's just my opinion. a bit mind numbing - not much critical thinking."

Safeway,1d0i4vbv31d0v000,4.0,"Being able to work hard and still able to have fun with co-workers, at least at my store. There is always something to do and most will teach you anything you want to learn to do."
Safeway,1d0gthk6b1d0v000,4.0,Work hard and you will prevail. Work slow and uneducated then stay exactly where you are for years. Find the environment you like in the store and thrive at that portion.
Safeway,1d0g7ihjf1fdv000,3.0,"For the pay and experience gained, it's worth working here. Safeway is affiliated with the union, so you get 2 breaks and a minimum 30-minute lunch every day, as well as benefits after working there long enough. There's opportunity to transfer departments, and the store is fast-paced and competitive, so it's a great place to learn and grow if you're new to food handling and looking for a place to build your resume and range of skills."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1d0g2s4k91fdv000,4.0,Working at Safeway was usually an easy going day more than not it was so quick paced becuase of the low amount of staff during the time I worked there.
Safeway,1d0e5uhfd1fdv000,3.0,Typical work was a steady pace and good people work there. I learned of to make coffee. Management was poor at my location. A lot of zero communication and poor scheduling. I enjoyed my working with my coworkers and my regular customers.
Safeway,1d0e5ejrj1d0v000,4.0,Plenty of customer experience and entry level work to keep you busy while not being overwhelming. You get the occasional annoying or intolerable customer but they are just people you have to deal with.
Safeway,1d0dntg5e1bgf000,4.0,"Fast paced , busy ,  holidays are chaos, large staffed , corporate, and union business , paid fairly , great hours, great customer satisfaction,  great staff treatment , raise opportunities,  advancement opportunities."
Safeway,1d0dldcg41d1f000,2.0,"My department manager was not trained in management and crossed boundaries all the time.  It made work difficult, but overall Vons is an OK place to work."
Safeway,1d0djqal61bad000,4.0,Safeway extern for a few months. Great learning opportunity. The manager at Safeway pharmacy was amazing & really helped me out. Wonderful employees & not too high stress.
Safeway,1d0dh2nec1fdv000,2.0,"The employees are unionized at Safeway which leads to good long term benefits. However, most benefits don't start until at least six months in, so it is in the company's benefit to go through employees quickly. To do that, they actively shirk rules and laws designed to help employees, have no positive community building, poor starting wage, no casual benefits (like fun breakroom, activities, etc.). I left because the store failed to follow the new Fair Work Week law in Oregon."
Safeway,1d0d75d8v1d1f000,3.0,"A typical day is you show up to work do your best and get complained at for things you could not do. What did i learn lots of things customer service, handling money, physical endurance and how to learn with little to no training. Management was decent as long as you stayed on their good side. The culture was disappointing. the hardest part of the job was dealing with employees who did not want to work."
Safeway,1d0ctmldrb80h800,3.0,"Was fired because I could not pay the union dues when I was barely getting by as a college student as it was. However, the produce manager was very nice and understanding with my school schedule/."
Safeway,1d0ckpd5b1fdv000,5.0,Made sandwiches and filled orders for customers. Prepped food for service. Maintained strict cleanliness standards in the kitchen. Kept shelves and displays stocked.
Safeway,1d0bm03fr1d1f000,2.0,I worked with alot of nice people who enjoyed there job and where they lived.i would stock shelves and face isles i worked night full time
Safeway,1d0bivelub80h800,5.0,"i really enjoyed working at the deli where i was able to learn alot from along with my coworkers, we were such a great time to have everything done by the time it needed to be done"
Safeway,1d0bf30lj1fdv000,5.0,"Great starting pay and and overtime hours available. Job stability is guaranteed, just plan on lots of overtime. 12 -14 hours a day 5-6 days a week. Awesome benefits and employees are treated with respect."
Safeway,1d0am84jh1fdv000,3.0,I worked at Safeway for almost 2 years and it was a fair job to work for until they switched out a good manager and the employees begin to have me do their dirty work for them.
Safeway,1d0akplig1agu000,5.0,shedule is determined by seniority
Safeway,1d0aj98nv1d0v000,5.0,Safeway was an eye opening experience. I loved my job but did not receive enough hrs to survive. I would still be working for them if they had given me more hrs. I loved the people I worked with and my customers I miss terribly. It was an absolute joy to work for Safeway. I looked forward to going to work every day of the 10 years i was employed there.
Safeway,1d0ai77nn1fdv000,3.0,"This job is good if you work well customers. You will encounter different people in the store, either outgoing people or just people who aren't having a good day. This was my first job so I did not expect who I would run into and what I would do at work. There are also ""shops"" where there are undercover managers or bosses who test to see if you are doing well in your store so you must keep a customer-oriented bearing at all times."
Safeway,1d0afluu41ahe000,1.0,I wouldn’t prefer anyone to work there it’s not worth the pay. I say that because they work you hard hours and you’re not receiving the pay you deserve it’s better finding something that’s going to benefit you in the long run.
Safeway,1d0aefts91d1f000,4.0,"I've worked both in the deli and the produce's fresh cuts department. I've avoided the cashiers and courtesy clerks jobs because I've heard terrible stories about them from coworkers. In the deli, it was fast paced and you felt like you never finished anything you set out to do, lots of waiting on customers. And you always smell like fried chicken. In Fresh Cuts, I became really close with the people I worked with every day. We only had two or three people in the department working and there is little to no customer service for that department. There is a lot of gossip and drama, as would come with any job, you just have to keep your nose out of it and it's actually a fun job."
Safeway,1d0aaig1p1bad000,3.0,This job is a good place for a high schooler just starting out and getting they're first job. They really try to work around your schedule or if your very limited to how much you can work.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.

Safeway,1d08nbt151fdv000,4.0,"Great place to work, with union benefits. My only issue with it was that the hours were extremely inconsistent and caused a strain with my personal life."
Safeway,1d08cecet1fdv000,1.0,My employer was not willing to be understanding and considerate that I had a disability. She was not supportive in keeping me employed at Safeway. I was given 2 days of training. It was not enough training. I felt that if I had been given more training and had support from my supervisor I would still be at this company.
Safeway,1d08aou171aie001,1.0,"Store Management at this particular store was woefully pathetic.  Frequently very unprofessional and unresponsive to customer or associate needs.  Problem solving was not their forte, and declining sales at this store was intricately linked to the incompetency of the store manager and lead assistant manager/person-in-charge.  I suppose it didn't help that they were secretly dating."
Safeway,1d081d9bj1fdv000,2.0,Typical Grocery work...deal with customers...stocking...cashier..bagging...maintaining store....keeping employees on point...typical grocery business with a union.
Safeway,1d07t88rk1fdv000,3.0,The team I worked with was very helpful. No matter how you were struggling they made sure they made you feel like you’re part of the team. They will guide you and assist you as much as you need until you are comfortable with your current job position.
Safeway,1d06bv4pb1d1f000,3.0,"It is an alright job if you want a pay check.  I never worked in a deli and I never want to do it again.  Most of the time you are alone helping customers.  Basically, you have to run the whole deli alone and does get stressful at times."
Safeway,1d05oiknv0kbv000,4.0,"only two people working overnight. was able to listen to music while i worked. didnt have to deal to much with other manager, employees or customers. ok place to work for."
Safeway,1d03t7m6k1fdv000,1.0,"I dont have nothing to say. I need more hours. I need more pay, I use to get way more hours.  I been there for four years and barely make over minimum wage. They show favoritism about who gets hours and who doesn't."
Safeway,1d03a97871agu000,1.0,"Terrible place to work, People are pushy with female coworkers, Management was horrible, I wouldn't even wish it on my worst enemies. Do not work here!"
Safeway,1d035ficu1d1f000,5.0,I am very saddened by the fact that I can no longer work for Safeway. I left my position for a better job and then my new job didn't work out and I moved. I tried to get rehired after my move but due to a previous background snafoo I was ineligible for rehire.
Safeway,1d033p5nl1bgf000,4.0,I worked my way up through different areas within Safeway. I was able to advance to higher paying positions as well as gain knowledge of different areas of Safeway.
Safeway,1d01o6p321d0v000,5.0,Fun workplace great place to work. Lots of new learning experience. Met new people every day. Learn new things everyday. Every on that you work with are supportive and caring.

Safeway,1cvuhe5rc1agu001,3.0,"A typical day at work is checking for carts, cleaning trash, and bagging groceries.  I learned how to clean.  The managers are demanding but fair.  Excellent people to talk with and talk to.  The hardest part of the job is tackling the challenges of the day.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the comraderie."
Safeway,1cvu9bjdvb80h800,3.0,"A typical work day at Safeway would consist of numerous tasks in the floral department, both labor intensive and creative. I really enjoyed the nature of my job yet working with the public was challenging. I really loved the store manager where I was at. She really cared and she worked hard with a smile on her face or a funny laugh she would often have. I learned that working for a large store like that wasn't the right place for me to be. The hardest part of my job was the overwhelming nature of peoples energy seeing that I am a highly sensitive person. It wasn't a good fit for the long run."
Safeway,1cvu0kkiv1bad000,5.0,"Management was amazing, not enough hours and the job was fairly easy customers are great, I enjoy working evenings, stocking shelf's, keeping the store clean"
Safeway,1cvrnm5kb1d0v000,3.0,"well wed show up clock in at the morning meeting and stretch to not get cramps and people would be drinking preworkout and just getting ready go grab our jacks and go to the printer where the head set that we had to wear would tell us what job we had to do. Then we would go to either produce, dairy, cheese or meat room and fill the order."
Safeway,1cvrkulhd1d0v000,5.0,Was a great place with to for. I was able to move up pretty quickly and thrived with the responsibility. If I had a chance to retake the same position I would. Very busy and face paced store in the downtown location.
Safeway,1cvrfeddb1d1f000,3.0,being a cashier at safeway is awesome really fast pace get to no a lot of people.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1cvrefnvb1fdv000,3.0,no room for advancement didn't get paid well for working before store even opened 3am every morning. store manager was mean and rude. bakery manager was mean and unorganized and lazy
Safeway,1cvr4j4kf0mtf000,3.0,"""Each to their own."" This was my sole takeaway after working for Safeway, Inc. My colleagues were more against each other than for each other, which was uncomfortable because I was neither for/against anyone. I just wanted to put in my hours to the best of my ability, and go home. I did not appreciate the workplace drama. It was highly unprofessional of my co-workers. I was promoted twice in the few months that I worked there, and my colleagues were not at all happy about that. It was pretty intense. I also worked the overnight/graveyard shift by myself, and the store did not have a security guard or any security equipment (e.g. anti-theft equipment), so that was pretty intense (and quite frankly, slightly terrifying) for me. I had to act as cashier, bagger, manager, and security all at once."
Safeway,1cvr2otpb1bgf000,3.0,"Overall, working at Safeway was a fast-paced and educational experience where I got to learn the importance of customer service in the retail industry and how attention to detail in your work can do wonders. The management, on the other hand, showed me how to avoid work and treat your employees with less than what is known as respect."
Safeway,1cvqpcbhr1fdv001,1.0,This is the worst job ever manager yells and screams at customers and demand you do work whenever she want you to. This job's OK for college student working their way through college the step to go to other jobs for some experience
Safeway,1cvpqmheu1fdv000,2.0,Safeway for a long time was a great place to work.  When they where sold there were major changes.  They hired 45 percent more people than needed to push down the amount of hours the journey men where getting.  People who had worked there 20 years full time started to get less than 30 hours a week.  I could not recommend Safeway as a good place to work and I spent 11 years there and left on my own accord.
Safeway,1cvp2r6h41fdv000,1.0,"They do not care about their employees at all. If you have children, don't even bother applying. They will make you choose between caring for your child or having a job."
Safeway,1cvp2ha5j1d1f000,2.0,"Crazy work environment. Very stressful, especially on holidays. Union company but the union is a mess and doesn't hold any power. Health benefits are imposed even if you don't want them."
Safeway,1cvp22lph5nch800,3.0,Loved working with my co-workers but management very toxic. They stress out the good employees but let the employees who never work and/or call out sick constantly get away with so much. The first few months of the job were nice. It was fairly simple and I was good at it.
Safeway,1cvovcrt51d0v000,3.0,the customers are friendly and  so is the staff. they make the 8 hours fly by and you just about forget that its time to clock out. enjoyable work space.
Safeway,1cvoim5hq0mcv000,2.0,They overhire early and weed everyone out by severely cutting hours until someone gives up and quits. Would not recommend. They said they would pair me with someone in the bakery at all times but instead I was alone with too much on my plate for one person.
Safeway,1cvnb4btu1fdv000,4.0,Worked on the night crew of the store (so almost no public interaction at all.)  They were all a bunch of good people
Safeway,1cvn4g1k41d1f000,3.0,I learned from my time in  Wenatchee Safeway  and my manager there was the greatest. Here in Spokane Safeway it was  a stressful situation and I was glad to quit.  Wished it had been better.
Safeway,1cvmq8b1e1fdv000,1.0,Loved working with my co-workers but management very toxic. They stress out the good employees but let the employees who never work and/or call out sick constantly get away with so much.
Safeway,1cvlr66nrb80h800,2.0,I would be assigned multiple tasks a day by the hour. I have learned how to work hard even when very tired and learned discipline and organization. The management was decent and did not really give time off. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and other peoples goals of how Safeway helps build a strong foundation.
Safeway,1cvktjj7m0mcv000,3.0,During my employment at Safeway i can truly say i enjoyed my time here. The mangers/supervisors and the coworkers were truly amazing.  Working here has taught me a lot about professionalism and handling different situations.
Safeway,1cvjvvdj61d0v000,4.0,When I worked in the Deli. It would go from slow to very quickly paced depending on the time of day.
Safeway,1cvedvgq31aie000,5.0,I was a bagger collecting cards doing a lot of things for Safeway and basically I would love to work on another Safeway out here in certain in Oakland if you're hiring me I will come to the job interview and I will not miss this one please let me work for you guys and I can show you what I can do.
Safeway,1cvd737e61d0v000,1.0,Everyone of these stores is extremely cliquish people will cut deals no matter what you do  you management has a habit of singling people out and making things as hard as they can for them and treats everyone like trash in general the courtesy clerk vests stink of sweat because they haven't been washed in who knows how long..wouldn't be working here if i didn't need the money..
Safeway,1cvclkfbb1fdv000,3.0,Working at SafeWay is fun but the pay is just not enough to live off of. The other staff is nice and I enjoyed working there. I enjoyed enteracting with the customers.
Safeway,1cvcl2sf50mtf000,5.0,i really enjoy my time at Safeway sometimes i wish i was still working there.t met alot of people working there and became friends with alot of people.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1cvbujna31fdv000,3.0,"As a checker at Safeway, most of the day would, of course, be spent checking, working with customers, etc, exactly what you'd expect.  However, the longer I stayed, the more noticeable the cracks and flaws in the system of management were.  Management barely ever communicated with the rest of the staff unless it was a matter of severity/punishment for poor quality, there was no system where we were able to speak to them about actual needs we had."
Safeway,1cvbtgopk1ahe000,5.0,"Projected in electronic maintenance repaired, learn about new technology events with guide and help of management, work place was related to more mentally than physical work. My hardest part of the job was diagnosing and finding the problem. I enjoyed my job every day of it, was a learning and educative experience."
Safeway,1cvav45do1fdv000,2.0,"Management had no communication. Seemed like no one knew what they're responsibilities were, so they always pushed work onto another co worker. When brought up to upper management they would do little to nothing to fix the situation."
Safeway,1cva16qip1agu000,2.0,"The first few months of the job were nice. It was fairly simple and I was good at it. They decided to cut my hours by more than half of what I was getting. I have bills I need to pay, and 10-15 hours won’t cut it."
Safeway,1cv9hf3p7b80h800,4.0,This was an environment that was great with customers and employees were friendly. I would recommend people there to do their daily shopping there everyday.
Safeway,1cv9h93hm1fdv000,5.0,"I Loved working at Safeway, it waa a fun job and there were cool people there. The environment was fast pace and the temperature felt amazing. I learned how to operate a pallet jack and how to build pallets up to seven feet high."
Safeway,1cv942ufo1d0v000,2.0,"I worked in the produce department at Safeway, although i would regularly assist other departments around the store. There was never any appreciation or respect from management to the employees. we were expected to do full time work while only having part time hours. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the customers."
Safeway,1cv89kv9j1ahe000,3.0,The bakery manager was very rude constantly writing me and only me notes on how I could improve wich were not fun. And whenever i wasdoing something she would tell me that its wrong and correct me rudely. I got no 15 minute break because i worked too slowly and manger got 10 15 minute breaks. Not to mention that the other bakery clerks would degrade me and if your not a smiker you dont get breaks
Safeway,1cv6nmg9r1bgf000,3.0,"I didn't hate working here but customers are the worst. It' also a place were employees are constantly coming and going, so the general feel is that no one really cares. Not to say that they were never nice people but even the upper management lacked any personal connection or the barest hint of caring about their employees, unless they were particularly kind people."
Safeway,1cv6geo501d0v000,3.0,"my typical day at work is like working at the register or self check out for 4-8 hours. I have learned how to count money fast and efficiently, check with little error. management changes too often to really know how it is."
Safeway,1cv4jc1bp1d0f000,1.0,"Store management is awful, they will yell at you even when you've done nothing wrong, constant threats to lose your job, threats of being written up, management will approve split shifts and then blame you and act like they never approved it. High school level drama and bullying, you get a 5% discount on everything, no PTO, no unpaid vacation time, unpredictable scheduling, no hours available but understaffed. I wish I could say something good about this position but there are none, I am the lowest paid person in the entire store yet the most micromanaged and in a specialty department that should be paid around $12/ hour."
Safeway,1cv4bselr1d1e000,3.0,"I rarely had the opportunity to work with a coherently focused team of individuals. As much as I asked despite the time I worked and tried to advance there, cross-training wasn't something they would offer because ""They did not have enough people trained well enough for me to leave""."
Safeway,1cv3rp6h81fdu000,3.0,"Was greeted by fellow co-workers and then was instructed on which daily tasks needed to be completed throughout the day. Before preparing produce, I made sure that everything around me was cleaned and organized to avoid any safety risks for co-workers and customers of the store. After making sure the area(s) were safe, I took the proper steps in order to prepare produce foods (e.g. parfaits, cut-fruit) to display them in the produce sections for purchase. Also, outside of preparing produce, I was able to help customers with any questions and needs, and made sure that the produce section was organized for a neat display to costumers. The hardest part about the job was clean-up at the end of the day, especially when we were under-staffed. Overall, my experience with Safeway allowed me to really work on my personable skills, as well as skills that revolved around time-management, and problem solving."
Safeway,1cv35ops71d1e000,5.0,"Days working at Safeway were very unpredictable. One minute your trying to find extra things to do because nobody's shopping. Than out of no where a storm of customers come flying threw and thats when it gets cracking. Zooming through customers to get them on there way was very exciting and it made the time go by a lot faster. I worked at a Safeway in Burns, Or a small little town where the only competition was small local grocery store."
Safeway,1cv2qa13s1d0f000,2.0,"I was there for almost 2 years. I started as a bagger, then was a checker, and was also a deli clerk. Pay is terrible I started at minimum wage and ended making 30 cents over minimum wage at the end. They’ll force you to work extra shifts during busy times of year and they don’t care if your a student or have family plans. Manament is lazy and what help anyone. You are forced to join a union that takes your money but doesn’t do anything to help you. If your trained as a checker your life will be even more busy because they never schedule enough help and you will called up to check all the time. Almost all the employees that have been there a long time in the store are very selfish and will never help. I think the only good Is normally the people who are your own age you normally become friends with and you get to complain about Safeway together"
Safeway,1cv2fdkf41fdu000,5.0,Safeway milk plant is a great place to work. There is always something new to learn and it keeps you one your toes. Safety is very important and comes first

Safeway,1cv1jn38n1agl000,4.0,"I enjoyed the work, fast paced.  I learned how to make salads, sandwiches, keeping the areas clean and neat.  I had a great manager to work with and who appreciated the work that was done."
Safeway,1cv17kbkg1fdl000,1.0,"Unhonest work environment. Promised raises and advancement only to be taken away for no apparent reason. Unreliable work hours. One week would have 40 hours, the next week would be 24 hours in order to keep me at part time so i could  not receive full time benefits."
Safeway,1cv1104nq1bg6000,5.0,Fun! Managers were great and co workers were alway pleasant to be around. The customer demand fit the amount of workers and there was rarely an issue in providing service.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1cv0utkm51d17000,3.0,"Being a worker who takes pride in his work, found it difficult to go above and beyond when the hire up managers don't take their job seriously. The store I worked at could have been at a much higher standard but Safeway refuses to take notice."
Safeway,1cv0lkcql1d06000,5.0,I actully really enjoyed working for safeway i left because i moved to a new state the people i worked with was very help full if i need more hours they would always try there best to give me more hours they worked around my schedule when needed
Safeway,1cuvddr0v1ah6000,4.0,"A nice job if you want an ""8 and skate"" career. Requires great people skills; if you don't have them, they'll teach you. Love working with such an interesting customer base!"
Safeway,1cuut8vfa1d06000,4.0,"Piece of cake. As long as you use common sense and a great attitude, it's a simple job. Customer relations, product knowledge, and efficiency make everything that much simpler."
Safeway,1cuuqjf2c1d17000,4.0,It’s a good place to go and start you work life to get the feelcor a place to go for momentary work while you figure out what you want to do or where you wanna go for work.

Safeway,1cusojrs01fdl000,4.0,Clock in and pull the product that's on pallets from the back of the store to the front of the store. then stock the shelves. Then face the store( make sure all labels are facing forward).
Safeway,1cus9fjqe1d0l000,3.0,"I worked there when I was 16. It is a simple grocery store, all tasks are pretty simple and low stress. The store carries a ""the customer is always right"" policy that was often abused."
Safeway,1cus8av1q1d0l000,2.0,"It's a nice place to work until you make one mistake. I made the mistake of calling out for the first time and I got put on a contract. Ever since then I've been treated poorly and I got suspended, which is bad, for being injured."
Safeway,1cupsj33c0kbn000,3.0,Everything pretty fair and the work environment it excellent with Teamwork. A typical day at work would usually go by slow but a lot could be done in the amount of time. The Mangers are great love to work with you as one.
Safeway,1cuo2c5851d0l000,5.0,It was a great place to work for. Sometimes the managers were lazy and put more on me than it should have been. I made sure that my job was always done.
Safeway,1cunlp5nn1ahl000,2.0,Employees were underpaid. Management too often preferred to hire from outside instead of promoting within. Management sometimes lacked professionalism and decorum in the workplace.
Safeway,1cunb8kq01ai6000,4.0,"Safeway treats their employees like family and will train every employee to be the best worker that they can be possible. The customer service within the company is magnificent as well.  After experiencing a clean and thorough establishment, each customer leaves Safeway with a satisfied smile on their face."
Safeway,1cun98s371d06000,3.0,Very busy place to work Have worked here over a year and  have not gotten a raise I have asked for one and still no reply. Management is very bad there’s not talk to you the only time I talk to you it’s to tell you that you’re doing a bad job or that you need to work faster.
Safeway,1cun0rsro1d17000,3.0,"As a Helper Clerk, I get pulled into various positions throughout the store. Primarily, I am scheduled as a courtesy clerk. I am paid minimum wage, and get very few hours. Weekly paychecks are nice to see, but the hours employees are provided is poor, with our company earnings not making up for expenses, and cuts being made constantly."
Safeway,1cul5svj80kbn000,3.0,Quick paced work conditions that will always keep you busy. Everything is mostly good but they will not get rid of troubled employees because the process takes too long.
Safeway,1cul0ch981ai6000,3.0,"typical grocery store job, not happy about the tier system they have for raises. Love all my coworkers, just how corporate policies work, there is nothing anybody can do about it."
Safeway,1cuks68kd1agl000,2.0,Its a good job if you need a job. Although it is good to be aware that there are not many opportunities for advancement or raises. Management is poor and often changes.
Safeway,1cukia7vd1ahl000,2.0,"If you’re interested in becoming a closing manager and you have a family, just know that you’ll be there til midnight EVERYNIGHT and won’t have a life.

Safeway,1cuk7mc3m1ai6000,1.0,"Management was not consistent. They ensured that personnel did not make the full time status, to not require giving the full benefits.  Union issue caused me to be paid less than others that came in after, though I was doing more work."
Safeway,1cujedloj1d17000,1.0,"Don't expect to anything more than working at safeway, from working at safeway. It won't get you anywhere except further down a rabbit hole. Not a viable place to work and support a family."
Safeway,1cuir3rlb1d14000,3.0,Safeway is an okay company to work for. Benefit for managerial personnel is so so. There is little work and life balance. Most employees feel stress with work.

Safeway,1cugbq20b1fdi000,1.0,"this is an okay job, best for people right out of high school to have an easy job while making decent money working. this could potentially get you through school if you play your cards right. This company has no reason to keep long term employees because they just dont care how great you are. but make fat money until u get a better job and dumb them like a high school date."

Safeway,1cts9qdlhbrft800,1.0,"I was harassed many times by older men and nothing was done about it by security who just watched. Coworkers had bad attitudes and thought they were above you (aka the checkers). I’d be in the parking lot until midnight collecting carts, cleaning a drug-abused bathroom, and cleaning up messes that managers should have stepped in to help with. Also, most recent manager is extremely disrespectful. Overall an unsafe, unhealthy, and poorly managed store. Would never recommend working here, especially to teenage girls."
Safeway,1cts4ts021d0s000,4.0,Being a grocery home shopper was one of the neatest jobs I've ever had. I started around 5am and worked usually at least 8 hours.

This a very labor intensive job you need to be strong and healthy and able to lift and carry heavy loads. be ready to work hard and over your scheduled hours if needed until the job is done. Be prepaired for extra hours hours during the holidays due to extreme amount of business.

Safeway,1ctlrkn3d1d0e001,5.0,It was a very fast paced place to work. It was always busy. That was most likely because it was right off a freeway. It was a small town full of nice regulars .
Safeway,1ctlgpqca1d0r000,5.0,"Very good company to work for . Great staff , great customers. Upbeat and fast work place environment. Happy faces. Vacation time,sick pay. Willing to work with your life schedule ."
Safeway,1ctkat5msaqj6800,4.0,"It was an ok place to work. When I started there, my coworkers warned me that it was terrible, but it wasn't that bad. I made several valuable connections with management who were eager to help me progress in my Safeway career."
Safeway,1ctjnloo21d0r000,5.0,its like a second family. If you can hang in there it gets better every time. but you will be on your feet all day and that can be painful. Over all its a good job. Its frustrating waiting for your raises because everyone is on a contract. the bakers union has great dental and vision benefits. Most people don't know the bakery is a different union from the rest of the store. But I hate that they make the bakers wear white now. Its so hard to keep clean and not dingy looking no matter how much you wash them
Safeway,1ctjmipqdas3a800,1.0,In our area we've had employees attempt or commit suicide due to the poor treatment from their managers. Other employees have been denied leave even diagnosed with cancer or other medical emergencies regarding their health or even their own children. No one should have be sick and worried when their life is going to end because a Job that allows leave doesn't want to grant it so the individual could receive treatment in a timely manner.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1ct683tn1b8bl800,4.0,"I started out working the coffee bar and quickly was moved to the deli, where I became the first female Chinese food cook. I then advanced to the pharmacy which I loved"

Safeway,1ct60pha7b8bl800,3.0,Upon starting there was a great place to work but our store manager left and a new one was hired. at this point is when the moral of the store started to fail
Safeway,1ct4q4etc5nbo800,4.0,"Management is poor, but other than that it is a fun place to work at, great co- workers, great customers, etc..............................................."
Safeway,1ct3nbfacb8bl800,5.0,I worked costumer service my first year. Then cashier. Then deliveries for pharmacy.
Safeway,1ct2c4p5cb8bl800,3.0,"It was my first job, that allowed me to work through high school as well as through some college. they were very flexible with my hours, and gave me the opportunity to move to different positions around the store."

Safeway,1csrh0g68as34800,5.0,Working in the pharmacy at Safeway taught me many new things about medicine and insurance couples. The management was not the greatest and we were often understaffed.
Safeway,1csreuihf5j7b800,4.0,This is the first job were everybody helped out it just made the days go by faster. And by far the best management I have worked for so far out of all my jobs
Safeway,1csovv5t45nfi800,4.0,At Safeway i beleive that the company suffers from a lack of leadership and a disconnect from its evey day employees due to lack of communication i like it because there is a measurable amount of work that needs to be ✔
Safeway,1csovcl97akbd800,4.0,"In my short time employed at Safeway I was given a two dollar an hour performance based raise, and offered a management position. The managers and corporate both took the time to assess, promote, advance and reward there best employees."
Safeway,1csoqqv9rakik800,4.0,Working at safeway was great I was the store bookkeeper so I worked alone until my work was done and I had to stay to assist the cashiers.I also lived about 25 mins away and had another job so that really is the only reason I resigned.
Safeway,1csnn8p9gb83u800,4.0,"Store always has Active , that don't seem like a good sign to me , like my previous job at burger king , so many quit cause of poor work environment , but Safeway isn't really poor , needs a quite bit of work"
Safeway,1csnf88fpb83u800,5.0,"Everyday working there was worth ever minute, Supervisors were easy going , they always made sure that employees were taken care of,  and always had Satisfied customers everyday."

Safeway,1csn7k8tsb87q800,1.0,"Worst job I've ever had. Never hated going to work as much as I did well working here. Awful management although as long as you don't show up drunk, or steal from the company you for the most part have job security."
Safeway,1csmiepflb8bf800,2.0,"This was a J.O.B. for me- didn't find the fulfillment I was looking for. But to be fair, the company was going through a major restructure at the time I worked for them. I have a family member working for them now, and things seemed to have stabilized quite a bit."
Safeway,1csmghgc5aqir800,3.0,if this is you're first time in the grocery industry then prepare for a fast paced environment do not work hear if you canot take alot of criticism and prepare to work for free
Safeway,1csl6al1ub8bf800,3.0,"The work is what you expect to do in a grocery store. You help people find items, stock, and organize items. The best thing about working here is you get to eat food."
Safeway,1csko94pcakem800,4.0,A typical work at Safeway will have its up's and downs you will never know what your day is going to be like until you clock in and work a whole shift.

Safeway,1cskl7jdhb83u800,1.0,"At Safeway (and I use ""safe"" loosely), I was thrown into the most stressful environment of my working career. While the law says you have the right to choose whether you work overtime or not, you aren't given much of a choice, you will either be guilt-tripped into staying with the classic; ""Well that wouldn't be doing ME any favors..."" line, or they will keep giving you more stuff to do so you don't have time to look at a clock. The managers are greedy snakes who will purposely leave Night Crew, or the Courtesy Clerks understaffed to boost their bonuses (so I'm told/rumors swirl)."
Safeway,1cshqh2hjb87q800,5.0,"Fast pace environment with a lot of movement going on, customer service is very important as well as the dress code.  Early morning start, home by night time to spend with your family."
Safeway,1csfiis55b87q800,2.0,my typical day at safeway was stressful sometimes when i would have to go outside and get carts off the lot in freezing hot or even rainy temperatures but when i was working inside it was pretty calm when i wasn't having a panic attack every now and then. i learned how to bag stock shelves work in produce or dairy putting items away or on the shelf and how to tag discount items. the mananagment was pretty okay but there where times when the employees where not okay with a few particular people including trans  . the workplace culture was alright it was pretty busy a lot of times. the hardest part was having to go outside most of the day and gather carts as well as trying to manage my anxiety. the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work in the back of the store where there was not a lot of people around
Safeway,1csf3bif6b8bf800,5.0,A typical day inside of work at a Safeway is filled with drama. There's no better way to put it. I have learned how to manage my employees and seek out there differences in how they work and retain information to manage them fairly within reason. Trying to keep my employees happy as well as the customers can be a challenge at times but I feel like it just takes time. The hardest part of my job would have to be not becoming to invested in the whatever situation is when it doesn't feel the same back... But at the end of the day I enjoy most of my co workers and a lot of the regulars that come in daily! It makes it a little easier to make it through the day.
Safeway,1csemn6irb8bf800,5.0,Wonderful Management team
Safeway,1csd3ku9lb8bf800,3.0,"There a lot of positive people at this company ,but they are a few that make it impossible for you to grow and value you only if you are a brown nose I'm not a brown nose I speak the truth and some people can handle the truth I do miss working with that company but dont miss the store managers always belittle the employees and not showing a  lead by example."
Safeway,1cscog12i52vk800,5.0,Co-workers were great. I was able to learn new skills. Did training at another larger store. Flexible hours. The store I worked at was very small I wished I could have been in a larger store.
Safeway,1cscctb4iak7k800,1.0,"This is the worst place of employement in my career. Management is all men and treat women differently. If you don't conform to their un-ehticial ways, they will find a reason to fire you."
Safeway,1csaua1ot5nbf800,2.0,I worked there for a year and it was fun at first...then tables turned when management changed over. Everyone was getting on each other nerves and friends that turn enemies. It not fun at all.
Safeway,1csafdnofb83m800,4.0,The job by itself was alright but the management wasn't that great due to always having issues and not a solid manager. Or regular store management would have conflicts with employees months after they've been hired.
Safeway,1csa3p0kfbrf8800,5.0,"I was able to learn a lot while working at Safeway, I was told to complete various tasks and when it was slow I would ask if there's anything that I can do to spend my time to keep me busy. The managers and co workers I worked with are friendly and patient with me and if I wasn't sure how to do something they would always be around to help me complete my tasks. I learned how to bag groceries, talk to customers, complete various cleaning tasks and also complete grocery carry outs for customers. One of the great things about working at Safeway was when I was called at the customer service desk to help a blind lady shop and then escort her to the deli for her ride to come get her. A typical day at work for me consists of managing the recycling room, pushing carts and bringing them into the store, doing carry outs for customers, cleaning, taking cardboard and hand counts to the back and bagging groceries."
Safeway,1cs9sbld8akih802,2.0,"If you have autism spectrum disorder, this job may find this job stressful if more ways than others expect. If you have trouble socializing with people, they will not bother to try socializing with you. Since this is a job where you will be working with others, you may notice little groups or ""factions"" of employees who stick together as friends. If you have autism spectrum disorder, you mat not be a part of any of that; this may turn out to be a stressful, isolating and depressing work experience for you."
Safeway,1cs9rhbjfb83m800,5.0,"job is not quite hard just alot of rembering codes and tabeling things correctly, often time flys working behind the counter. customer service is everything, customer is always right"
Safeway,1cs94bkrqb87i800,3.0,"You can do better, even for this area. Same starting supervisor pay for 5 years. Not adjusting to the cost of living in the area. Always hiring...not a good sign."
Safeway,1cs8293v9aqio800,3.0,Safeway is a good job with good employees  some benefits and I would consider going back. They are flexible with hours and will fit your schedule to your lifestyle
Safeway,1cs7aoodhbrf8800,2.0,Meh. Benefits were not really there. The union was required and in highschool i really didnt need that. Plus the union provided well... nothing until just recently. Although the union probabl;y was able to leverage power as Safeway was losing money and power.
Safeway,1cs799qkub83m800,3.0,It was hard to make decisions when you are bound by a corporation located in another state to give input on an area they didn't know much about. You were left waiting for answers on decisions that should be a quick turn around time on.
Safeway,1cs782e0jb83m800,1.0,"Safeway only offer you 14 hour a week. You cook,clean,customer service, dishwasher,pot and pans,ovens"

Safeway,1cs75bjqbb87i800,5.0,I loved working in such a fast-paced work environment. There was never a dull moment at Safeway. The best part by far is working with the customers.

Safeway,1cs4n0itrb83i800,2.0,This is an honest review of my time at Safeway in the Lakewood Town-Center; there was seriously lack of training upon getting hired. I basically followed someone around for a few hours and watched some company policy videos online and that was all. I did not feel properly prepared for what I needed to know as a Courtesy Clerk.
Safeway,1cs4847t4b87f800,2.0,"Working at Safeway is ok, I enjoy my job and my immediate supervisor, and everyone in my department are good to get along with. career advancement or position advancement sucks, and there really is no diversity among the people at Safeway."
Safeway,1cs3ikidmb83i800,2.0,You get a 15 minute break. If you are a second or a minute late they call your full name over the PA system. Management could use some courses in compassion.
Safeway,1cs38sof6as2m800,1.0,Manager who was a woman continued to sexually harass me and offered me marijuana. My work was made very uncomfortable due to her. I did enjoy working with customers though and most of my coworkers were helpful when I started.
Safeway,1cs2c8lvq5j70800,4.0,Basically ya come in and do your job. Keep your work area clean. Work as much backstock as possible. Help out where you can when you can. Coworkers are hit or mis. Benefits are great.

Safeway,1crt383b7b83i800,3.0,I felt unsafe at Safeway since there's no security due to employees being suggested to not engage or try to stop people stealing from the store. Also management didn't know how to take care of the deli.

Safeway,1crqji4j3akie800,4.0,"As my first real job, I learned a lot! The company takes good care of their employees.

Safeway,1cro29n2fakib800,2.0,It was a company that was out of touch with its employees and the market it was in. It was behind the curve in its ability to adapt to the changing economy.
Safeway,1crnvg5a6brf2800,5.0,"I honestly hate that I didn't do my research properly. I loved my career at Safeway but when my brother was in an accident I had to move to the state he was in.

Safeway,1crnbudj3b8b3800,3.0,"There was no extra help when you truly needed it when opening and closing. No raises or advancement based on a person's job performance, it all came down to the Union and Contracts. Too many duties fell on just 1 person and no help or extra time to get things done (Placing Daily Department Orders, Deli Trays, Grab & Go Sandwiches and Salads, etc), lack of support from Upper Management."
Safeway,1crmqt76gb87b800,3.0,"As far as the working environment it was comfortable but when it came down to it I was underpaid and taken advantage of. After taking there failing seafood department and bringing it to be the top ranked seafood department in northern california for both sales and customer surveys, i was only rewarded with no raise, being told seafood department managers do not receive bonuses anymore and finally having my total labor hours cut meaning i would have to work twice as hard than previously even i had drastically improved sales and food waste numbers."

There are some really good PICs at my Safeway, they heed problems nicely and do their best to work them out. Most people are easy enough to get along with, I have had some disagreements with some of my co-workers, but have tried my best to just let it go. The hardest part of the job is  sometimes I feel like I can't control certain circumstances and it frustrates to deal with them, then I stress because I am late to finish my duties because of an inconvenience."

Safeway,1cr5sbpi0b8aq800,3.0,"I started working for Safeway at 1988. I left and came back because of the benefits.  I love the people I work with . My Manager Is wonderful .The grocery industry is a hard labor and hard hours for a family .NO set hours No set days . Even if you have to request days off your risking your job. after all the years I have been working for them , I still do not have set days off .  I can close tonight and be on the schedule for opening and I will not see my family for days."
Safeway,1cr5855ut5neu800,5.0,Come in and just get started. Work your loads and keep back stock neat and rotated. I learned to stay busy and on top of things so that i don't get set back or behind on anything. Management was pretty good. They could always answer questions or find out answers when needed. Hardest part was keeping up on displays and expiration dates mostly because i was working alone in a pretty large department. Mostly enjoyed everything from coworkers to customers to doing my job. It wasn't hard to catch on to but it just got boring being by myself in the department.
Safeway,1cr4a7gdgbrep800,4.0,A typical day at work varies between each department. I have learned to speak up when needed. The management is pretty good. The hardest part of the job is getting bad customers.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1cr2p0ebkaqia800,4.0,Still enjoy coming to work after 12 years of service
Safeway,1cr1iu3peb832800,3.0,"Safeway is a pretty decent job.  It offers good benefits such as vacation, paid holidays and good insurance.  They do promote from within so there is opportunity to work your way up."
Safeway,1cr14df0gake2800,3.0,Job has opportunity to move up in management also have opportunity to move up in pay and offers good health benefits and also gives you sick leave and helps employees out when it comes to doctors appointments
Safeway,1cr13s5poakam800,4.0,"I was required to pull a certain number of orders per day.  This kept me engaged in the position.   There was repetitive heavy lifting.  There were good opportunities for pay raises.  However,  it was somewhat dangerous."
Safeway,1cr0kl0un5neo800,5.0,"Very positive and respectful people and learned a lot, very challenging but fun, good Management good culture and not wiling to work no where else but here"
Safeway,1cqunqulub8an800,2.0,"I was not fond of working at Safeway at all! The employees were rude and disrespectful. They don't care about anyone. Even in the summer, the store was dim and depressing."
Safeway,1cquhf6v9b86v800,3.0,"Merger with Albertsons' turned a profitable company to a loss company.  A big part of this downturn was venture capital debt, but there are also operational issues."
Safeway,1cqufgfh4brem800,2.0,"Safeway's customer service program sucked.  To customers, it was obvious that the customer service program was forced upon the employees.  The pleasantries were obviously fake and not from the employee's heart; just a part of your job.  In addition, your continued employment was determined upon one's customer service scores."
Safeway,1cquadnugb8an800,4.0,"Worked as a teamster and machinist. teamster jobs were paid well and great benefits. Machinist jobs paid lower than industry locale, pension failing, and safeway does not value truck/trailer mechanics as they are a grocery store not trucking industry. Management constantly changes as well as rules and guidelines. Lack of overall structure."
Safeway,1cqsjbq4ub832800,1.0,You have to work 16 hours minimum which was a lot for me. Pay is minimum wage and you have to join a union to be able to work there. I was a courtesy clerk so I did sweeps and carts and bagging. Maybe if I was a cashier it would be more fun. The manager and assistant manager never coordinated so they had you do different things and the other got mad at you for not doing something else. Supervisors were nice and so were others.
Safeway,1cqrrm4cvbrem800,1.0,"I did not enjoy my time at safeway. it was low pay, not enough hours,heavy work load. i did however, like my coworkers. i also learned alot about baking, preparing, and customer service."
Safeway,1cqrn6kmjb832800,3.0,"My experience of working for Safeway was actually through a temporary agency.  I was placed in the corporate offices as a data entry clerk.  However, I have been a longtime fan and shopper of Safeway-- ever since I was a young adult, and from childhood with my own family.  No problems on that end. Nevertheless, I think that the work culture in the office setting can be monotonous, and dealing with out of state clients/vendors (Mostly from California and the Pacific Northwest) creates a difficult work standard, that usually doesn't exist with local entities (save for a few).  The corporate offices deals with procurement from the airport; and having been a previous airline worker-- I found the inconsistencies to be quite appalling.  The continuous tardiness of products, the quality of products, the price ($$$) of the products and the apparent lack of concern from management can create a snowball of lethargic attitudes in all areas of the warehouse.  I am someone that has had consistent 5 star hospitality and tourism training, and I feel that Safeway Inc. pales in comparison to the movement of high performing culture in the workplace.  This makes customers dissatisfied and workers on the receiving end of a massive “cover up” of their basic operations."
Safeway,1cqrh7b8vbrem800,4.0,"being a large chain they are able to pay better and are more professional than grocery outlet. I worked grave yard, but was unable to adjust to that life schedule."
Safeway,1cqr67ioob8an800,4.0,This was my first job. I enjoyed my time at Safeway. If you are out of high school going into college or in high school right now and need a job this is a good place.
Safeway,1cqr2rqneas26800,3.0,To work at Safeway and keep the job you have to be quick and good at what you do. Attention to detail and good customer service is a must.  You might have to step outside your comfort zone and lead a different job. In the 2 years I was there I was in 3 different positions.
Safeway,1cqp0g0si52ur800,3.0,"It was a decent job, decent pay(primarily because Montgomery county's minimum wage is higher), a good amount of hours but not a lot of respect from upper management."
Safeway,1cqp03bilbrem800,5.0,Working for Safeway was a learning experience due to it was my first job at 17 and taught me how to talk to people and communicate with others. Everyone is extremely attentive and outgoing.
Safeway,1cqoq2325b86v800,3.0,"I was at a non union, I was promoted to manager 4 months into starting and had to run a department off of 3 people, being manager I was there 7 days a week for weeks on end. Turn over rate was very high."
Safeway,1cqnicmr5as26800,2.0,Baggjng groceries for 14 major annoying customers being lied to about the paper products in the bathrooms cleaning up spills and emptying trash carts.
Safeway,1cqn5mufrb8an800,1.0,I was frequently scheduled to work 6 days a week and was routinely denied vacation requests. Management would do everything they could to cut pharmacy hours even though we routinely met performance goals and operated in the black. Safeway's culture of pharmacy management is dangerous to the Patients and the Employee's health since hours have been reduced so much often you don't receive your breaks or have time to use the restroom since there is no coverage if you have to leave the pharmacy as required by law.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1cqm9bhhdb8an800,4.0,Safeway was a great place to work. The people were friendly and the job was simple but fast paced. Some of the courtesy clerk tasks are tedious but not hard.
Safeway,1cqm5gmg1aki0800,2.0,"Understaffed, low pay, non consistent hours. Poor leadership. Poor training. I worked in the meat department and the people were quite nasty at the branch I was at. Very homophobic and racist"

Safeway,1cqko8n2vakhv800,1.0,The Bakery department demanded too much while they kept cutting our hours and not paying enough to make a living. They pressure us to do so much in so little time.
Safeway,1cqkm2j0lb831800,5.0,"Loved working there, started off getting great hours and would get less week after week. It wasn't one of those this guy is bad let reduce hours so they quit, I had plenty of great complements from upper management. The problem was they over hired, instead of giving out more hours to current employees. Other than that Safeway was amazing."
Safeway,1cqk2mkmlb8am800,2.0,Company struggles with the ability to care about any employee individually making an unhealthy work environment. It was very quick for me to understand that even though I stayed for three years.
Safeway,1cqju4ss9aqi6800,4.0,"If you don't mind working around people and are a team player,then Safeway is a good company to work for.Especially if it's your first job. The only downfall I would say is,sometimes hours get cut or you could work a whole lot of hours."

Safeway,1cqhmipgdb86o800,4.0,"A typical day at work timing wise was not the mkst consistant. Having seniority over some of my co-workers, I got to chose when I get to work and how much I get to work throughout the week. On weekends I would always open because everyone worked 8 hours on the weekends and getting out at 1, I still got the rest of my day."
Safeway,1cqhkde0tbrei800,5.0,"i learned how to shelf products make cookies , costumer service bringing in shopping carts,  make bread , flower assortments i lked the working pace and it was very fun"
Safeway,1cqhhqnbgb86o800,4.0,Stressful environment. Especially during holiday season. Good benefits. Good people. Not a lot of room for growth. Raises only came in annually. Union company
Safeway,1cqgqci3obrei800,1.0,"Toxic working environment, low moral and extremely poor management. The store manager had the employees stressed out and demanded that you complete your tasks or possibly be dismissed."
Safeway,1cqgiu2g8b86o800,2.0,"The job is pretty much common sense however it is very routine and requires great time management. Corporate requires a HUGE amount of work done in each shift from each employee with only a small amount of time given and that time seems to be cut more and more each week, but the programs and new policies seem to be added. This makes it for a VERY stressful work environment. Corporate claims that the ""customer"" always comes ""first"" however....they seem to want their ""charts"" and ""production logs"" filled out as a priority when they come in for inspections, not accepting that customers take time."
Safeway,1cqfsvdn6akah800,2.0,Very interesting and fast past meet people who still are there fun clean and learned different departments meet new people and management worked at several different locations in Denver area ran a crew up to 9 safety classes audits white glove etc. Food safety knowledge and changing tags changing rotation of the product checking dates everyday checking food temperature safety with cleaning products training new crew members sell products vocals etc.

Safeway,1cqf3f5ojb8af800,4.0,"I had the opportunity to learn a lot of necessary basic skills while working for Safeway, a typical day of work allowed me to exercise my communication and customer service skills. The hardest part of my job was standing in one place on my feet for hours on end. Working for Safeway taught me how to use patience and compassion with customers. The management at that specific store was not very compassionate or understanding when I was undergoing a severe health condition at the time, i am an employee with a great amount of respect and expect that in return."
Safeway,1cqerhjqbb86k800,1.0,When I was working there I felt like I was a sheep that was being herded and the place was always filthy and the management didn't do any thing about people that were stealing. and they didn't let the coworkers go after them because the didn't want to be held responsible if thy got hurt.
Safeway,1cqenhojh9r5n800,5.0,Un día típico de trabajo es la atención permanente de los clientes. La cultura de atención es primordial para la empresa.
Safeway,1cqen85uaakdo801,4.0,I spent 3 years working for Safeway and I was constantly learning how to do new things. Every step of the way my superiors understood my value to the company and gave me different duties to complete. I ended up doing my own job duties as well as many other duties throughout the store. I enjoy learning new things so this was an amazing job atmosphere for me.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.

Safeway,1cqch64qp5nee800,5.0,Very Productive and professional. Safeway went above and beyond to motivate employees and lift morale at the workplace. Manager was really hard working and understanding to employees needs.The hardest part of the job was having to leave and relocate to take care of a sick family member. Overall my time at Safeway was great. I enjoyed going to work there for 7 years.

Safeway,1cq6tpdc9akac800,4.0,"Great place to work for, but you rarely see management and the supervisors are biased. More women are hired compared to men, sometimes they give you less hours, and have you try to do three things at once. The workplace culture is great, but they never prepare you for the seasons, and the people you meet are great people"

Safeway,1cq49ihjgb82k800,3.0,I started out in the deli and quickly advanced to assistant manager. “Training” was supposed to take up to a month but I was never properly trained. We were always understaffed but had to help customers promptly while also getting our daily tasks done. The store manager was reasonable and I could usually confide in him and he would help me relay information to my manager. I always had enough hours but I hadn’t been in a management position I wouldn’t have.
Safeway,1cq42ermpakdo800,3.0,its another job would I recommend working there? if times are tough yes or you're in need of a job right away yes everyone gets fed up being there because of management
Safeway,1cq3vnt3v5j67800,2.0,"Safeway Dot com is overly stressful for the actual work you are given, with no breaks, and extremely early work days. You can be employed for decades and still be labeled as part time unless you decide to do serous boot licking for the Corporate faceless suits, you will almost never see. Your benefits are non existent, as work for those already retired they seem to like it fine enough."
Safeway,1cq2vm4q3b8af800,1.0,"My experience with Safeway was terrible.  I had a racist manager who had questionable hiring practices and no respect for those he hired. I was forced into a Union that did nothing for it's workers and given little to no hours.  The entire work environment was cut throat.  I seen people thrown under the bus all so someone else could move up to a simple cashier position. Constantly we were asked to perform outside our job description without compensation, and if someone refused retribution was common in the form of hours being cut.   I decided to leave when I received a 0.00 dollar pay check due to Union Dues which I could not pay.  I wouldn't wish this ""job"" upon any person."
Safeway,1cq2ova1ob8af800,2.0,No set schedule and always busy. Its a great place for your first job and to get your foot into the workforce. You learn a lot about customer service and dealing with disgruntled customers. The best part about the job is the managers and your co-workers.

Safeway,1cq2eplt9brec800,4.0,A typical grocery store floral department. Friendly employees and customers. Always busy and new products coming in all the time. They are much more interested in numbers on a page than the actual people working in the store.
Safeway,1cq2dlndlaqhs800,1.0,Terrible management would always take away more and more hours away from my department. The clerks at the front end were just kids they hired and they got paid just as much as I did even though I worked my rear end off while they pushed a broom in one hand and gazed at their phones in the other.
Safeway,1cq1m1t7fb8af800,2.0,There is no direction at this time. The company seems to be struggling to find a cohesive direction and has replaced all upper level management since the merger.
Safeway,1cq1jpgrcb8af800,3.0,sometimes you are the only one on the job having to do the job of 3 people sometimes there's 3 people doing the job of one. just hope you get a good manager.

Safeway,1cq1bb6fgbrec800,3.0,The people you work with are nice and fun people. It is convenient being paid weekly.  the discounts on groceries add up quite a bit which makes Safeway a little more cost effective for employees. The down side is that as a single mother closing every night really is not conducive as you are not home after the kids are out of school. Your children's welfare should always come first.

Safeway,1cptoiusub82f800,2.0,honestly not a very good place to work management was consistently a joke always felt like you were coming in to pick up another workers slack consistently management was poorly done always was nerve wreck each and every single day and the night crew standards were very unrealistic with split days off each week  30 min lunches and barely good space in break periods deli was absolutely filthy behind the scenes and the conditions of the floors and etc
Safeway,1cpt4omesb8aa800,2.0,"We are purposefully under staffed all the time. There are always lines. There is no self checkout. Breaks are 2 ten minutes for 8 hours and sometimes you don't get to take both breaks. Your break is being timed even while in line to buy food. So you have 30 seconds to eat. There are no lunches allowed in the front end schedule. Your start pay is minimum wage. You are hired as an APC which means that you will be scheduled in produce, deli, and cashier all in the same week with random times of day every day. You may not accept tips. Most of the staff are ages 14 to 20. It's like working at a high school. You may be scheduled 6 days a week and not quite ever reach 40 hours a week. This is the reality of working for Safeway."
Safeway,1cpsuecfsb86f800,3.0,everything is just average. unwilling to give full-time employment status but more than willing to work their part-time employees 40 hours a week. could do better

Safeway,1cpqetii15j64800,2.0,It’s an okay to work if you’re full time. Part time employees don’t get enough hours. If you live alone you’ll need a second job to survive. If the company was to give more hours to people then it would be a much better place to work.
Safeway,1cpo5kclvbre7800,3.0,I would not suggest working there to a friend as it takes years to get good insurance and the pay is very low to start and the rate of increase is long
Safeway,1cpn9mbknb8aa800,3.0,I’m not sure if it’s the area I work in but the Deli OPS is a nightmare! You will never be good enough and it’s their way no matter what the circumstances are! They are constantly changing the rules and expectations. They don’t care that you have a family they only want you having split days off for their benefit! They will cut your hours but want perfection. They will rip you to shreds and want a professional relationship with you! You cannot treat people that way and expect good results! Positive reinforcement is the best way to manage any type of people! It’s proven that positive reinforcement works! Most issues are swept under the rug. Lots of favoritism not enough follow through with issues! No good communication between management and employees! I feel like I’m constantly compromising my faith because of this company!
Safeway,1cpm14v1lakdm800,4.0,"I was at a very busy store so even as a part time employee I could get up to 38 hrs in a week. Requesting time off was easy but not paid.

Safeway,1cpl5spfgb8aa800,3.0,Vons was not great. It's definitely an entry job which no potential. Vons take advantage of the best workers and let the lazy be lazy. Customers were truly amazing. That's pretty much it.
Safeway,1cpkv879lbre7800,2.0,"Working as a combo clerk for Vons was a very stressful environment with unfriendly employees and an uncooperative management. I love to be challenged and take upon any job that offers competitive pay. I'm a very determined, motivated, and a very hard worker. This position at Vons nearly killed me though with stress and low pay, not being able to pay for bills or buy myself food. I was told to do things outside of my certification and job description which not only violated OSHA, but the companies policies as well. I did not receive pay for clocking over to higher paying positions nor did I receive any help from the cooperate offices for Safeway. I had to contact HR just to have some things made different at Vons."

Safeway,1cpierhaiakhl800,3.0,If you have ever worked in a grocery store setting they are all the same. Safeway was okay i just did not get enough hours. I worked at the one in Rehoboth Beach DE and the pay there is a little bit better than average
Safeway,1cpi5m25kb82f800,5.0,*Average day was different from the next
Safeway,1cpi42bkhb8aa800,1.0,"Every day that I had to see my manager was the worst day of the week. She would forget to excuse me from my breaks, encourage other employees to be mean to me, and was overall a sociopath for no reason other than she did not like my face."
Safeway,1cpi1reb0akdm800,2.0,"Although Safeway is now Albertson/Safeway when I worked there it was only Safeway. Their priorities were back wards, the Directions given were conflicting and did not promote success or confidence in the future. Only results mattered and the constant pressure to get things done with limited hours resulted in the necessity to spend time working without pay to keep from getting fired. It was truly one of the worst retail experiences of my life."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1cpi1g88db8aa800,3.0,"Coworkers and immediate management worked well together. Company culture not positive, employees were treated as disposable and corporate seemed out of touch."
Safeway,1cphj8r2lbre7800,3.0,"Safeway was my first actual job out of high school, it was a great job. I only wished i got paid more, or worked more hours. I also wished they had employee discounts, because making as little as i was and having to pay full price for food was hard. But overall its a great starting job just so you can gain and collect work ethic."
Safeway,1cpgut37vb86f800,4.0,One of the places that will take a high school student. I didn't learn much besides cash handling. It wasn't that great of a job. I worked a lot of different departments so that I could pick up hours and the bakery was the best.
Safeway,1cpgg6en5bre2800,3.0,"I walk in seeing how much the morning crew did during the morning, after that I walk into the back to see if anyone else is there. If I don't see anyone I start on working on the holes in the wall and then work on tins."
Safeway,1cpfooh2jb868800,5.0,"My manager was amazing and flexible. When people say: ""When you have a good manager and coworkers, work can actually be pretty enjoyable"" they mean it. Because while working in the bakery was pretty taxing; having a good manager and fun, caring coworkers really did make things ten times better. Everyone went from being coworkers to quickly becoming pretty much my family and I actually kinda miss working there. :)"
Safeway,1cpfkhk6kb8a5800,3.0,"the ""training was on your own but required. you where always needing to be actively doing something even if it did not make sense."
Safeway,1cpe4ca5cb8a5800,1.0,My typical day of working at safeway was to clock in make sure my register is clean and ring up customers bag there merchandise and also try to be friendly with the customers. I hated management .
Safeway,1cpcue5o1as1i800,4.0,"I worked the graveyard shift and threw overnight freight and stocked shelves, was a fast paced workplace but you learn a lot of things as you go and my co workers were awesome so it made the night shifts better. The hardest part of the job would probably have been throwing freight for 4 hours a night but it ended up being a good workout. Overall I loved the job I just had to relocate because I wasn't making enough money to live on the Oregon coast because the cost of living is expensive on the coast."
Safeway,1cpch2u5a5ne5800,4.0,"I like working at Safeway. But the location I’m at in Virginia, I’m only getting between 4-7 hours everyday and 30 or less hours during the week. Management is okay. Customers are some what okay. Very quick paced environment."
Safeway,1cpblbdvfas1i800,4.0,It’s a good place to work have 401k make good money by order selecting have to be standing lifting always running had to be quick on your feet and fast with your hands
Safeway,1cpbj67ahb868801,3.0,"Poor pay, not enough hours little chance for advancement, schedule is only posted up to several days in advance. Safeway use to hire full time and at a good rate of pay back in the 80's before being purchased by Albertson's"
Safeway,1cpaflbqtb8a5800,4.0,You can survive working here . great  job security. Awesome employees all around a very good job. You can learn alot in each department theres alot to learn.

Safeway,1cp87gi2jbre2800,3.0,I applied as a cashier. At first I was working 40 hours a week. Then the hours started dropping. Then I was being placed in areas I was untrained in and never applied for. I quit.
Safeway,1cp83a588bre2800,5.0,this company you want to work for they are union and they give benefits.
Safeway,1cp7kc8ta5j5v800,4.0,"In the administrative part, of my job, answer calls, pull files set up conference rooms, set interviews, file type. Learned how Human Resources work. My supervisor was a hands on person, a good trainer. Workplace culture was very good and fun at times. There was no really hard part of the job. Good part of the job got to volunteer for a lot of events, that would not have had access to."
Safeway,1cp6dojljb868801,3.0,"If you have great coworkers or the atmosphere of Safeway then you'll enjoy it, otherwise, there's not many benefits that are applicable. For the work that you are required to do, the pay is very little. I worked at Safeway in Seattle for a year, was at the level four pay scale in the union and made $15 an hour. I tried getting a transfer, and was only offered $11.40 an hour at a level two because I was told other workers would feel bad if I came in at $15 when they weren't making that much yet. I left."
Safeway,1cp5pic78b868800,4.0,I had not once had a set schedule to follow and was worked shifts I said I was not able to resulting in me missing days or having to cancel plans outside of work.
Safeway,1cp4s5r66akdf800,2.0,"Safeway is a high paced very unoriganzed company. Shifts varied. Employee turn over was very high. In my positions. I was suppose to be only in charge of sandwich stations, yet I ended up having to be in charge of the whole deli."
Safeway,1cp3q8lfh5na5800,2.0,I really enjoyed working with my manager and his team he was great they just don't offer any benefits or medical coverage and I have a family so I needed those thing.

Safeway,1cp3ejvrrb828800,4.0,"It is a nice environment to work at because, my co-workers and all of our employees, in general, are nice and caring and friendly. It's fun to work together with others and interact with many customers."
Safeway,1cp2qb5k6b8a5800,2.0,"Safeway is a steady and often fast paced work environment that is union supported. You start at the bottom and have opportunities to work your way up into different positions but it is entirely dependant on management who are often unreliable, unreasonable or play favorites and discriminate both against races or persons."
Safeway,1cp2j3guv5j5v800,4.0,"Depending on the area covered by the tech, it can be quite stressful. on call 2 weeks every 3 months covering the Eastern division was complicated at times and took away from family life."
Safeway,1cp2is9ur52u8800,2.0,it is a great work place. i just believe their needs to be better management and team work. i enjoy what i do and like the customers. i also like the fact i get paid every week.
Safeway,1cp2ilvl1b8a5800,3.0,I've worked for safeway for almost a year now it first i liked the job but then after it's gets really bad once you start to work me working there i never got bumped up to anything and even though i want to but they never did. So my hardest part working there is if your going to school sometimes  he doesn't work with it.
Safeway,1cp2g2an0b828800,3.0,i worked in the deli it was nice like your own island in the store it could get busy with customers but the most was cooking and preparing food and making shore the food didnt go bad
Safeway,1cp286pobakdf800,4.0,For the most part I had a great crew.  Communication with my team was productive.  I was consistently in the top three producers and so set the example.  They were competitive and that made for a better team.  Store management backed us up and were helpful when needed.  I miss working there.
Safeway,1cp1ioarcak68800,3.0,The work depends if your flexible. Opening is the best or closing. I learned it gets stressful and have to be well focused to detail and very high spirited meaning greet the customers in great attitude. Solve problems. definitely communication is key to not only customers but to team members to achieve your goal in a situation. The hardest part of the job is if dealing with a rude customer or your low on staff and have a lot of people that are need in help. the most enjoyable is meeting new people and interesting things at nigh shifts.
Safeway,1cp1e1g98bre2800,3.0,"I would not refer a friend or family to work at Safeway, unless it is absolutely necessary. poor management and highly stressful, doesn't work well with requested time off"

Safeway,1cp1553gsb8a4800,5.0,All the managers are helpful and encourage you to do your best and are always available if you have questions. The hours were pretty flexible when I was working there. I enjoyed everyone I worked alongside.
Safeway,1cp0vecv5b827800,3.0,New hires were making $3.00 more an hour to start then I was making after 2 1/2 years. I was offered a promotion to cheese specialist I accepted. Unfortunately I still had my deli manager as manager. She refused to let me do my job. There were many things she would not let me do as was listed in my job description. These things of course reflected on my job rating. It was impossible to do my job right.
Safeway,1cp0efg625na4800,3.0,"I would start the day at a nearby Safeway store, clock in, and access a computer to look at my current repair order tickets.  I learned a lot about retail environment and the IT equipment used.  The culture was a busy workplace environment, but respectful.  The hardest part of the job was prioritizing repair tickets with the distance between Safeway stores.  Management is always busy but responsive to my inquiries."
Safeway,1cp02a3e45na4800,4.0,Nice place to work. Friendly people.  Great customers.  Friendly people. Nice place to work.   Great customers.  Great customers. Nice place to work. Friendly people.

Safeway,1cov2obahb867800,1.0,"Did not like working here. The pay was very low. I got written up for being late once in 2 years. Do not recommend working here. Store manager was fired for sexually harassing underage employees, dangerous to work here late at night.. (not after close obviously)"
Safeway,1coua687gbrdv800,4.0,I started my day as someone who put all the baked goods away.I cut all the bread to go into bags.put all the doughtnuts away and then the bagels. I woulkd help the customers to pick ouy what the wanted.  Sometime I wrote messages on the cake.I always made sure the bakery was neat and clean. the hardest part of my job wasmaking sure all the items were out at the right time
Safeway,1cotsh1jfb865800,5.0,Would still work there if i could get a full time position. There was as lot of teamwork and the managers were kind.  The hardest part of the job was retrieving carts in the summer months.
Safeway,1cotkv8lsb825800,5.0,Fun and productive place to work. Customers were great and the people I worked with are a amazing. Other than the wage and hours given I would have stayed there longer
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1cotke6g5b825800,2.0,"This is a dead end job that will suck the life and soul out of you.  The company cares about business, not the employees running the business.  You will work every weekend and holiday.  You will never see your family and friends.  And you will never be full time as all employees are hired at part time only with a minimum of twenty four hours a week."
Safeway,1cotfe7lbbrdv800,4.0,"the employees and managers were all nice to work with there, and they were very kind and friendly. I knew that this job was going to be temporary, but I still liked working there."
Safeway,1cosih5j4b8a2800,4.0,"There isn’t much to get excited about, unless you’re really into bagging groceries, pushing shopping carts, and taking out trash. If that’s you, you’ll love this job."
Safeway,1cos7j6vcb865800,4.0,I enjoy working there because it's fast pace . Dealing with different type customer can be a challenge. But it's a great experience to interact with variety people.
Safeway,1cos6uk5tb825800,5.0,In this job I was able to be crossed trained in many different departments. I was able to have advancement opportunities and as long as the hours were available if you wanted them you could have them. It was a great first job to be able to learn responsibility and the value of good work ethic.
Safeway,1corfvo6bb8a2800,4.0,I love working there but ever since Albertsons bought us out things have gone down hill. Our schedule that changes weekly i now put through auto scheduling instead of in store where we know how many people are going to need on certain days. I can live with the low pay and everything it suggests the scheduling that messes with me since I can't plan anything ahead of time nor do we ever seem to have enough workers. Also to clarify as a courtesy clerk we are only allowed to be part time and only guaranteeing 16 hours a week.
Safeway,1corb730sbrdv800,1.0,Got my hours cut because the bakery manager didn't like that I was getting decorating training. Didn't tell me at the time. All managers and supervisors were like this. There's no loyalty.
Safeway,1cor7l0fbb825800,3.0,customer service on a daily basis would be the most enjoyable part of the day.  everyday consists of new and challenging tasks.  Assisting customers with positive outcomes and looking for salutations to some concerns.
Safeway,1cor4qg3gb865800,2.0,"It was an okay place to work, just no advancement it seemed liked, the people I worked with was probably the best thing about the job, told me I’d get full time hours and never got a full 40 hours."
Safeway,1coql9l60as1f800,2.0,"Since it's merger with Albertsons Companies, it has fallen apart.  No annual reviews are done so no one else besides your direct manager knows how hard you work or what you accomplished.  No raises most years but if you are given one it is offset by the increase in health care cost.  While health care cost went up benefits went down.   Company tries to maintain a positive image and hide all their dirty laundry."
Safeway,1copg4i77as1e800,5.0,"Being the lead staff member for the Deli Department,  is an enjoyable experience.  I enjoy working in giving the best service to each and every customer I Tacoma in contact with.  I also understand the importance of setting the right professional example for my co workers to model."
Safeway,1coom56naakdb800,3.0,"Safeway is a company ran by corporate. Safeway is a great place to start working with customer service at the start of an early career. I chose to work for Safeway due to the flexibility while I was attending school full time. It is a very stressful environment as you start moving into the management team of the company. I would recommend this job to anyone interested in customer service, so they can get a feel of what to look forward to."
Safeway,1cooggh7db8a1800,4.0,keep up on produce dept and knowledge of product in season
Safeway,1coo9h4jrbrdu800,4.0,"Nice place to work. Early hours. Paid every week. Typical day would be breaking down the load in the order you will work it. Then stock all product on shelves, then order for the next days load. Finally you face the department so everything looks good."
Safeway,1convo595akdb800,1.0,"I prefer not to discuss the very negative work environment at Safeway. Honestly, it varies greatly depending on which location and what job title you are working."
Safeway,1conoqi2tb824800,3.0,At the beginning Safeway was a great place to work at but after a year everyone started to be rude to me and stopped talking to me and would get me into trouble for no reason so I had to quit because i was not happy.
Safeway,1comqhp4ab864800,3.0,"It was generally a good place to work but for the amount of labor you put in, it didn’t amount to the pay. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to my fellow co workers."
Safeway,1comk49t5b824800,1.0,I did not like this job it is very fast paced and you are not paid for everything that you do. Honestly I would not go back even if I had no option left
Safeway,1comhckb7ak64800,4.0,The day would begin with a routine inspection of the work area to be sure it is ready for shoppers. Next would be the collection of carts well before time and make sure they were ready for the customer.
Safeway,1combkaupbrdu800,4.0,I enjoyed working here but the management is awful. We would go days even weeks without some supplies because the manager of our department wouldnt order it in time. Good flexible hours if youre okay with having to make-do with what you have. it makes the job 10x harder in my opinion.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1com4vh7nb864800,3.0,"Depending on what department you get placed in, it will either make or break the experience for you. The pay is different in every department. They often keep employees on that are not good at their jobs or often leave the department for chunks at a time. Leaving the people who work hard to pick up the slack."
Safeway,1com4u6c0b864800,1.0,When hired they promised you basically the world and that you'd be able to advance quickly into better positions with better pay. None of anything they said were true.
Safeway,1com4bfv3b864800,3.0,"Can make a decent living working full time here. Managers were poorly cooperative, did not communicate or relay information well. Somewhat lazy in laying down policies."
Safeway,1colpb47fb824800,3.0,Safeway is a struggling component of a large grocery conglomerate.  The individual stores are more concerned about daily profits than establishing long=term sustainable profits.  This makes for a stressful environment as the individual stores operate on the lowest amount of staff to complete the most amount of work.
Safeway,1cojrnspubrdu800,3.0,Safeway is an okay place to work I wouldn't recommend working at the deli customers are impatient sometimes rude and the store has a lot of thefts the employees are pretty cool and helpful manager of the store isnt really all that helpful and if you work deli and closing you dont get paid enough to do some of the work they give you but it's a pretty good first job
Safeway,1coj7qf1ab864800,2.0,I believe our store would be a great place to work if we had a manager who truly cared about his employees. If we had safety from outside harassment and violence.
Safeway,1cohg0281b824800,1.0,"I was stuck working by myself all the time, no breaks my lunch would be spent in the kiosk having to wait on customers while on my lunch hour. The corporation could care less about you, and they tell you , if you leave someone is there to take your place! I would NOT recommend working there, they play favorites, they let the people that they favor take extra breaks and do whatever they want."
Safeway,1cohff3d3b864800,3.0,"Safeway is a fast paced working environment. You must be a fast learner, fast on your feet,reliable, and loyal. Must have good people skills and patience."
Safeway,1coh59f2ob824800,4.0,"Its a great company to work for, You have the opportunity to move up quickly. The people that work there are amazing to work with. The best part of working there is the benefits, and the people."
Safeway,1cogtl3e8brdu800,4.0,good place to start a career but you defiantly have to bounce around your shifts changing every week and hard to get full time spot it is nice once you get your inc they have a very good plan but first level is not  that great after a year you will receive dental
Safeway,1coggan81b8a1800,2.0,"Wasn't trained very well before being thrown out to the fuel station and not all the job requirements were explained before I was hired. The customers were sometimes very nasty and most were always in a hurry. We were expected to wait on the customers, clean the kiosk, the kiosk bathroom, the two out bathrooms, the fuel pumps and fuel stations, empty many trash cans, put out merchandise, and other duties. I am a very productive worker, but what Safeway asks of someone per shift is a JOKE!!  And we had to pay union dues.  Most employees I worked were Very unhappy, stressed, and OVER- worked.  Many of the inside cashiers were climbing over one another to show their swiftness in ringing up customers, their ""so-called Skills"", etc.  I avoided those cashiers and others who worked the customer service desk who thought they were Above Everyone else - if only the know what the other employees Really think of them!"
Safeway,1cogafnbjak64800,5.0,"fast paced environment. met some wonderful people over the years of working at the same store for 24 years. flexible hours, decent pay and excellent benefits."
Safeway,1coer53bob823800,5.0,"Excellent place to work. People  I worked with were great people, I also enjoyed the customers. It was so nice to see that same customers every week.."
Safeway,1coeo1v02b8a0800,4.0,Overall experience at Safeway was good. People were to work with. Customers were always grateful for assistance. Short staffed so clerks were always doing several tasks when register clerks needed assistance the most. Flexibility wasn’t as stated before hiring.
Safeway,1coek76uhak63800,3.0,my typical day at work is very calm . I learned how to lead customers around the store. The management was not that great but since we have anew one its starting to pick up good services. The workplace is a safe environment to work in . The hardest part of the job is knowing most of the answers to the  customer question.  The most fun part about the job is to see everyone smiling and working together  as one whole family.
Safeway,1coejq6ihbrdt800,3.0,"On a typical day, I would have to clean bathrooms, bring in shopping carts from outside in any/all weather, help customers unload their groceries into their cars, take both perishable and non-perishable items back to either shelves or to the designated department, emptying garbage cans, and putting recyclables into the baler (among other tasks). The environment would go from near-empty to slammed quickly. My coworkers were nice, and kept the job interesting and fun."
Safeway,1coe8mv4hb8a0800,3.0,They don't pay well for the work they ask of you and they don't treat you well. They expect a lot out of you but don't appreciate the work you do. I worked there for 5 years with a dollar raise. my last job I earned over a two dollar raise in less than 2 years.
Safeway,1coe79bfmbrdt800,5.0,"Great job for busy parents, flexible schedule. not enough hours to go around. I go in often now as a customer and its not what it is used to be. Not customer friendly, not much customer service either."
Safeway,1coe2s0bpaqhb800,5.0,I enjoyed this job thoroughly. Very fast paced and customer service oriented. Pay was really good with options to climb the ranks and get paid more and offered position changes and promotions.
Safeway,1codumanfak9t800,5.0,Very nice company to work for. They work with you as a team. Managers are typically very nice and work place is relaxed as long as you do your job. Benefits are nice.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1cochkelpb860800,4.0,Would've loved to still be working there unfortunately Some Vons  stores closed down   and ended up in merging with Albertsons .So I along with other co workers ended up leaving the company .
Safeway,1coa93kmbb89q800,5.0,"always busy and work with a fast pace. in one week iv learned how to refund a item,make a return and how to recieve a payment when a customer is writting a check and the proper procedure to do to verify the account# and check id to avoid any fraud. managment is very attentive and hands on when teaching anything and they answer all my questions. the only thing that gets difficult for me is when dealing with upset customers or shoplifters. but for the most part i enjoy the people i work with, everyone is really easy going and have good attitudes."
Safeway,1co9t2hptas18800,4.0,a typical day at Safeway I would star at the cash register or self check out and greet my shift lead and manager as well as customers I see on a daily  bases and even the new faces .
Safeway,1co9h3564ak5t802,5.0,"My job at Safeway as a Dot Com Associate was an enjoyable one and a unique experience for me. My job simply involved picking groceries for the online orders that came through the store - but I also worked on the file maintenance team from time to time. I learned more about products and how the store organized and categorized them on the shelves. The management always felt on top of everything and always working hard to keep the store operating at its best. I would say that the hardest part of the job would have to be the days when we had to pick large quantities of items with minimal staff. Everything got done, but the physical labor took a toll and the hours ran late. However, I enjoyed working for a service that was great for those who could not come to the store directly to buy groceries and working with my other coworkers. I hope that other stores adopt this service as it can provide more jobs and help communities."
Safeway,1co9dq5isb89q800,4.0,"From clocking on, to clocking out, there is always something to do. It is different in each department. But I did enjoy working for Safeway in the floral department."
Safeway,1co9dhomqbrdq800,2.0,Safeway was a great place to work until they were bought out by an investment firm. Now all of the stores are understaffed and shelves are empty. It is difficult to run a good store if their are not enough people to do the work.
Safeway,1co98bmg4akh6800,3.0,"Safeway is not a horrible place to work by any means but it also does not provide much room for growth. In my experience, Safeway has done the bare minimum with training, benefits to employees, and compensation."
Safeway,1co985ja9b89q800,5.0,"Good customers service,different positions, growth in the company.weekly pay best benefits. best hours to work. can relocate. Good people to work with."
Safeway,1co918p06b820800,1.0,this ob was okay no need to say anything about it it was a job so that why  i would not go back the pay is not good either but it was not bad for the time being
Safeway,1co7go6tibrdp800,3.0,The supervisor could use a little help in communication other than that the last minute overtime call was not cool and being forced to stay is not good either
Safeway,1co6dipp4ak5r800,4.0,It was great working with the kiddos on the unit and helping them find ways to cope.  It was extremely stressful at times because of short staffing which was unsafe for both staff and patients.
Safeway,1co5rdpp952tr801,4.0,Kind of wish I had more hours at the particular time hoping that they will be a little bit flexible because I end up getting sick I end up being now announce with cancer
Safeway,1co4u3a30brdp800,3.0,Managers were adequate although there were a few great ones. Inconsistent schedules can hurt. Everyone gets along pretty well in general you just need to have a quick pace.
Safeway,1co46019hb81v800,2.0,"Though I would love to give a positive review, I simply can't. By no means is this a bad job if you need to pay bills or save money, but the company seems to want to milk the most work for the least amount of pay. I worked in the deli for 2 years and am not considered a food clerk which, by default, gets paid and tops out higher than a non food clerk. I worked for 2 years and got raises based on hours worked that were 10 cents for over one thousand hours of work. I went through multiple Store directors and Deli crews, and the management never felt consistent. In my personal store I went through a lot of stress and borderline harassment from my managers, but the biggest thing I have trouble dealing with is the fact that someone they like better gets treated better by a long shot. You also can't transfer between districts, so when I moved I lost all of my raises and was back to the bottom of the barrel and being scheduled less than 20 hours when I was used to 40. My coworkers that have been there for over 20 years have a better contract than I and they only seem to be getting worse. Used to be a great company, but now care only about money. One example of this is taking away cloth rags from Deli and Meat departments and switching to disposable paper towels that simply don't get the job done as quickly or effectively as cloth rags just to save a buck."

Safeway,1cnutqmfsb85v800,3.0,The staff there was not bad. In fact over all I would say they where great. But the pay was simply not enough for the work put in. The nature of our customers was such that it made the job almost intolerable compared to other establishments I have worked at and they where times where I was afraid someone was going to rob us.
Safeway,1cnuspqjjb81v800,2.0,A typical day at Safeway was fast pace very stressful. I learned that some people in management need to take classes to help them be a better manager and worked better with their employees. The workplace culture. The hardest part was being rush to complete customers orders. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday and working with some nice co-workers
Safeway,1cnta8b87b81v800,4.0,"In my particular experience I found the area of the store I was placed in was very poorly managed and everyone knew it. Though the upper management tried to help with more people the department manager did not train, they did not seem knowledgeable of the department and how to create a less stressful environment for the employees, and the two shifts were quick to place blame on the other rather than try to work together to run the department more cohesively. Often the department was understaffed for the workload and it caused a obvious strain on the employees to stay on top of the tasks. Over all the workplace was quite negative. Though there were a few wonderful employees many that I dealt with were disgruntled to how management handled issues in the workplace."
Safeway,1cnsujmbqb89p800,5.0,"I really enjoyed the job and the environment. I had hoped to continue my employment for many years. But a manager of a different department was promoted to the front end without being properly trained and did not appreciate the methods I had been taught.

Safeway,1cnqu094ab89l800,4.0,"I enjoy working at Safeway, sometimes you have to lift heavy items and that can put a strain on your body. Also standing for hours on end can be tough. Sometimes the best part about going to work is knowing that I get to talk to people all day, you eventually build a relationship with each customer and you feel like your part of their family."
Safeway,1cnq557leb89jbvd,5.0,"I would love to keep working at Safeway/Albertsons company until I retire. I like the grocery store setting, where the customers just come in and shop around while their prescriptions are filled. Also a huge plus is the lack of drive-thru (it may not be every store)."

Safeway,1cno9a2sn5j5ffs4,3.0,"My typical day at work was usually unorganized. Being as though things were not always not complete on shifts before mine. I would have to finish or pick up after an earlier shift over all it was pretty smooth. I learned how to multi task , triple task at times when it was busy. Also made me better with my time management and people skills. Management was leiniant on their shifts sometimes inconsistent. Usually it was a well managed day they managers were there if you needed help or was confused on a certain task. Work culture was pretty consistent the environment was well managed the employees were nice and they seemed pretty focuesd on thier job. The hardest part of the job was dealing with an customer who was out of control and saying things that were not too nice and not telling the truth to others. The most enjoyable part of my job was going in and seeing the smile on the customers face when u interact with them. Even informing them on some information was pleasing on a dail basis."
Safeway,1cno6gc19b85obbf,1.0,I disliked this job. The manangers were alright. It’s a great store it just didn’t suit me personally. Managers weren’t always cooperative at times. But other than that it was fine
Safeway,1cnnsr31sak9i9k1,4.0,Every day I went to work it was a spontaneous routine of attending to all work available from going to help a checker in need of bagging for customers and keeping spontaneous whenever there was other work to find within the store. It was easy to be dependable and attentive to the customers and employees whenever help was needed and I remained on my feet to be useful. It could be stressful to get rushed or running back and forth to get price checks or item checks on very fast-paced days but I managed to make it through with keeping everyone pleased and satisfied. It was a friendly collaborative and steadfast working environment overall and it has been easy to miss the spontaneous fast-paced routine that it was all about.
Safeway,1cnnpnd3o5n9kff5,1.0,There is a lack of opportunity for you to build a career.  This particular location was based off of who you know instead of the work you do.  Popularity was more important than work ethic

I learned that being apart of a successful team, work environment means having a diverse group of personalities.

Time management and staying on task is key to being successful at this job, regardless of position or title."

Safeway,1cnfmscnjb85k94e,4.0,"This is a great first job or temporary job. Hours and scheduling is flexible, but usually for long hours as Deli staffing is generally low. Deli is a great place to learn and develop skills needed in other career paths. You learn self-control, time management, suggestive selling, collaborating with other departments and co-workers, and organization. Management is nice, but would push more onto you then they realize, often adding unnecessary stress to unrealistic goals. Although customers can be irate at times, they in addition to your co-workers are what really makes work enjoyable. Cracking a couple jokes, catching up with a regular, and looking forward to seeing those faces can make any day a good one."
Safeway,1cnfc938vb81ka5l,1.0,"A typical day at work consisted of working with great coworkers but there was never enough as there were lines out the door constantly.  Management was very lazy, they had control over a manager's card and the cashiers had to wait for them to walk from the back to the front of the store. The hardest part of this job was making every customer happy as they waited in line to pay for their groceries. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that I worked with, they made the job bearable."
Safeway,1cnd98ds1akcsdnp,2.0,"Very sad place to work. I feel horrible for the ladies I worked with, mainly the night shift deli ladies.

Safeway,1cnd4vt7sb89fe4o,4.0,i have worked there for 8 months and it was great and the only reason why i left was only because my hours did get cut a lot and i at that time did get a new job that did happen to pay better but i definitely would have stayed if i had my original hours

If it gets busy, then the time working there passes by quickly, but if there is no business, you just stand at your cash register doing nothing. The management at my specific Safeway that I work at is abysmal. They stay hidden in their office and do not come out and try to help out around the store. This also leads to some co-workers of mine thinking that they can do whatever they want and not actually work. The management also does not care if you ask for sick days or personal days off. They will still write you into the schedule and then task you with finding someone to replace you for the day."

Safeway,1cmql8nf4b89dc4k,3.0,There is no such thing as a typical work day being that you are working retail with the general public. Very fast paced and must be someone who is high energy.

Safeway,1cm6563rf5j51dp6,5.0,I had hoped to retire from there but the department shut down and all employees were let go.    This department was fast paced and was well known.
Safeway,1cm60qc45b8179m4,4.0,I enjoyed my position as a courtesy clerk. and the collaboration of co-workers with exception to a couple of employees who made me feel very uncomfortable when I needed to ask something work related.
Safeway,1cm5vu6f6b894fm8,4.0,Working for safeway was challenging as per the hours they needed workers.  A devide from employees and managers. Customers were great.  Some work there was fun and exciting.
Safeway,1cm5ic2ljbrd4ac3,4.0,"Overall it's a great company that loves their customers and does their best to constantly improve. Individual locations need work though. I worked at two different states, one store was fantastic, the other had horrible management and did not treat employees well."
Safeway,1cm4jgn42brd395a,5.0,I enjoy helping customers and seeing my regulars. Cutting meat is oddly satisfying. Preparing food is very high paced and out of my comfort zone but I enjoy it.
Safeway,1cm3k2uqh1bgf35r,5.0,gather material to build the scaffolds needed for other jobs. The work we did there you learn to work as a team and not an individual. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the heat but the crew i was with mad the days pass by fast.

Safeway,1cm1svbilb856964,2.0,I worked for safeway for little over a year and it has been the worst working environment I've ever been in. Toxic work environment and poor management and hours. Overworked employees for full time positions. And unsafe work place due to dangerous cutomers.
Safeway,1cm1l2135brd3ct5,2.0,It was a good job to have as a student. They worked with my school schedule and they had flexible hours in the position I had. I don't recommend this job to any who doesn't like meeting new people or have to stand on your feet for long period of times.

The hardest part of my job is dealing with some of the customers."
Safeway,1cm179fqjb816fub,2.0,"I was a bagger and moved into a cashier position. The bagger position will never get a raise unless they move to another department. Cashiers start out at minimum wage and won't see a raise until after a large sum of hours are worked, not yearly based. They kept the cashiers at 25-35 hours a week, which meant you would not see that raise for almost 2 years of work. It started out okay with the first set of managers that were in place. Everyone worked as a team and excelled. New managers came in and changed everything about our team that was working great and things went bad quickly. Most of the employees that I worked with, are now gone from that specific store due to the bad management."
Safeway,1cm15l0f0b8169lb,2.0,come in and work somewhere people when they shop there rude and disrespectful  and most of the time they take there anger out on the workers at safeway that are judt trying to do theyre jobs.

Safeway,1clvibcuhb813dtv,5.0,I truly loved my job at Safeway(Vons) and it was almost fully because of the employees and managers that were their. Customers sometimes made days better but the environment that employees made and how comfortable they were with managers made everything better. The few times it was stressful was sometimes due to other employees not completely their jobs or on certain holidays like Labor Day and July 4th and Thanksgiving which require a lot of groceries.
Safeway,1clvge9dqb89094u,3.0,Safeway was a great company to work for it was a good learning experience. I appreciated the opportunity they I had while working with the company and the skills I learned there.
Safeway,1clv95rgub890dtf,3.0,"Too many different tasks, environment too stressful, low pay. The hours were mostly pretty flexible. The job often spreads you too thin, and seemingly expects you to be able to be in multiple places at once."
Safeway,1clv6k1o6b813d2k,3.0,"If understaffed for the day, it is heck, otherwise it's doable. The management is okay. There are a few health standard issues, like 2 month expired food products"
Safeway,1clus1ncjb8909bu,5.0,"Great place to work. Excellent benefits. Worked for Safeway for over 20 years. Its extremely fast paced. You need to be quick, make good decisions and handle multiple demands at a moments notice while still taking care of the most important part. The customers!"
Safeway,1cluouf6g1bae1l7,3.0,The management team made it hard to enjoy the job but the costumers are what made the job worth while. It was a busy environment and there were always tasks to complete.
Safeway,1clunnhveb890avc,3.0,"Fun place to work. Diverse group of people to interact with on a daily basis. Store is well maintained and the equipment required to do the assigned task, is readily available. Safeway is community oriented with respect to special events that take place throughout the year. A safe and clean place to work."
Safeway,1cluml7crb890d6r,3.0,"Can be a fun easy paced working environment with good vibes and happy people. Or can be a stressful, chaotic and unfair place. Really depends on your Manager and if they like you. Definitely lacks structure if you ever wanna move up"
Safeway,1clulju99b8538om,4.0,I am an Associate at Safeway and one of the most enjoyable parts of my job is the interaction with all my regular customers who have shopped here for years. I have fantastic management and co-workers.
Safeway,1clucuq22brd0fp3,3.0,A typical day at Safeway was ringing up items all day. I learned about many food products. My manager there was really flexible and understanding. The hardest part of the job was learning all the codes for the produce. The easiest was scanning the items. The environment was really easy-going.
Safeway,1clu2s5asb853dem,5.0,"Helping others, Routing orders, providing customer service. Working with great people. Making sure customers at home and Business got their products. Keep the flow going."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1cltuei1jb813eh6,1.0,I've worked at safeway before and this store by far has the worst management you will encounter. Mangers pass off all their work to whoever is not busy as they do nothing. Hostile work environment where checkers will complain to managers if you do not assist them bagging even though that is not your responsibility.
Safeway,1clttnmlr52t0ert,4.0,Typical day was doing the best to satisfy customer's needs.
Safeway,1clsq9iq5b853e3a,4.0,"Safeway runs a tight work force. Hours depend on your strengths. I recommend working at Safeway. If you want it , its all yours. People working for the people. A fine work place for contiued success of a company."
Safeway,1clscei0b1bgc0pr,3.0,"Typical corporation that is about making money rather than providing an environment that is good to be a human in. Hardest part of the job, going there, to be around angry people, its a culture of 'find someone else to do the tasks that you don't want to complete yourself.'"
Safeway,1clrrkt7fb89099g,3.0,"Started as a ""Courtesy Clerk"".  Worked many different departments before becoming night supervisor.  No regular weekly schedule.  Hours changed regularly depending on sales numbers.  Benefits were great at the time, but that as over 13 years ago, I""m sure that has changed substantially."
Safeway,1clrm54p8ak50c3v,3.0,Working for Safeway was good. Scheduling could get crazy at times do to the lack of help. They do have the right people staffed to train new and current employees. You must have and open mind and schedule before you apply knowing what to expect.
Safeway,1clr7sqqb5nd0av7,5.0,"Fun, fast paced and never a dull moment. Advancement came to those who worked hard. Great training and helpful managers who wanted you to be successful."
Safeway,1clplkuvib813dgb,4.0,"Started out as a bagger with the company. After 1.5 years, moved up to liquor department. After 6 months, moved up to become a manger in the department of another store. Six months after that, i ended up quitting due to personal reasons. Over the course of time of my employment with the company, i've noticed a difference in work ethic between workers in the store and corporate workers. In my opinion, the corporate workers tend to come off as intimidating as when everytime they visit a store, the store employees mood suddenly will change, and the overall vibe becomes less mellow and relaxed and more intense. Hopefully that can change."
Safeway,1clo0nnivbrd0ae6,3.0,"Well for starters when I was placed there I was doing good in the mid morning shift.. but when they moved me to graveyard shift,  it was hard. Because I didn’t know where everything was and I was lost most of the time."
Safeway,1cln77sl9brd09hl,1.0,"I ask for more hours and didn't get it . Ask if I can go to another department and was dined. More responsibility then the other in my department ,that all I can say."
Safeway,1clmv201jbrd0eeh,4.0,I like the people I work with every day.  It can be difficult walking around for long periods of time on the concrete but a good pair of shoes goes a long way.
Safeway,1clmnn3m7b853aue,3.0,"Didn't care for this job...to many people with attitudes, including management.  Didn't care for shift hours and/or being on my feet all day.  Benefits were decent."
Safeway,1clmmfrm3b813988,4.0,"I had many roles at Safeway. I started in the Deli working with food and that was very fast paced and sometimes stressful because there was not enough staffing. Then I moved to customer service desk which I liked, there was a lot of paper work involvement which became easier overtime. I did safe counts, money orders, western unions, and plenty more. I also helped out in floral quite often learning about the different arrangements of sorts, especially in the busy seasons such as mother's day and valentines day. I would definitely say that Safeway is a career opportunity for growth and expansion."
Safeway,1clmkc5sbb890dtg,1.0,"Place sucks, don't work there. There if its for a short time. The place is very depressing, everyone on there will back stab you or are two faced. Too much drama!"
Safeway,1clk80m3h1bae7lg,5.0,"Always giving above and beyond costumer service. Making sure your always making the customer feel as comfortable as possible while shopping. I learned how to work many different trades while at safe including packaging sliced meat,baking in the bakery department, preparing seafood for customer in the seafood department, loading dairy products in the dairy department and preparing produce customers in the produce department. Management has to be fantastic in safeway in my opinion. The culture in safeway is incredible. Their really isn't a difficulty level when it comes to comparing task in safeway other then management. Working as a team has to be the most enjoyable part of any job."
Safeway,1clk6t8unb890a8a,4.0,"I enjoyed my job, however, we were understaffed for a large department and underpaid for the most part.  Not much room for advancement unless you work there for 5 plus years."
Safeway,1clk1tvhuak8scbv,3.0,"I got to work about 30 minutes early, went up to my locker and put on my apron and settled down until it was time to clock on. Punched on and looked at the sweep and temp logs to make sure they were up to time. Bagged at a check stand and bagged groceries for awhile, checked how many carts there were and went outside when it was less than half full and brought in carts. The checkers are friendly and will help customers find items when I didn't know where they were."
Safeway,1cljs6dpm1bgc1dc,4.0,When I worked there people were always happy. Then we received a new manager and or employees started to leave like wildfire. The new manager was always yelling or down grading you.
Safeway,1cljii5sk1aic0o1,5.0,It was a great place to work.  I worked in several different stores.  They were consistent and the management was very professional and helpful.  I enjoyed going to work.
Safeway,1cljhoh59ak8sdtf,2.0,Cool place to work good money good benifits but the mangement is very bothersome when trying to work also thought about filing harasment charges in produce area manger if you apply stay away from produce area
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1cliokmddak8ra8e,5.0,"Honestly, I have never felt so unwanted and disrespected at any other place of employment. Working here has changed my outlook on large corporations in a drastic way, however, I've learned a lot from my supervisors there that will carry my future careers through years to come. For that, I'm grateful."
Safeway,1cli2d07ebrcv9lq,5.0,"I had a few difficult times while I was at work, although management was great and I learned so much I stood on my feet in one particular spot foe 8 or plus hours and it took a toll on me."
Safeway,1clhqarm4b812ecb,5.0,"This job can be a quick paced or slow paced environment depending what department you work in. Overall, the store requires dedication and great customer service skills in order to progress in the store."
Safeway,1clhl48kub88vbnk,4.0,"Working at Safeway is not a bad route to take as far as employment. The pay and hours are good and the coworkers are cool for the most part. It can get stressful at times especially during holidays or other special occasions but once you receive that paycheck you say to yourself ""eh, it was worth it."" The management was functional although it was quite inconsistent. The hardest part of the job was being able to handle new tasks being thrown at you while also juggling with the tasks you already have, as well as dealing with multiple customers at one time. In addition, you will not always get your lunch time and breaks on time as scheduled. The most enjoyable part I experience with the job was being able to bond and get to know your fellow employees when the day is not as busy. I loved laughing and talking with my coworkers when we are on lunch break or while being on the clock if the store is not that busy as It makes your shift go by a lot faster. On the flip side you will get coworkers who are quick to draw the seniority card to get their way. So, if you are a rookie or new comer at Safeway expect some of the older employees to try and get over you."
Safeway,1clhfhm5s1ahs0uq,3.0,One employee was very rude and always had a mean attitude. No one was allowed to work on her cash register when she was working. Other employees were nice. They cared or asked how your day was or your children.
Safeway,1clh0buv15n8v95o,5.0,"Overall working for Safeway was a fun place to work . All the meat cutters were very helpfull and we did the type of cutting in love to do , we cut meat all day , filled the case , cleaned up then went home"
Safeway,1clgtnms352sva10,4.0,I was the District Shrink Rep for 18 stores in Md and Va. I traveled between stores training assoc. in receiving procedures and freight scheduling. I am trained in each of the grocery depts in ordering and stocking    I worked well with all store managers and assistant managers the workplace was a place where everyone had training and knew their job.  Keeping up with sales associates concerning  out of date product on the sales floor.  Keeping Stores Inventory numbers below 2% shrink.
Safeway,1clg9k6etb88vbun,4.0,"Overall, working for Vons is good. They work well with student schedules but it's difficult to move up unless staying with the company is you're ultimate goal. Customers have different types of personalities, just remember to not express irritation or frustration."
Safeway,1clg4pdesbrcvf11,3.0,work is fun you meet a lot of people I enjoy the environment always try to keep busy fast paced and a great experience overall. I couldn't complain about anything

Safeway,1cld33v93brctd54,3.0,"Fun, friendly work environment. The job is never done. Must be friendly and willing to put the customer first. Open on all holidays. management is always willing to help you succeed."
Safeway,1clcla236b850889,3.0,This job was a good job to gain job skills for a first time worker. The tasks were easy each day but became boring real quick. Most of the employees were good to work with and Management was decent. I was very thankful for this job as it got me through college.
Safeway,1clc23kufbrctc9e,2.0,"Once you get past the Management of the store, the job is amazing and the regular customers are amazing to be around! I really enjoyed gaining the relationships that I did with my regulars."
Safeway,1clban8hub850fq6,5.0,"I honestly really liked working at Safeway my co-workers were sort of like family, just don't get on their bad side. i loved my position as a booth clerk i had room to work it was better than checking all day in a check stand, Management did have their little pets that would go kiss butt or sequel on you for taking 2 minute longer break, I can say Mangement was very fair you scratch my back i'll scratch yours type of deal."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1claqtlo1b88t8ik,3.0,The job was okay. Management wasn't that great. The pay is minimum wage and not enough for everything we do. The hours get cut even with having full time hours for a long time
Safeway,1cladkh3bb84kfpa,4.0,I think the management could have been a little bit better and more relaxed but somewhat stressful in other words. As well with the stress having to know where everything is within a short period of time to further help with the customers wants and needs.
Safeway,1cladgu3vb80keuf,3.0,"Back in the earlier days, health insurance was given after 6 months on the job. In 2012-2013, that changed to working a whole year and only benefits for you and your children, not your spouse. Once you learn the produce codes as a cashier, it makes your job easy to do."
Safeway,1cl9qvglibrcicbv,4.0,just follow the guidelines that the company has you promote pretty fast and they move you departments often. They also have some fun times where we were able to dress up like on Halloween and things like that
Safeway,1cl8hitkgb84kdek,5.0,"Jumping between school and work has always been a bit of challenge, but it never really happened my experiences at Safeway. The average day would consist performing one of two roles I am trained for, checking and being a courtesy clerk. Checking feels the most gratifying, with extensive interaction with the customer base, though longer shifts can make standing in almost one place a little bothesome. As a courtesy clerk, running around to assist customers and make sure the store is in the best shape possible provides some excitement to the daily routine, although at times can be somewhat repetitive."
Safeway,1cl7ndm3t1ahk0vl,5.0,They are really great other than the low pay and meaningless jobs you do day to day. It would be better if you got paid a bit more for all the work that was need to be done.
Safeway,1cl7l9ncob88if85,1.0,Labor budgets are not enough to do a good job.  If you are ok feeling like you didn't do a good job everyday then this is your job.  Upper management is very demeaning when talking to employees.  If they do not do it in your face they will behind your back.
Safeway,1cl7d5oekb88ib3k,2.0,"Applied as courtesy clerk but was recommended Bakery Dept. for good hours as told. But Did not receive good hours in THE FIRST 3 & half weeks worked as bakery clerk..other bakery clerk would go & talk to manager or people, or play w cell phone while i did all the dirty work for them (Most of the work)..worst position ever. I was guaranteed good hours as told by manager but was not satisfied w hours i was given..poor low hours"
Safeway,1cl60pdv952snag6,2.0,i really didn't like working there. The management was terrible.
Safeway,1cl4usf1a5ncnaom,5.0,Working in the Bakery was a lot of stess loaded off on me. Going through a rough time my manager understood that which i brought my 100 percent everyday. No matter if i had to walk 2 hours to get there I worked my hardest and my manager seen that.
Safeway,1cl4mte57brcia25,3.0,"They have working environment and culture. We get to met different people every day. However, there's is a need to improve on customer service and management ."

Safeway,1cl2jrkje1ahk4pj,3.0,day consisted of getting the meat department set up for the day packaging and pushing the product to the floor and customer service. was a good place to work but didn't like the union much
Safeway,1cl2gefm6b80k83f,1.0,You are going to regret it. They disrespect and belittle their staff. The pay is not enough to live off of and the conditions are horrible. THe only saving grace is the discount
Safeway,1cl24gns8brcicft,5.0,Working at safeway was nice cuz the make sure that things are okay and they always checks up on you. They make sure that you get the days you requested off and your imformation private. Customer service was really good.
Safeway,1cl20g04lb80keqa,4.0,"I worked for Safeway for about a year and very much enjoyed my time there. I worked with a great team of cashiers and courtesy clerks, and always had an enjoyable time when I worked there, whether it was bagging groceries, working the check stand, or stocking shelves."
Safeway,1cl1ofl7752snbv4,3.0,during my 90 day probation i was hired because  i had a spider bite that i was seen in the local emergency department where they provided me with documentation to prove i was there and why. the manager at the time named brian reviewed the documents and assured me that everything was ok and on my next scheduled day to work i came in on time and was terminated due to violation of my 90 day probation
Safeway,1cl0vmchhb80kc87,1.0,"Gone are the days of a company with integrity.  I started in the 80's and the culture was...every employee mattered. When a long time employee became seriously ill...we all bonded together and gave up a day or two of our own sick pay to help. That employee could stay out much longer to heal and return to work.  That is loyalty and the return on that investment can be measured by very low turnover, excellence attendance records and working earnestly.  Safeway today is cutthroat  and de-valuing of employees."
Safeway,1ckvut70c52sn953,4.0,"I worked at Safeway as a part time transportation monitor. It was a nice tight knit place to work and they had many long time employees.  The culture ther was such that you go to management, whom you saw daily, with any issue or concern and it was addressed in a manner that left you feeling valued."
Safeway,1ckvo6e9gb88ic03,1.0,"Nearly all employees, unequivocally, hate working there. The management is horrible, unfair and degrading. We all wish to work somewhere else (which is what I'm pursuing now), but most feel stuck. Very little reward for a LOT of work. The union doesn't help either. They vote themselves a raise, and we lose out on a pay increase."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1ckvntpjdbrci8qo,3.0,"Typical work day is pretty busy all day everyday, A good first job but not enough study hours for someone to provide a living. Managemnet will never stand up for the employee"
Safeway,1ckvjpqkubrcidku,4.0,"I would clock in at the time that was designated and perform my job duties, breaks and lunches were scheduled accordingly. They took the time to train all employees so as they could do their job to the best of their abilities. They understood that family was important and did the best that they could to fulfill there requests for time off. The hardest part was the lack of hours that were given in a day to write a schedule for, and being able to make sure that we had enough coverage during all the rush hour of our work day. Even when we had to work holidays we mad it memorable, shifts were cut in half so everyone worked but everyone was also able to be at home with their family for the holiday. We we could a meal for everyone to enjoy throughout the day. No one likes to work the holidays but at least we felt appreciated when we had to."
Safeway,1ckvdd15lak4ne9j,5.0,"Safeway is a professional job they work on a very clean schedule and your fixed to it , bosses are pretty understanding, people just come to buy groceries and leave so your just helping out all day"

Safeway,1cktl6eotb84kbjt,5.0,"During my time at Safeway, I had made many friends and had many great opportunities. I was a shy individual and had grown over time. Starting off as a courtesy clerk was fast paced but relaxed. Talking to the customers most of the time was very fun and laid back. Being in the bakery though was mostly always fast paced but very easy. Although it is very repetitive, the coworkers keep the environment light and friendly."
Safeway,1cktbkg0ubrcid3b,3.0,It was a nice place with really fun and genial people. The work itself was not very amusing. One of the errands you had was to pick the trash and I definitely was not a fan.
Safeway,1ckt9jjhvb80k8n8,3.0,"Flexible hours and fast paced work place. Loved everyone I worked with, but my boss was a bit of a hot-head. Other than that, it is great. The store director is super great and easy to talk to. We have employee meetings throughout the week sometimes and it gives the employees a chance to know how the store is doing and allow the employees to speak up about anything if necessary. Safeway is like a family."
Safeway,1ckt4gfsq5n8ne8f,3.0,I been working with retail since I was 16 and I have a great experience working with people and helping them as well and putting a smile on their faces with great customer service and been getting alone with everyone I work with in the pass years I have work with this company and with management as well and the workplace culture is great working with good employees and treating me with respect

Safeway,1ckrciaglb84ha9i,3.0,"the floral department is not valued enough to pay its employees more than the average produce clerk. If you'd like to sell your soul to the check stands or carnage department to earn a livable wage, than you can. I've fallen in love with floral and I refuse to leave the department and not the company."
Safeway,1ckr6ek6gb80hfr8,4.0,"Front end cashier. I enjoyed the fast pace and the enter action with the customers. I learned how to operate the cash register, how to be a team player. The importance of good work ethics. How to set up and load floor displays. Staying up for the  first few nights on the night shift was difficult.

Safeway,1cklem8pe1aif4u1,4.0,I worked there years ago. It was my first job and they treated me very well. I was young but they taught me good work ethic and it really improved my future.
Safeway,1ckldouqv1d1f5u5,3.0,"The workplace itself was not too bad, but the structure of the store itself was kind of unorganized. Being that this was a store in a low income area, there were a lot of times when staff became overwhelmed."

Safeway,1ckk5dina1fdv19u,1.0,"The mangers at Safeway are the worse mangers I have ever seen. They violate labor laws, they are racist and disguising people. They treated the employees like they were slaves with no rights. That's why they are always hiring because no-one could stay in that environment. The bakery mangers would work you with no breaks for hours. Not a nice place to work."
Safeway,1ckjldq0a1fdv48j,2.0,"High stress, hours scheduled are often changed or not as desired. Too many managers, one often asked one thing from you, while another would grab you and ask you to do something else.

The managers are always willing to help, and are very kind and hard working."
Safeway,1ckihgqfb1d1f272,3.0,I enjoyed my position and the people that I worked with. Our upper management had clear favorites and only advanced people they favored. The managers did not appreciate the people that really deserved it.
Safeway,1ckgovei2b84hftf,4.0,"You can absolutely do well and move up the ranks in Safeway but you need to be focused and keep a positive attitude. Take initiative and if you have a manager that is less than standard, you will need to rise above it, not let it bring you down. This can be hard to accomplish, you must be disciplined. As long as you always operate with honesty and integrity, you will do fine."
Safeway,1ckgfuv621d1f5uj,1.0,It took so long for them to get back to you! You always had to call them to track down the Recruiting person. They need to improve on that. The people they had Hired  their are very poor at there Personality. They can Definitely improve On how they Hire people.

Safeway,1ckblctsr1bab2o3,4.0,"The store manager could have better overall. But the front end managers and assistants were fun to work under and made the job better. The job itself was easy and having holiday pay, overtime, and paid vacation was nice to have."

Safeway,1ckafckog1bgd1f0,2.0,Corporate was horrible.  Always wanted more productivity but would not pay overtime or provide extra employees to produce the desired quota.  Always wanted good surveys from customers when indeed the service was horrible\.
Safeway,1ckabgt1a1d096vv,4.0,If youve ever workes for a corporate grocery store chain they are relatively the same. It's a quick paced and exciting environment. Its a great place to have to job security and benefits.
Safeway,1ck963eb11d0r41r,2.0,"The job is stressful. There's never enough help, the pay isn't high enough for the stress you're under. There's no support, they rarely work with school schedules, and you always hear what you do wrong, but never when you do a great job-like increasing sales 30%."

Safeway,1ck8kgna91d0r74d,3.0,Management was always crazy and stressed. Everything else was fine but you cant fully excel in a job with poor management. I enjoyed my position but didn't enjoy constantly picking up the slack for others and then being expected to do more all the time.
Safeway,1ck8ba2j61ahq134,3.0,This review is based on a company I have not worked for in over 6 years. The life of retail management is many hours and a challenge in the work/life balance.
Safeway,1ck89edh51d1a631,5.0,"Honestly, I wish I had stayed there. There is a lot of room for advancement.  I was young and too immature to realize it.  My co-workers were nice.  I enjoyed helping the customers."

Safeway,1ck37a7vi1d0j0rc,2.0,Management doesn't have a clear direction on what they want. Sets unrealistic expectations on employees. No sense of loyalty to their employees. Very week union that does not show up unless they want union fees.
Safeway,1ck32kbt71d0j55e,5.0,"Its great to work with customers. Ive been able to grow in my stocking experience, and the learning of introduction to produce. A great and friendly place towork for."
Safeway,1ck2t88ti1d144oh,4.0,Safeway allowed me to get a taste of working a job. They hired me when I was 16 years old and it was my first ever job. I learned a lot about providing good customer service as well as being part of a team/reliablilty. As a high school student the part time hours were perfect.
Safeway,1ck2sht7b1d141of,4.0,i learned how to work in a fast pace environment and it was a good place to work while i was in high school. It was a bit under staff so we had to work fast and worked a lot of overtime.
Safeway,1ck2pbu6k1fdj2v0,1.0,"Come work at Safeway if you want to hear the same repetitive horrible 80's soundtrack every shift, while getting paid minimum wage, and your hours change every week, hoping every week that they don't randomly decide to cut hours."
Safeway,1ck1pu51d1d0j3ue,3.0,"I learned that this is a company that could never meet my value as an employee, they underpay their staff, overwork the members that have higher positions, and among other scenarios, are ridiculously cut throat about their methods and procedures."
Safeway,1ck17fmdi1d032ce,3.0,Working at Safeway was a temporary job for me it was a means to make income while I looked for better employment I was only offered a night stocking position and took the job because I had no other options at the time I did not enjoy my schedule (12am-4am/8am) but I worked it anyway for income.
Safeway,1ck13jq2q1agn4pd,4.0,Safeway is a really good company to work for. Competitive wages and excellent benefits. I worked in the Produce area. Facility is very well maintained for ias long as its been there. Management wesn't the best though.
Safeway,1ck0no77a1ahk6a7,3.0,not a bad job over night stocking job. this could be a potential carrier for a lot of people. one thing that would scare people away is the hours. the overnight shift could become overwhelming

Safeway,1cjupn3c41fdj6ur,5.0,"I think that Safeway is a wonderful place to work and meet great people. Everyone is very sophisticated and are very hard workers. I have nothing horrible to say about the people or the company. Except that, I don’t get paid enough or work enough to be able to afford rent and all the appliances I need. I’m stressed out a lot and became very unhappy. I need a new fresh place I know I’ll enjoy working at."
Safeway,1cju9udbj1ba3786,5.0,"Safeway was the second job I had ever had, so I thought it was a really good place to work. The pay wasn't bad at all and if you were full time, you would get health insurance benefits and that kind of stuff. I really like the employee discounts I got. Management is extremely helpful and they would not have you do anything they themselves wouldn't."
Safeway,1cjtve4em1d1408c,4.0,horrible management horrible pay stressful environment difficult to gain promotions and extremely horrendous health benefits still am fighting to have my daughters birth covered by the joke of insurance plan that was offered
Safeway,1cjtrf7g71fdj3ha,2.0,Safeway treats you like slaves in the deli department. no one ever wants to help or even ask if we need help. They look and keep walking on by. Nothing is ever in order or stalked right.
Safeway,1cjtpi3lh0mt75jq,4.0,Working with Safeway Starbucks was a really fun experience for me I loved being a barista it was really slow in the evening time so I was mostly just cleaning and stocking for the next day but when I got rushes I loved the fast pace work.
Safeway,1cjscbvcl1ah50ub,4.0,Great place of work if your going to school it’s a good summer job to make some money during the summer to buy school stuff if you need it or anything

Safeway,1cjrfofd71d0j7ao,3.0,Night Crew has to be trust worthy because you're left in a store with over 75k items and can easily not pay of items. Very little to no
Safeway,1cjr4hq9o1d031m6,4.0,"Working at Safeway is definitely fun. Interacting with customers and fellow co-workers is always fun and engaging. While pushing carts in the middle of summer isn't the best, your always able to get a drink of water at the Starbucks inside."

Safeway,1cjpcbcep1fdj4dg,3.0,"The first 5 years I was with Safeway it was the most amazing place to work and at that time I would have scored it all 5s. Once the old CEO retired and the new one came in, it became all about the bottom line and the care about the employees went out the window."
Safeway,1cjorjl9p1d0j17c,4.0,"The hardest position you can get from Safeway is being a Courtesy Clerk once you've been promoted positions , well in my opinion it gets better. The most enjoyable part is getting payed weekly."
Safeway,1cjomm7k41d146rm,2.0,"You use to be able to advance in the company, but since Safeway switched to Albertsons,  it has all gone down hill. The employees are not happy anymore, stores dont hold the same shine and values, and management definitely has a lot to do with the job."
Safeway,1cjoio8331ai33c6,3.0,"Worked here part-time. It's really hard to get full time hours when you start as a part-time employee. I did not work the best hours. Most of hours were late evening, holidays and weekends, which isn't idela for job work/life balance."
Safeway,1cjohnalj1ai326j,3.0,"There was a culture of favoritism at the store that I worked at. The store manager was Latin, as was the Deli department's manager and assistant manager. They were prejudiced against non-Latins."
Safeway,1cjn98u45b85e9vt,3.0,"Safeway, gives you enough hours, and pay for most people including me, the only thing is they wont work around anything you need to have 24/7 availability so work/life balance isn't a thing"
Safeway,1cjn8a5r8as17d5e,2.0,i liked my fellow department co workers but the head of the operation the main manage meant were very against women and treated us poorly and many did not want to speak up so i left.
Safeway,1cjn0t0tkak989s6,2.0,"This used to be a great job. The pay is worthwhile, but constant staffing issues and a lack of business, along with a severe morale problem in almost every store, makes Safeway a difficult place to work. Management seems like they are not only hostile but also just don’t care to solve issues. I think this permeates to the corporate level as well. After working at various stores for nearly a decade I can say that these issues have just become more and more prevalent. I still would have stayed, because the pay and benefits, as I stated earlier, are well worth it, but I’m not confident the company will remain solvent for the next ten years."
Safeway,1cjmt2nuub899add,4.0,"I really enjoyed working in the bakery. I started as a donut fryer and then moved up from there. I have done all the jobs that need to be done in the bakery.

If you do get a job there, just make sure to not stay too long. I think its a good job for someone in high school/college or as a first job but its not a career!!!"
Safeway,1cjmb7af8b85ebej,3.0,"I understand that it's a retail job, but customers in grocery stores seemed to be the worst. Getting yelled at by customers because ""The customer is always right"" (which is not true at all) and them thinking you have direct control over everything going on the store. Recent management, seemed to not care about the workers and would insult us in front of customers or would ignore our requests. Not only store management, but company management would always expect too much work to get done with little time and help."
Safeway,1cjm5679bbrd9e23,4.0,you knew exactly what your job duties were. They actually train you for the position your hired for. the company encourages you to compete for instore job training in different departments.

Safeway,1cjkq5m0bb85efq1,3.0,"It was fast paced, and competitive but it was also met with a lot of laziness and poor management. Not a lot of opportunities to grow as an employee, and too many expectations to work under different titles with little change in pay."

Safeway,1cjh4tt5cb81fbdi,3.0,"Every day jobs were pilling up on one single person.

I’m now graduated and I went a full year full time 40 hours a week. I went from a regular shelf stocker, to unloading the truck, but now I’m going to be closing the store down by myself as night time manager.

Safeway,1cjf8mpbvb81ffuk,2.0,poor management they look at you as just less then. Cant plan vacations because you are not sure you will get it or if they block that mouth. they favor employees.

Safeway,1cjc5qiuib899e2q,3.0,It was OK working there. But when I went to move out of state they said I couldn't transfer out of state witch was false. Most of the worker were nice. The store was kinda not clean all the time.
Safeway,1cjbtgmh6brd9d9u,4.0,"The management understood my skills and placed me in a position that I would flourish in. The only problem I had was with fellow employees who didn't like my strong work ethic and cheery attitude, and made it difficult work environment."

Safeway,1cj7tnh0taqh2a0l,3.0,"As much as I enjoyed getting to know and shadow experienced food clerks, meeting customers, and learning skills that are relevant to other retail jobs, a few managers in particular from my previous job at Safeway were very unprofessional and impatient when attempting to resolve issues involving other employees. I spoke to 2 different managers about having not been paid for two weeks, and it wasn’t until after I resigned that I was mailed the check for the two weeks’ pay. I wasn’t the only employee who had this problem at this particular location. Overall friendly environment, management just did not seem to be putting effort towards treating employees (food clerks, in particular) with respect. This of course isn’t true for every location, and was really the only issue. Definitely recommend Safeway to anyone looking for an entry level job."
Safeway,1cj7rdq4qb81eeob,3.0,Bakery manager was nice but there are times when he thinks that because he’s a boss he can do what he wants with my schedule last minute. Other than that I enjoyed working as part of the team

Safeway,1cj4kajsnb894chl,2.0,This place sucked the passion right out of my life. I did not like anything about this place at all. I did learn about what kind of job I would not want to work at.
Safeway,1cj4g27a1b818ea1,3.0,"The management needed a serious rain check, tons of people complained to the higher up and was told the issues would be addressed and the were left unattended. in my opinion Safeway lost a lot of respectable people who would've given them a lifetime career working for them; but the didn't listen and address small issues that grew and grew."

Safeway,1cj45j6p4brd4d7m,3.0,"not properly trained. good people to work with on crew, but when a hostile environment occurs it takes forever to get certain management to address the issue. poor follow through with management. especially working on nights, due to the fact that we never get to see management."
Safeway,1cj3273h6ak92cce,3.0,"overall the job was okay, i got moved around alot at the store and never really knew what i was going to do any time i clocked on. normally the managers would drag me around to do their jobs instead of my own because they wanted to sit in the office and talk to eachother instead of their own jobs."
Safeway,1cj2n41to5j4vfmi,4.0,"I started as a Courtesy Clerk in 2014 and moved my way up over the years to a Journeyman Meat Cutter in 2018, so advancement is there if you're willing to work to get there. Since store management is constantly getting switched around, it's hard to give an opinion on ANY specific store, I don't care where you work."
Safeway,1cj2ijh5ibrd4eip,3.0,"fast pace, always running out of supplies, manager had poor inventory stills, scheduling, Favoritism, She kept the bakery Dirty, never set a good example, tons of safety issue"
Safeway,1cj218m2gbrd4duo,3.0,"As a personal shopper I started at 4 am to start picking. The store was mostly empty so that was nice. However, this department prioritized profit so they'd cut hours in order to profit from the service. We were always extremely understaffed and we'd either have to skip out breaks in order to get the orders out on time or let them be late and get asked by management why that was happening. You have to be fast, and rely on your coworkers to be fast. If you have a great squad then you're job will be easy, if you don't you'll hate it."
Safeway,1cj1pncg2b8579tt,5.0,"I enjoyed working at Safeway . Their food selection is top quality always pleasing to the shopper.

Safeway,1cj03p7rlb857afg,3.0,"The job became extremely stressful as a lead or manager. You are not given the help you need to accomplish the tasks that need to be done. For many managers it was a bit defeating. I worked with great people, and my team was awesome."
Safeway,1civdkr2bb818fmr,5.0,Retail
Safeway,1civ1fvhjb818e7o,3.0,I wish the company would provide more hours because getting 24 hours is not enough to survive out here and when supposely we do increase in sales they end of giving more hours to other departments rather then the department that has earn them the sales when most of the time each employee is working by themselves.
Safeway,1civ0fsarb8188m5,2.0,"It's a standard deli. A lot of gossip, not a lot of productivity. Management is fairly laid back as long as what needs to happen gets done on time. Hours can be inconsistent."

Safeway,1cisa70ndak92fjm,4.0,"Working in customer service is a great way to learn how to act as a decent human being. Having to serve others that come in to get their necessary groceries gives you the chance to learn how to handle many different types of personalities and needs. You learn the importance of money and the complexities of our payment system; whether they be cash, credit cards, or ebt. The wide range of positions and jobs available can be daunting, but it also lets you learn what you do and do not like about a specific job or what you are good at."

Safeway,1cilg1ki6b88vdj7,2.0,"Job was very difficult due to poor management, lack of workers and more work than can be accomplished in one shift. Typical day at Safeway consisted of bagging items, returning merchandise and returning carts. Hardest part of the day was bagging items with only one bagger during busy hours. Most enjoyable part is talking to customers and meeting new people."
Safeway,1cikthb9jak8sb2d,2.0,"I worked for Safeway for about two years and I started at the bottom of the food change. I worked extremely hard to go from a CC to the Head Cake Decorator...I even went to college for this job! They fought me day and night over a raise - wanted to keep me at an APC rate instead of a Decorator. They cut hours and then complain when things don't get done. I even had my store manager tell me to just work off the clock because he wouldn't get his bonus if we stayed clocked in. EXAMPLE: I was in the bakery...because of that manager and our store manager, they had counting myself, EIGHT people quit on spot. I will never shop there again!!!"
Safeway,1cikmsuq9b88var3,2.0,Day working at Safeway deli looks like walking into the deli with not enough employees to help with costumers. When there is enough coworkers most are hiding in the back or trying to do what ever else to not help the costumers. When talking to management they put blame on one another without fixing the problem.

Safeway,1ciia9ljdb852897,5.0,"I worked at VONS for about four years. My days were very much the same. I would bag groceries, check the aisles for spills and bring in shopping carts from the parking lot. Occasionally they would have me doing something else such as cleaning certain displays. During the closing shift I would bring more plastic bags up from the back and take out the trash. The hardest part was working holiday shifts because those were the busiest times however those were also the most enjoyable days as well."
Safeway,1ciia1ml8brcva5h,3.0,Would still work there if didnt need to relocate. It was a good work environment and really liked working fir the bakery manager and coworkers. Did not like the store director.

Safeway,1cigf9gkab88vc3i,3.0,I've been working for the company for almost 6 years and the store i work at just continues to get worse and worse when it comes to hours.

Safeway,1cibgf55kbrcvdlf,3.0,Typical day is stress full.  Scheduling is whack.  Department manager unable to set an example. Customers are nice.  Hardest part was remaining optimistic.
Safeway,1cibcoo22aqgpdtp,3.0,"My experience working for the Safeway company was, in itself, just fine. I did have some issues learning the skills at first but many of my co-workers were willing to assist me to get the order right and to make sure the customer was satisfied. However, I was not told of some complaints made about me; nor was I given a chance to rectify said complaints through my own actions."

Safeway,1cialm333b8138fo,2.0,I liked it was close to home. the only down fall to the Guerneville store was the manager she didn't know what she was doing and she would promise you a job in the store but never follow through. she played a lot of mind games for my taste. She told me I was hired at 12.50 an hours and got paid 10.10 an hour. I complained but she always had a excuse n blamed corporate. I called corporate and talk to a lady in HR n she never did anything about it. she said she would call manager but it seemed like the way she talked her and manager were friends so I knew it wasn't going anywhere.  I was there everyday on time and worked. I learnt all area of the different departments and told me by manager that I would become a night manager she needed one and that never came about so I got tired of it all the lies so I quit not knowing that she would quit about a few months later. if I had an idea she would quit I would of stuck it out.

Safeway,1ci5pams4brcsa9e,3.0,"Overall, I would consider my time at Safeway to be a positive experience. Being my first job, pretty much everything was a learning experience. My duties included working the register, cleaning the store, returning product in the proper location, crushing of boxes and garbage, and stocking. They had me doing various duties, but I was primarily working the cash register. In terms of management, I would consider them good. I've made mistakes, including one or two ones I consider pretty serious, and yet, I was able to keep my job for how long as I did. Managers and people in charge were cool enough. I made some friends among my coworkers, but for the most part, you won't get to know many of them considering all the separate departments and people working within them.  Work environment, whether it be stressful and quick-paced or relaxing and peaceful, varies depending on the day and time you're scheduled to work."
Safeway,1ci5kakldb88se50,2.0,Not a very fun job. iI had no training and hardly anyone showed me how to do basic job functions. I was forced to learn for myself how to do my job and there wasn't much of a team oriented environment.

Safeway,1chudp43t5ncm9rg,3.0,"Busy on and off, but it might be stressful if you often work alone especially during happy hour. First week of hands-on training was a bit overwhelming, but most coworkers were nice and would always answer questions. Closing shifts were sometimes a bit difficult, but manageable.

Safeway,1chor5t4h5n8ld84,3.0,"It is a regular day on the go. Starting with a beautiful open heart,  smile and GM , checking  the hygiene and the outlook of the team and the workplace then making a plan for each coworker after doing the inventory and checking the floor and outside tables. Ordering after checking the freezers and the cabinets, checking the emails and the schedule, going on conference calls, checking the sales and the distress and trying to make some improvements, always watch the quality and communicate with the team... Help each coworker to finish their goal.... And fill up the tables because our goal is the customer and we need to make it satisfied and happy. The hardest part of the job is that you have a lot to do and you do not have the help needed and your manager is never happy!!!!  Some managers can't manage their stress so they think if they take it out on you they will be fine because they know nothing about leadership skills. Working with a team is for a certain part of time, but it is an experience that you will keep  in your heart for a lifetime and each and every member of this team is like a family member that stay in your heart and memories till the end of time. And the workplace memories never fade with all the struggling it's like home. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and the feedback and surveys that they spend time to do it for you and when they call and are thankful about the products and the team members ! So you are proud of your team and this is the best feeling ever !"
Safeway,1choh9as3b88oble,4.0,"It was my first job and I worked there 2 yrs through out high school. The job was very good, people friendly, management was knowledgeable and environment cleaning."
Safeway,1chlgpohrak8mc2s,3.0,"A day of work at Safeway (Deli)  is very stressful. It has only 1 personnel to do all the tasks like customer service, cashiering, taking orders, sometimes making sandwiches (because the one whose in-charge is on lunch break)  cutting of meats. It's like multi-tasking. On the positive note, I learned a lot. Management is just fair.  The workplace is good and work force is multi-culture. My hardest part of the job is the cutting of meat for customers.  My most enjoyable part is taking orders from customers and cashiering."

Management was very communicative and your expectations are clearly stated. It is a very straightforward job."
Safeway,1chh8bohaakggdia,2.0,"Lazy union workers didn't want to move up but didn't want anyone else to either.  They filed a grievance when I, after less than 3 months of working there became the Back Door Receiving Clerk and Bookkeeper.  They did the same thing to my husband (we were hired at the same time) when he became the Deli Manager.   The Store Manager and the Assistant Store Manager were wonderful!  As management they cannot be part of the union and couldn't really do anything about employee behavior without going through the union first.  Unions were and still are good for somethings but, in my opinion, the UFSWC breeds lazy employees and created way too much drama for my liking."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1chgrf73kb84nced,4.0,"While walking to the break room to clock on before the start of my shift I never had a complete idea of what I was going to be doing for the day. While I knew I would likely be bagging, cleaning, gathering carts, or taking out the garbage for a few hours of the day there was always something unpredictable. Once clocked in it is important to know that even though you are assigned a task for that certain hour chances are you will be taking on more than that task. Anyone can succeed at Safeway if they are able to accept that and work as a team."
Safeway,1chgoucbobrcl9hr,4.0,it was fun when i was working there but unless i was kissing my managers feet then there was no way i was getting a career advancement. i did learn alot about costumer service.

Safeway,1ch71rk3mb80ieir,3.0,"I believe working at Safeway is what you make of it. I had ups and downs working at Safeway and found I was happiest working there when I threw myself into my work.

Safeway,1ch6v2ur2b84hes3,1.0,"I needed a job and Safeway hired me, however the management at the time wasn't the greatest. Their idea of training wasn't great, and if you worked nights they didn't train you. However, some of the members did end up working with were great."

Safeway,1ch6n72t91agv5bd,3.0,"Safeway was hard for me; it was the best job I've had as of yet, but was pretty odd with its hours. Moreover, there seemed to be some lack of communication with the management, since I was asked to work on a free day a few days beforehand, yet I was still called in regardless. Moreover, as good as the management was, I found it to be pretty absent at times or even make plain odd decisions at times. Plus, the times when I would have to run around at different jobs on busy days made it hard for me to be effective anywhere."
Safeway,1ch6jv5tnb84he87,4.0,This job was very easy if you are quick. Its pretty simple and they do not have you do too much beside scan groceries. If you do well and are a quick learner you can advance and get paid up to $20 to do other jobs
Safeway,1ch6jtgc81agv54t,5.0,"Although I enjoyed working here, I did not feel that they promote from within. During my time there, they were quick to hire from outside before looking at the quality employees looking to step up."

Safeway,1ch4ri5nj1fdv6hh,3.0,"I was desperate for a job when they threw me a life line 2 years ago, but now they take more from me emotionally, mentally, and physically than they give back to me in terms of financial security. I'm definitely at the end of my line for this line of work, and I don't see the negative work environment around there improving due to corporate meddling."
Safeway,1ch4pvp60b84hd73,5.0,you will always be on your feet cooking and cleaning you get paid every week and amazing co-workers to help you when you need something the managers are very understanding
Safeway,1ch4g2rkg1fdv0vb,3.0,"Safeway was not an enjoyable company to work for. I was trained for many areas and performed in all of them without ever getting a pay raise and though they could have had me full time they would intentionally schedule me for less than full time so that I could not receive full time benefits. It is very difficult to get a raise--it is a company that makes it feel like hard work does not pay off.  In order to be ""promoted"" to cashier I had to pay a massive fee that was the same amount as my weekly pay--and it did not result in a raise."
Safeway,1ch4338331d1f5u8,5.0,I loved working at safeway they molded me into the work horse I am. A nice environment for anyone to accel in the company. Very negotiable on hours and paid time off.
Safeway,1ch42l1lhb84h9h4,2.0,The managers would not give anybody 40 hours a week.  If you were hired on a cashier and they needed somebody in a different department they would put cashiers in other departments with no training.  They would not put enough cashiers on and were always calling people from other departments to fill in as cashiers off and on throughout the whole day.
Safeway,1ch3miqf50mcu7fm,1.0,store managers are the worst and don't care for their employees the ones that they get a bonus off of . They are the real meaning of a p.o.s!! They love to hold your job over your head so their isn't any job security in this company.
Safeway,1ch20lv3b1fdv6ek,2.0,Worked hard here for two years only to be shot down by new managers. Very tedious every stressful I’d rather drive cars all day. I did most of the supervisors job as well as mine the entire time working there. Being a cashier on top of handeling upset customers.
Safeway,1ch1mrhu0b80ifiq,3.0,"I really like the people I worked with at Safeway. Frankly, it is probably the reason I stayed there as long as I did. Upper management and the corporation as a whole as so much of their collective heads up their collective a**es that it makes the job stupid and almost undoable."

Safeway,1cgvdna63b80ia5v,3.0,"Having to pay union dues and not having any representation.Low wages, and no benefits unless you work a constant 40 hours.

I believe if stayed and didn't move, I would have had lots of opportunities."
Safeway,1cgscc92d1d0a4iv,3.0,Fellow employees were wonderful to work with but there was a bit of favoritism within the store and with district management. Also bakery district manager assistant was never truly helpful to the store I worked in...always focused on the other stores in the district
Safeway,1cgs462gg1d1c0jm,1.0,"It is tough to work in a place where company culture requires coworkers to report every transgression to your manager.

Safeway,1cgfhio7i1bg23vl,2.0,"A typicial work day at safeway involved, checking out customers, pushing carts, attending to customers needs, cleaning the store along with the parking lot, and putting back unwanted groceries. I learned how to cashier, how to demo products, how other departments work, how to interact with different people, how to clean up messes and other things properly, and how to use teamwork to efficiently run a store. The management wasn't the best. The store manager was very unprofessional and more often than not practiced nepotism but other than that the other managers were very professional and very efficient in their jobs. Working at safeway I met people of every background. My co workers were friendly for the most part and were respectful. The hardest part of working their was having to deal with the inefficiency of some co-workers. The most enjoyable part was getting to know all types or people and being able to help others."
Safeway,1cgfhev1h1d137jf,3.0,Day to day operations were fairly consistent. Management always were looking for something to complain about. Department hours rarely increased for busy holidays. Store management rarely provided support to departments that were struggling and was very stressful on corporate walk-through's. Having the right team made it bearable
Safeway,1cgff4na31fdm19d,4.0,"Ordering, stocking, merchandising. Liked the different kinds of jobs to do.  DM never seemed to be happy.  Loved working with community.  Most coworkers are happy."
Safeway,1cgfd2v541d130ta,4.0,Wonderful work environment  with positive co workers. Typical day day work was being responsible for resets. I worked on my own making sure all new products were in place at the right time paying attention to product placement. The culture of Aisle One was one of consistency. The hardest part of the job was being accountable for product placement and the company. I enjoyed the responsibility it required.
Safeway,1cgfd1s3e1d137qp,4.0,its a good place to work and they hire good people everyone is very polite and helpful really no complaints I wish I could still work there today the pay was good the work was easy and the managers were great

Safeway,1cgf3ofpb1d134d8,3.0,"Working under Safeway was a great first job, and taught me how to use my time wisely, and how to socialize with the public. Although I wasn't always given a great number of hours, the way the store handheld and cared for my school schedule was very much appreciated."
Safeway,1cgdnm3b21d0i0ar,2.0,Standing for over 8 hours a day with a 15 minute break. Not able to call out for any emergencies unless you go to the doctors and get a note. Very quick pace job.
Safeway,1cgd9i8hf1fdm7qb,4.0,"I held various positions during my tenure at Safeway! I had eventual hopes in securing better compensation, but that become a moot point when I started to inquire."
Safeway,1cgcg3nv21d053tu,4.0,"Safeway has a fairly decent training program. Being union you are taken care of with benefits, pay raises and promotions within. Every department has a manager which i had no problem with. Only downfall i had with this company was a asst store manager."
Safeway,1cgb9es971ba10vu,2.0,"One of the worst places I've ever worked at. Pay is bad and management is even worse. They expect you to bow down and kiss their feet all the time. Dont make personal plans because you will be expected to work. Not allowed to ask for days off because you will not be accepted. Do not ask for vacation because thats not allowed. If you work at Safeway, that'll be your life for now on. No more personal life. Always work."
Safeway,1cgb76nptbrcjcj6,3.0,"Typical an average day working at Safeway is pretty repetitive with exceptions.  when upper management comes in everybody gets stressed for no reason. they are always going to say something negative, but sometimes they do say something positive"
Safeway,1cgag68k7brcjcku,3.0,"Most difficult art of this job was, working with fellow employees who don't care about their job. Mostly teens working. Management was helpful. Pay was minimum wage with little chance of raise. Most enjoyable par of working as serving and helping customers."
Safeway,1cgae6rcqak4kbfu,3.0,"Really only depends on the location and who you work with, some Safeway were complete garbage and some were great but really I was only there to do my job and go home. A couple stores I worked for switched store managers like 4 times in a 2 year period. How does that help anyone?"
Safeway,1cgad1rrnb84ldur,1.0,"They are so desperate for staff and I can see why, they're manager is absolutely rude and lacks communication skills. She offered an interview time that I unfortunately could't make and coped an attitude stating this is an interview, so its important right? If you can treat a potential hire like that i pity the employees."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1cga98locak4kf4d,3.0,"Just like any other grocery store job. You cash people out, you bag groceries, gather carts, clean up messes, and stock things here and there. It was pretty simple other than the management at the time. The management has changed since then."
Safeway,1cga0ln8obrcjf3t,3.0,It's fast paced at the bakery department at Vons.  Most co-workers are nice.  You have to be on time at 5 am in order to get the job done otherwise you get behind in your duties.
Safeway,1cga0et79akcia18,5.0,"Good place to work, the mangers were nice and everyone was a team. When someone needed help, everyone tried to pitch in and help that person. It was like a family"
Safeway,1cg9sidktb80l91k,5.0,"Safeway management was supportive of you and worked with you. I did learn good work ethics there. My experience at Safeway was very enjoyable. If I didn’t have to relocate/ move I would still be working at Safeway, very good company to work for."
Safeway,1cg9ppbkpakcibkn,2.0,The work life balance is off.
Safeway,1cg8bnc7l52skd58,4.0,I had a great manage who saw my potential and gave me opportunity for greater responsibility. The Safeway I worked at was in a college town so many of my coworkers were my age and make work enjoyable.
Safeway,1cg7oqc1hb80laf6,5.0,"Went to work at Safeway, started stocking shelves."
Safeway,1cg7dl641b80lak4,3.0,I feel that the Culture at Safeway was not a good one. You were forced to sign papers without reading them. No training after initial training and there was to much employees telling management what to do.
Safeway,1cg73e4b6b88j8ml,3.0,"My time at Safeway as been nothing but good. The coworkers are hardworking and outgoing. Everyone tries to keep an uplifted spirit when at work , even if we may not want to be there ,or there’s been a situation in which it would disrupt the positive energy going around."
Safeway,1cg7271p3ak4ke74,4.0,"I worked a nights, so usually it was very calm chill. Had work with a good team of people. Stocking and unloading freight wasn’t hard at all. Very good team building job"

Safeway,1cg5ub4qhb80laeh,1.0,The deli department lack organization.  Did not have enough clerks to handle customers requests or orders.  As a deli clerk you are also required to mop/scrub the floor and wash enormous trays.
Safeway,1cg50a5l5b88jee1,3.0,i was part time and this was a second job. prefer not to answer any other questions because i feel my opinion may be biased based on the fact the company wouldnt grant me enough hours to sustain myself
Safeway,1cg441t27b80la2e,4.0,Had an amazing boss which ended up teaching me a lot. Learned how to heard and deep Frye chicken. How to put party trays together. How to do inventory for the deli
Safeway,1cg37ne52b80lfng,1.0,"I was hired at Safeway in my junior year of high school and worked there for a little over a year. Over that year, I was promised multiple raises and promotions because I had a work ethic unlike my coworkers, which made the store function smoothly. What I received were empty promises with countless pushbacks and picking up more slack from other people who would abuse your productivity. I was actually medically advised to quit because at age 18, I was diagnosed with severe tendonitis (which could have easily led to carpal tunnel syndrome), acute chest pains, and was drastically underweight (125 lbs at 5'10""). It was a terrible experience and I would never recommend working for Safeway."
Safeway,1cg36mavlbrcjd9c,5.0,I joined Safeway as a part time. Later on I applied in corporate office. Safeway is very fair to the employees and a workplace culture. The most enjoyable part of my job is traveling from one store to another store and so audits.  I learned a lot about time management and dealing with different type of customers. I  fully enhanced my customer service experience.
Safeway,1cg2ngdbjbrcjet9,3.0,"I like working at safeway for the customer service aspect of the job.

Safeway,1cg2egfj4b80lf2c,4.0,The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with customers and helping them find what they are looking for. Management was great and I was able to get promoted two times to different departments of the store.
Safeway,1cg0qq6j6brcj8nk,3.0,Travelling was well paid at the time I worked there. But submitting information for reimbursement was a big hassle.
Safeway,1cg0a8a5hb80lfng,5.0,Safeway has superior customer service. Strong communication and professionalism to maintain an effective work environment for all employees. Flexible scheduling and competitive pay.

Safeway,1cg04unuab84la6s,3.0,Deli work was stressful most days as you had a few cases to jump between and not enough time. Some customers were really rude and management would almost never regulate; the customer is always right.
Safeway,1cfvtu3q6brcj80e,5.0,Laid back management and hours are easy to change. Stock fruit and vegetable. Remove any that you considered bad. Keeping the produce department clean and organized. Help customers locate items and information on the prices.
Safeway,1cfvivkl85n8mdc3,4.0,"Safeway is a great company to work for because  they give you benefits , discounts , and 401 k, and the people are great there . i learned how to bag groceries properly. but a typical day at work at Safeway as a courtesy clerk was very busy , bagging peoples groceries, receiving carts from outside , cleaning the bathroom , and taking back food items people did not want ,"
Safeway,1cfu4tfv8b80he9k,4.0,"My job was to service any customers that required help in bagging groceries, assistance carrying groceries to their car, keep check stands, floors, and bathrooms clean, as well as keep up any spills. I learned a lot of experience in customer service to keeping customers happy and how to deal with upset customers to attend to their needs so that they are satisfied. The hardest part was making sure fellow courtesy clerks communicated with each other to getting tasks done because we are constantly racing around the stores so we need to keep track where everyone is."
Safeway,1cftuoe520mtv4l8,2.0,Management has no clue what it supervisors or workers are capable of because they do not ask and they don't listen when informed.  New management would benefit the company greatly.
Safeway,1cftq8not1aie53f,4.0,Good luck getting hours you've requested or that raise you've requested because you will be waiting for months to see a change. Management is unorganized and cares more about the business itself rather than the employees that help the store succeed.
Safeway,1cfto2oj81d1f0s3,4.0,A lot of my managers were very good people and I enjoyed working with but have a problem with my 2nd assistant manager for both my stores.
Safeway,1cftl1fp3b80hc15,4.0,"everything is face paced especially for a courtesy clerk. However some days are slow, nut manageable. the managers are understanding. employees are good sometimes have their good and bad days but doesn't let it affect the work space."
Safeway,1cftbku7f1fdv7lj,4.0,I had a lot of job titles at this location and learned a lot of things there. Management was good to us and we worked hard. We had a lot of promotions and different contests that made the store a fun place to come to work. The pay was good and we had fun.
Safeway,1cft9uu0m5n8ibme,5.0,I work in the Bakery as a Bakery Clerk. Management is easy to talk to and bring issues to get resolved quickly. The hardest part of the job is getting everything done in a short amount of time because there is so much to do. The easiest part is serving customers.
Safeway,1cft4nv7v1aie411,4.0,They were a good company to work for at the time but since they have come back under the Albertsons umbrella as Randall's I have nothing recent to compare them to.
Safeway,1cft2v9eg1ahf6t0,2.0,"Clientele is easy to manage with a positive and patient attitude. Unfortunately management is not reliable at most levels. Inconsistent compensation, lack of understanding of customer needs, etc. Also the building itself has issues with keeping shelves full, a malfunctioning restroom, and the backroom is often left cluttered which poses a fire hazard."
Safeway,1cfsuntlsb80hdk7,3.0,"It's a good place to work for people with out much experience. They do train in store for most positions. Fairly flexible hours. It is a union job for most positions, which means paid holiday pay of some kind."
Safeway,1cfsaik121fdv76m,4.0,"I came to work, never missed a day of work. Performed my job to best of my ability every day. Helped others that needed help. Assisted with daily orders/purchasing and inventory. Kept my section in tip-top shape, and got better each day."
Safeway,1cfrpovam1fdv7lk,3.0,This is a great job for beginning to enter the work force and for people that like to be on their feet.  They are open from 6 am to 11 pm 7 days a week and operational 365 days a year.  The pace of the job directly correlates with the customers that come in on that particular day and what they buy.  Sales affect hours and if sales are down then hours get cut
Safeway,1cfrhdjqlb84heps,5.0,"From day one i felt welcome, management is VERY understanding and with work with you to accommodate your schedule needs lots of smiles throughout all the employees! it was like one big family loved it there!!!"
Safeway,1cfrenmnu1bgf0ps,1.0,"It was a very boring job. You would think that with t being boring that it would be ok, but it is so dead that it isn't even fun. Would not recommend anyone works here unless you are desperate."
Safeway,1cfr1o88s1bae629,5.0,"Even though it was a high school job Safeway was my best job so far. Management was fair and approachable and I got perks such as discounts and days off, especially when I provided enough notice to management."
Safeway,1cfr0a9g51ahf4eh,2.0,"minimum wage, the management was bad and the employees were never working. Manager would not change my hours, would get mad when someone calls in sick and tells them they might get fired"

Safeway,1cfqorqm11d1f433,3.0,"The best part about being a personal shopper is filling the early mornings with something to do.  I personally like how the position is all customer based meaning depending on how many customers place their orders for that day. As shoppers, our hourly pay is based on how fast and accurate we can fill the orders."
Safeway,1cfqle4ov1bae5d8,5.0,Fun environment friendly customers staff is great. No overtime or benefits. I enjoyed working there just needed more hours. Apply if u are interested super easy hiring process
Safeway,1cfqft4oo0kbv37u,1.0,Not even worth having it be your first job. There are plenty of other nice grocery stores to work at compared to here. Would not recommend to anyone at all.
Safeway,1cfqahufab84helk,5.0,As a checker I enjoyed working with customers. Its a pretty easy going job unless it's a holiday. When it was busy management really stepped up to help the store. Coworkers were really fun to work with. We got raises after so many hours which was nice.
Safeway,1cfp9kts21d122h2,5.0,"The workers are tenured and the job culture is similar to a family.  A typical day at work can be best described as ""busy"". You learn alot about the different ways people communicate. There is so much going on in a day, if you proactively engage with the work, you will become a customer service beast. Management varied by the store manager's approach, my management staff was phenomenal with creating a great atmosphere that made you want to go to work. The hardest part of the job is to consistently work at a high level without burning out, you got to pace yourself. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the workers and growing with the store community."
Safeway,1cfov8ilp1fdj17f,4.0,"a typical day at work consisted of merchandising, stocking and helping customers, i learned alot about different types of produce and why theyre good for you. the hardest part of the job was the cleaning of the coolers. the most enjoyable part was being able to assist customers"
Safeway,1cfoq8j0a1d1243o,4.0,Safeway strives to bring the best customer service by accommodating and making sure there customers are taken care of. They maintain a good staff and are very reasonable with meeting the needs of the company but there employees too.
Safeway,1cfoijgb51d026p9,1.0,"After only a short period of time working at Safeway, it became clear that harassment was something that happened everyday with everyone. Fellow cashiers came in crying during my training period. They said that harassment was normal and they just had to deal with it by crying in the break room. I quit soon after."
Safeway,1cfofd0h01fdj46d,4.0,"Great job for young people, requires a lot of physical work, different type of schedules, you learn a lot about retail and get to interact with different kinds of people. Great opportunity to learn."
Safeway,1cfo4buns1d0h1mk,3.0,"Overall, my experience at Safeway was great in the way it taught me so many skills. The hardest part was standing the whole day/shift, and also the fast pace of rush hour, and sometimes the bad customers."

Safeway,1cfjum78o1fdj0c8,3.0,I am currently a Produce Clerk and a typical day at work includes starting at 5am in the morning and working my department.  I work on setting up the front table with fruits and vegetables.  That is pretty much all I do besides of course helping customers and making them feel welcome while shopping at Safeway.

Safeway,1cfj6r1qr1d0h3h6,5.0,"I moved with a leave of absence and transfer to store near my new home and was not accepted with my transfer.  It has been months with no work available and being told they will not hire accept my transfer.  We are not hiring transfers.  I am being denied unemployment due to the fact I am still working, but was told that I quit.  According to the work phone and hr department, I am active on leave.  I was disqualified from unemployment and now on appeal.  I have been struggling to pay bills and put food on my family table or get gas to look for work."
Safeway,1cfj3m5hh1fdj0ju,4.0,"If working with the general public is not for you then I don't suggest this job. There are opportunities for career advancement and great benefits and raises for those who are promoted. Fun environment depending on management. However, schedules are not set and change often."
Safeway,1cfijm3091d122r4,3.0,if you like working with people it is fine but they will drive you crazy and your manager could change at any time. if you have a good or bad manager is a roll of the dice.
Safeway,1cfhmmvcb1d1278f,4.0,"A typical day at work consisted of an early start with a consistent workflow throughout the day. I learned to work hard and work well, as the work I did greatly affected how the store would be judged by the health inspector. The management was wonderful. They worked with me and my schedule and never over scheduled me, as they were very understanding that I was a college student on his first summer off of school. The workplace culture wasn't the best, but there were a few coworkers that made work a little bit better each day. The hardest part of the job would have to be getting down on my hands and knees to clean the drains if they ever got clogged, and the most enjoyable part would have to be the fact that I was able to converse with my coworkers as I worked."
Safeway,1cfhe5p9h1d124dp,2.0,"I enjoyed getting to know my coworkers and customers. Unfortunately this company only focuses on money and not the value of customers and staff. Safeway is all about sell sell sell, cutting hours, and do-what-I-say attitude."
Safeway,1cfgg0ca51d025ra,2.0,It sucked. Plain and simple. Customers were rude.  The management was incompetent.  High turnover rate. Most employees didn't last more than six months.
Safeway,1cfg6rj4u1d024uc,3.0,The store I worked at was horrible
Safeway,1cfej0hru1fdj6ac,4.0,This was a really great experience working here. I not only advanced quickly but I made great friends.  Mostly of the people st Safeway’s are friendly and helpful. Great people.
Safeway,1cfe7tbd61d124kh,4.0,This is a good first time job to get. The management was flexible with my college schedule. The job is simple but it can be stressful at times. The pay and benefits are pretty much nothing and there is virtually no opportunity for advancement. Expect hours to range for morning to night time with some of these shifts frequently back to back.
Safeway,1cfe0r26k1d0h5vr,4.0,"This fast paced environment was nice because it makes you feel more busy. As a cashier, downtime makes the time pass by so much slower! So I really enjoyed being at such a quick paced location."
Safeway,1cfdleikd1bg22g3,1.0,"at a non union store they will work you for 60 hrs a week then drop you to 10 hrs  a week for no reason , they will call you in and work you for a few hrs a day every day for months at a time. They refuse to let you get a second job and expect you to live on 10-15 hrs a week, pushing you to do more than is humanly possible without killing yourself in the proscess"

Safeway,1cfbs1p55brdid69,3.0,The way shifts are set up in the deli makes it so teamwork to complete tasks is basically impossible. It's just bad management. Fast paced. Only a 10% discount and you have to sign up a certain way online.

Safeway,1cfb501sub81rbbe,1.0,Safeway as a company does not seem interested in providing a good experience for its customers or its employees. The work place is stressful and lacks organization.
Safeway,1cfb37uraas1ccfi,5.0,Nice company also able to pick up more hours if needed and would be able to talk to management to see if you can get more hours in other departments they can always use the extra help.
Safeway,1cfb2vtcabrdid2s,4.0,As long as you can work fast and well there's absolutely no reason you wont succeed at Safeway.  It may be physically strenuous but it's worth it for the pay and benefits.

Safeway,1cf8s1kn6b85v861,3.0,long lines and not enough help to keep lines moving. co-workers were friendly. I was paid less than 9.20 and i worked there for two years. The Union stuff were a pain.
Safeway,1cf78ou4k5n9faii,2.0,"I've been working at Safeway part-time as a cashier for almost a year. Its a job for a high school or college student. The pay is nothing to write home about and but the hours are ok. depending on your work environment and if co-worker are friendly it's not that bad. I average around 23 hours a week and by the end of that week I earn between 150$ - 200$  not the best but it's something. As a college student I'm not interested in benefits nor am I interested in making this a career. If your looking to make a decent amount of money, I would recommend you look elsewhere."

Safeway,1cf6f6ejmb89eeam,1.0,"This is a fairly easy place to work and anyone can do the work. Generally flexible hours, you start at minimum wage and get raises based on the number of hours worked total, not how well you do your job. If you are doing a bad job, they dont tell you, they just give you less hours and move you to a department that no one likes."
Safeway,1cf6au6pqbrd9ftb,2.0,"My experience working for the company was adequate for the job itself. Most of the coworkers provided a pleasant experience, and made the job environment pleasant."
Safeway,1cf64t9ghak5591t,3.0,"Safeway is a store in which you have the opportunity to explore what you may be good at, whether it be baking or meat cutting or front end cashing. I appreciate the training they provide."
Safeway,1cf61se0fb81gatp,3.0,My first job while in high school. It paid well enough and my hours were just enough so that I had time for school. I liked my coworkers well enough but there was some internal issues with management.
Safeway,1cf5u028bbrd9b5r,4.0,"It's good work environment and as long as you do your work effecientialy and productively, management pretty much leaves you alone to do your job.  Would recommend it"
Safeway,1cf4fksrcbrd988b,3.0,The management is uncannily lax.
Safeway,1cf4846fkbrd9cj9,3.0,There was drama among co-workers but it was over all a decent place to work. The benefits were good and the hours were too. The work wasn't too hard but we still had plenty to do on shift.
Safeway,1cf43h19tbrd98t0,4.0,"The job itself was fine, the manager was great, too. But, due to other employees being inconsistent with arrival time it made my life a lot harder as there had to be a lot of rescheduling throughout the week."
Safeway,1cf3o9rlhbrd9frb,3.0,"The Baker position would be fine if I wasn't paid minimum wage, there are plenty of minimum wage jobs out there that require far less effort. You wake up at 2AM most days to go in at 3AM, and you will most certainly be working 8 hour shifts."
Safeway,1cf1uknkpb85j8t0,4.0,"A typical day at work: checking, put frozen back to fridge,"
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1cf1nv07bb89eaom,4.0,a typical day is 8 hrs of standing lift and brewing all manner of coffees. it's not hard just a lot of memorization. expect to clean all day and things get messy that's just how it goes
Safeway,1cf1krpqs52t5fnh,3.0,"It was a nice experience working there. I recommended to everyone who wants's to have a job in the city. We can bid on shifts but then again so are several other employees. They always have jobs, paid on time weekly, always had my hours correct, friendly, and tries to help look for something i am interested in, make sure that the employer is treating us right"
Safeway,1cf16pp08b89ee8g,2.0,"Management was horrible dispatch was horrible ,    Very on organized and I never felt like they even cared about me .  They would never give me enough hours to pay my bills it was impossible dispatch would call you off at least once a week and sometimes I would only have like four deliveries to make if I could a got 40 hours out of them I would’ve been happy because the job was basically easy just not enough hours management was terrible and they just don’t really care about you"
Safeway,1cev2f4krbrd9d0k,4.0,"Working for Safeway, it was a good job but the pay was bad, the cashiers were often rude to other coworkers and the store was insanely stressful during holidays. Management is decent but it has absolutely no interest in building professional relationships with its employees."
Safeway,1cev292bmb81gdvt,4.0,Well first of my review on this job is that it looks fun but its a lot of work. I would like to work as Barista/Cashier because I like the customer service and how they help out the customers.
Safeway,1ceuokcfrb89ecuq,4.0,I work in a rather small department (30 people or so). Family type setting. I was able to transfer to this department from another which was a great move for me.
Safeway,1ceueu4d3ak97bm9,4.0,Going and gathering the carts from the parking lot to bring back to the entrance for customer use. Customer service by bagging groceries and helping them out to their cars.
Safeway,1ceu8pm20akd4clj,3.0,"During my time at Safeway I thought I preformed very well, as a cashier it is a goal to be very customer friendly and consistent. I was both of these, still I never got over 20 hours a week. Sometimes, I would just get as little as 4 hours a week, if any. I just wish I could've worked more hours before I had to leave."
Safeway,1cet4u572b85jcr9,3.0,"A typical day would be pushing carts, clocking sweeps, bagging groceries and cleaning up messes. I learned to manage my time very well due to having to crunch in two sweeps an hour and also learned to be strategic with having only an hour to get all the carts from the parking lot. Management could've been a lot better, they kind of threw me into my position with little training or explanation on job duties and got mad when I did something wrong that I never learned how to do properly. Employees were very diverse and helpful when I had questions. Hardest part of the job was pushing carts as pushing eight at once gets really heavy. Most enjoyable part was the health benefits and the schedule flexibility and discounts, although they only gave me 16 hours a week which wasn't enough to support my bills, which is also why I left."
Safeway,1cet34mhab85je1a,2.0,"Expect to be over worked constantly, other employees constantly calling out and you having to pick up the slack. Correctional measures are only taken when management decides to make an example of you. Not worth the money you make. Customer are ignorant and always a pain to deal with. Reccomended as a job for kids fresh out of high school or older people nearing retirement not to provide for a family. Whistleblowers are constantly taking the heat instead of the actual employees not doing their job."
Safeway,1cesr2gjib81gc63,3.0,Safeway was my first place to work when I entered United States and it was very friendly atmosphere and my colleagues supported me on first steps in US soil.
Safeway,1cesqdbsfbrd9c73,3.0,The Store Manager not recommended she have favorites which is not even good on performing duties  and not enough knowledge on products and services. No training either for new clerks just start your first day and figure out yourself what to do.
Safeway,1cesn9gbqb81gcnd,4.0,Learned a lot about different types of food and how to prepare them. The staff become almost like a family. Interact with customers. opportunity to get a lot of hours.
Safeway,1cerqbechbrd9cud,4.0,"Safeway can be very fast paced, the work I did was simple to do."
Safeway,1cerfpplmb81g8im,3.0,Checking and bagging groceries. Stocked and rotated produce.  Built end displays.
Safeway,1ceq9cag9b898eio,3.0,"Lots of hours and very fast paced. Its hard for management to take a break without being interrupted. Always on call, it seemed like you worked 24/7. Not cool."
Safeway,1ceppeg9cbrd3b63,5.0,Working here was good for a beginner and showed you how to have good team work and good communication skills. It also teaches you how to work with customers. Some of the hardest part I think is loading peoples shopping bags. The management here works good with times you want or can work at.
Safeway,1cepkj4ubb818a34,2.0,"Customers are always right, even when they're wrong.   Management is not supportive.   Some favoritism is clearly allowed here.    Very little training is provided; employee morale is low."
Safeway,1cepcu65m5n94csk,5.0,"meeting new and interesting customers and greeting them with great customer service. maintaining a clean environment at all times, making sure to accommodate the customer, doing whatever task is needed to be done."
Safeway,1ceparv6rb818fum,5.0,While working for Safeway i really did enjoy the staff whom i was working along side with were really great. The management team was real understanding the type you could go to in any situation good or bad. Hours were flexible and manageable room to work around school schedules and/or another part time job whatever the case may have been.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1cep99su0brd3886,5.0,"while working at Safeway, I learned the ins and outs of the pharmacy work environment. Its a great place to work at and my coworkers were always very professional and helpful with what was needed."
Safeway,1cep4k7ufb818e8h,4.0,"Everyday is different, there is always new problems but if you have the right management team, they will help you with it. I think the job  overall is good, not to hard they are not as demanding as other jobs but ii do not think you get paid as well. In order for a company to keep loyal employees they need to take care of them and this company lacks that."
Safeway,1cep0e0l6aqh3ei0,5.0,"I was originally hired on to work in Customer Service/Bookkeeping. I did that position for over a year, and it was a lot of fun, it was busy, and some days challenging. It was great to work with all types of people with different problems or questions. I was given the opportunity to become the Fresh Cut Lead. This gave me the chance to manage my own area and learn something new. We cleaned, cut, and packaged fruits and vegetables for 6 different areas in the produce department. The room always had to be hospital clean. It was a lot of fun, hard work, and a wonderful learning experience. The most rewarding part of my job was, completing the production report each day on all product needed."
Safeway,1ceov240ob818aat,3.0,Very fast paced.  Dealing with upwards 100 customers daily can be a bit stressful. Management was helpful.  A typical day would be making salads and making sure sandwich area was stocked
Safeway,1ceomoge2b818ak3,3.0,Fast paced! Must be customer friendly! Must have good math skills! Team oriented! Must have positive attitude with customers and fellow employees! Product knowledge!
Safeway,1ceoltph7b898dsj,5.0,Every thing is good  every body is nice I would like to go back in work again. I work with good employes and  I like to work with customers . The company have good benefits and good  insurance.
Safeway,1ceokoet8b85ce8t,4.0,"Working nights is a way different than working days. At nights your in charge of getting the product to the shelf within in a reasonable time frame. Once the freight is thrown, product must be pulled to the edge of the shelf. Typical how we face is you bring two forward. At about 2:30 am, I start ordering. This normally means going through the isles and ordering products that are low or out of stock."
Safeway,1ceng7bnbb892bjo,3.0,Helping customers and help keeping the store clean. I learned to communicate better with people. I struggled with managements lack of listening skills when it came to other employees treatment of me. I liked the fact that it was close to home.
Safeway,1cen61k9jakctef5,4.0,IT was a good work experience. I learned a lot about how to work heavy machines and operate forklifts. Hours were not the best but the pay was very good
Safeway,1cen2ceur52sv8je,1.0,"Work environment was chaotic to say the least and at the stores I worked in, I was harassed by both co-workers and customers and supervisors did nothing when I reported it. I would not recommend anyone to work at Safeway."
Safeway,1celh0hscbrcu82b,4.0,I enjoyed working for Safeway for the most part. I was technically a courtesy clerk but I was being cross-trained to work in the deli and bakery as well. I also helped cashier when they were busy. Most of the managers were easy to work for and the environment was fairly pleasant. The customers were friendly for the most part. I just had one manager that expected the impossible out of me. She even told me to just clock my sweeps when I'm supposed to regardless of whether I was actually able to complete the task. I was not willing nor did I falsify my sweeps. We were often understaffed and I was stuck up on the frontline bagging groceries because I was the only courtesy clerk. I reported this to the union to protect myself in case I got in trouble later on.
Safeway,1ceks3i17b855dtb,2.0,There was always to much work and not enough help. They always had sales goals that were set so high you could never reach them. Advancement was based on popularity and if you worked your butt offf it never paid out.
Safeway,1cekp3n0dakgsf1q,3.0,"The Safeway I worked at (Bothell, WA Safeway) was great mainly because it was just a summer job for me while waiting to go back to college. Many of my high school friends were working at that location and all my co-workers in my department (Meat/Seafood) were awesome!"
Safeway,1cejegc655n91c9h,5.0,"Safeway was okay, I should of made better choices. Always give them your flexibility and set your hours. If you’re new, you’ll prob end up doing mostly midnights if you say you can only work late hours in the night."
Safeway,1ceio9o9rb855ero,4.0,"The shifts were always the same, and the Deli had a small staff, so it became easy to guess what my schedule would be like for the upcoming weeks. The only bad part about working at the deli was smelling like the food after work."
Safeway,1cehng5lmakgsduv,3.0,Safeway is a decent start for a pharmacy tech. The pay and benefits are reasonable for the job but the lack of support from management can be disappointing.
Safeway,1cehm610ub892f2k,4.0,Nearly everyday was the same as most people would come throughout the same times throughout the week. You did the same tasks everyday so it is not something that you will find super interesting but it is not also super boring as it is a grocery store and the people coming through change everyday.
Safeway,1ceh8hkc2brcub86,3.0,"You're days honestly are reflected on the mood of the customer and how you handle it. I've learned plenty of patience from this job, as well as time managment."
Safeway,1ceh392hbakctd7t,3.0,"I worked in the Customer Service Department at a Safeway in Newport, WA. I enjoyed those I worked with and management was amazing. However we were a bit short staffed so I ended up doing as much, if not more work at times-- I felt-- as my department manager. Although at the tome I hated it, I learned a lot. It is a good job, with decent benefits."
Safeway,1ceest4q5ak4vfiv,5.0,"This was a union job so the pay was good, benefits as well. There was a nice camaraderie among the staff.. It was a great experience and I am so glad to have been a part of the Safeway family."

Safeway,1ced8togpbrcub2q,4.0,"Overworking employees is not good for morale. The bakery department has weird hours, making your outside life difficult. Waking up at three, having lunch at 9, and going home at 11am, makes for a weird schedule."
Safeway,1cecdbm8sb812bet,2.0,Safeway made me feel as if I was in a hostile work environment. Always being made felt that I did something wrong when that wasn’t the case. Hours weren’t flexible to where I could balance school with work. I was forced to call in some days I was scheduled for hours I clearly stated I was not available  in the interview
Safeway,1cec9vjs85ncuav4,3.0,"It takes a unique person to be able to work overnight and also to work stocking freight. It's not the easiest but when you have the right people on the same shift, things get accomplished."
Safeway,1cebrvd3ebrcudk2,2.0,The management here is terrible.  They let the homeless congregate in the cafe area and they have started fights with customers and each other.  It's a very unsafe working environment.  I felt very uncomfortable.
Safeway,1ce9sosj6b855djc,2.0,"A typical day was answering question, phones, constant interruptions, immunizations, filling many prescriptions. Management was changing hands since the merger with Albertson. I loved most of our patients because they were kind and caring. the hardest part was all the stress corporate put upon you to do more with less help."
Safeway,1ce9mtt1jb812bn3,2.0,"A typical day usually started with clocking in, and talking to the manager about what they wanted to be started first. I learned you can get hired for a position and never get the positon you were hired for, and learned how to work better by myself. Management only looked out for themselves, let people who worked there longer get away with things that newer employees would've got in trouble for doing. Management also cut your hours whenever they felt like you didn't ""deserve them"". Most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers get what they ordered and make sure there's absolutely no mistake with their orders."
Safeway,1ce7lktq25n8u96f,3.0,"For a 1st job, it is not bad. It is no longer a career position like it has been in the past. There is no full time except for the people who are now eligible to retire."
Safeway,1ce6tj1g0as0sevf,5.0,I loved my job all I did was bookkeeping. Which is very easy. I got to meet some very wonderful customers. This was probably my favorite job I’ve ever worked
Safeway,1ce6n0ulj5ncq97f,5.0,Safeway was my first job and i really enjoyed it and I also learned alot from them i was 15 when i started to work there i will so work there again if i was in my youth but i am not

Safeway,1ce54beqeb88q98r,5.0,"I really enjoyed working at VONS. I would definitely recommend it. I t was a very fast paced working environment, plenty of thing do to. The workers are very friendly and caring."
Safeway,1ce4n2qcn5n8pcj3,2.0,"It Aint that serious if your young and want a job real quick it will do... for now. Don't expect too much other than trash customers, trash pay and some fried chicken from the deli."
Safeway,1ce4ms05qaqgpblg,3.0,"I enjoyed working at the bakery but the main reason I left was because I was told I could work the third shift consecutively and that didn't happen, so over time with the sporadic differences of my shifts my sleeping schedule became really messed up and I felt like it was affecting my day to day functions."
Safeway,1ce484qqnbrcmbjj,2.0,1st time job that you start out of move on from and grow from. Not exactly the ideal place to work as they do not like paying employees for the positions and departments they work in
Safeway,1ce46o9rsakgm8jo,3.0,"My typical day at Safeway was very pleasant and most of the customers were pleasant as well. But working their i have learned that you can change a person day from bad to good just by saying something nice. The workplace culture was better then any job i have worked at, almost everyone was nice and friendly and easy to work with. The hardest part of my job sometimes was trying to get through a 8 or sometimes 9 hour shift when my lunch wasn't given to me on time. I would be hungry in the last 5 hours of my shift. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing my customers by name and them remembering to come to me everytime i visited the store,that is when i was working of course. Making their day also made mine and that was the very most part i loved about working there."
Safeway,1ce43rs645n8pdl3,3.0,"My time at Safeway was pretty awesome. I leaned skills then, that I can still apply anywhere else. Many of these lessons and info I can pass on to anyone who doesn't know. Information is so powerful. I learned how a bakery works, how to stock shelves: make them look pretty, how to use a trash compactor, how to organize flower displays. Also another skill I want to add is how to use public transit. I would have to walk about a mile and half to the bus stop, I learned the bus schedule and to plan according when to leave my house and arrive to work on time. often showed up early."
Safeway,1ce2jk5kb5n8pcfe,5.0,"My story at Safeway started as a checker and within three months I worked my way to the closing manager of the entire store. I worked really hard, stayed longer hours than anyone else and went out of my way to make sure that the store was working at full capacity and it paid off. Management rewarded me with a promotion and I left on goods terms with no regrets."
Safeway,1ce2g1lt2brcmcm8,1.0,Not an uplifting environment kind of depressing and expect you to be there 24/7 always 9 hours shifts. Management was rude and disrespectful and it was a terrible uncleanliness to it
Safeway,1ce275usdb80pcr6,3.0,"stressful, not enough clerks i learned nothing, people are very rude to each other, the hardest part is being the only clerk on a night shift doing everything with no help, the most enjoyable is the customers they usually make your job easier and less stressful."
Safeway,1ce25l5b3b84sbjv,4.0,i would have to wear a hair net and beard net which was reasonable due to the fact i was handling food some days were busy then some slow and then some days in was in between

Safeway,1ce20pvbmb84sak6,4.0,"A workplace that you are constantly moving around to do another task, but not overwhelming, more of a keep busy thing.

Safeway,1cdtbmlpmb84sfi2,3.0,I think Safeway is a great starting point for someone trying to dip into the work force. In my experience they have great employees working for them as well as good health benefits. They are also very good about working with your schedule if say you are still in high school.
Safeway,1cdta3lfmb84s819,1.0,"Inconsistent shifts  , long nights and early morning . Very difficult for part time students to maintain such  crazy schedule . The Management were somewhat understanding about the situation. The hourly rates wasn't worth it, on top of the poor benefits and the ridiculous union fees every month.  It made it very hard to make a living with that kind of salary."
Safeway,1cdt6lk1jb84ses4,4.0,this is a great job for a first time job seeker. the enviroment was always decent w/cleanliness. my job as a produce clerk was a learn quick an work at a fast pace type.

Safeway,1cdslmuf9b84sfd7,1.0,"Pay increases were minuscule, pay was abysmal to start, and between healthcare and union dues, I was working well below what to expect from an area with a higher minimum wage than federal levels. I love unions, but the union I was in was only concerned with due fees and not the several OSHA violations and working conditions many co-workers faced in the workplace."
Safeway,1cdrhdcso52sne8q,2.0,i did not like it here managemnet was terrible and i wil not recommend anyone to work here. the store was so messy and it was not a job that i was going to work
Safeway,1cdr9iq8jak4oepc,3.0,It isnt for me but I’d work for them again if I needed too.  The Hours Changed Weekely and they’re positions were over filled so there was always confusion between workers and management.
Safeway,1cdr1dc84as0pf1g,2.0,the management was terrible. managers will be rude and disrespectful towards the employees. hours constantly being cut. the communication between the management and employees is terrible. everyone should be treated equally and fairly. management should be more attentive to how they are speaking to their employees.
Safeway,1cdqe99i3aqgp8m3,2.0,my boss didnt like anyone and would always get upset i asked for help to learn where and how we would perform the job.didnt hire other employes to help in our faclity there was supposed to be 5 to six people working over night to help insure store was stocked and it would only be me and him and he would be no where to be found unless i paged him on the intercom

Safeway,1cdq7asggak8p89g,1.0,"Did not feel fulfilled on a regular basis, and made the choice to leave the company. Management was very poor, and was never treated in a good manner."
Safeway,1cdq4cglobrcma83,4.0,"Working in Starbucks inside of Safeway was pretty simple. The worst part of the job was being required to serve people before your kiosk was open which would put you behind for the rest of the day. I don't know if that is still required of Baristas. Other than that, the job was fairly easy."
Safeway,1cdoovpv75n8pelo,4.0,"Working during the day, you spend a lot of time packing up items and putting them on the shelves. If you work later though, you have to wash everything, but if you get done early there is not much else to do.

Safeway,1cdo1sqslb84sf7p,2.0,"Safeway is run with a beat-down style of management policy. Nothing is ever good enough, deadlines are unreasonable, and goals are set too high. Even if goals are met, nasty treatment about what you did not accomplish is what is focused on. Hours are inconsistent, managers are quitting left and right, the warehouses are out of control..."
Safeway,1cdo0f8shb88qapq,4.0,"Love the management and the customers! The pay is very low for the cost of living in this area so it's a struggle even with overtime. Albertsons corporate is always making changes and that seems to annoy some people in Management more than others. I am fine with the changes, but not everyone is."
Safeway,1cdnr0u2bb84sd35,5.0,I had daily reports to verify as well as checking in with my team on the status of their desk. I would meet with various departments to ensure that pricing was accurate nd would touch bases with the divisional offices to make sure that they were supported. My team would also assist other teams that weren't meeting their daily duties and would also do presentations for the department as well as other special projects.
Safeway,1cdneesbgb80pfcg,1.0,"Often not up front with work schedules and job requirement with candidates.  The union environment controls the work flow of the business, leaders have no say so."

Safeway,1cdn6vco25n8pfc6,5.0,"Its a nice environment if you let it be. I grew up basically at that Safeway so it was easy to adapt to my surroundings. It has its drama, but its a nice place to work. I'd recommend it to anyone."
Safeway,1cdma7aij1agu7tu,3.0,Learned something new each day.  I really enjoyed working with the public and helping out customers.  The most difficult part of the job was balancing all the tills by 11pm and closing the books quickly so the cash registers were only down for a few minutes while customer waited to cashout.
Safeway,1cdm3i5b51agu4ds,3.0,It would be a regular work day. I learned how to use certain chemicals with certain things. I learned how to manage my time better while working. The hardest part about the jobs was getting a break.
Safeway,1cdlsr7jh1fdr2vi,4.0,I loved working this company. I learned alot from different meat cutter. The different kind of people you meet. And there benfits are not bad. The managment team help you out any way they can.
Safeway,1cdlgkv7m1fdr7ud,1.0,Not enough hours to have more staff and not enough pay to keep up with the cost of living. Raises come around almost every 3 years but the raises was chump change.
Safeway,1cdlbpoci1aid34d,4.0,"It was a great job, I loved it, it get boring after awhile standing in one spot or even doing jobs that the booth clerks are supposed to be doing.  They keep you busy while they can take their time."
Safeway,1cdl9gc14b84jeot,4.0,The co-workers were extremely friendly.  The manager and assistant manager were great.  Hours were great if you are a part-time type of a person.  A typical day consisted of just managing carts and bagging grocery.  What I learned during the job was how to be a cashier.  The customers that go through the Vons were great as well.  Didn't have one single problem with a customer.
Safeway,1cdl5pudj1d0c3d1,4.0,"good starting job for a person going into the workforce, not an area that you want to make as a career. This is a fun place to work at but the management made it a difficult place to work at."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1cdl5nkjj1fdr5vh,5.0,Safeway is a really good company to work for the only I would say is that when the contract changes most of the time it’s only good for the workers who have been there for a while. The company needs to change to benefit ALL their employees including the courtesy clerks.
Safeway,1cdktmvbd0mtf1sj,1.0,This was my First job and this was a terrible experience. I would personally never recommend any one to work for them. they have a very unsettling work environment.

Safeway,1cdj0hvrd0mtq2q2,3.0,"Its a check stand job, not rocket science. You do this as your first or second job in high school or college, cant expect much out of it, you bag items, ring things up and sometimes collect carts."
Safeway,1cdipl5pl1fdr342,3.0,Next to all the customers demands and managers telling you what to do. This is a good high school/part time job if you just want to get some easy and fast money.
Safeway,1cdipge1rb88hasd,4.0,"Cashiers make on average 8.75$/hour, which is a respectable wage. Maybe actually enough to live on if you have a roommate. But for part time or full time work if you live with others, it's acceptable."

Safeway,1cdh4t41e1d0c6sg,3.0,"I got my first job with Safeway back in my teens. While I didn't mind and it served me well through high school, the corporate influence on some stores can be a strain. It can depend on location as to work environment, too! Enjoyed learning a number of jobs in a number of departments in my time with Safeway, especially the floral and bakery areas."

Safeway,1cdgtlmkg1fdr633,3.0,"I learned a lot working at Safeway. I met a lot of people, and I enjoyed the majority of it. I don't think I would go back. There were times when I had trouble with the hours, and there were many times when our breaks were not given to us when they should have been."
Safeway,1cdgqnb9pb84jcie,5.0,"I enjoyed seeing the same customers several times a day, and knowing exactly where the item they were looking for was located. as well as knowing customers by first names."

Safeway,1cdgero9a0mcr1s6,5.0,You did your job and got breaks when they were due. There seemed to be a lot of respect for management and employees were treated fair. I hated to leave this job.
Safeway,1cdg1pttv0mtf5bm,4.0,Its exactly how it looks if you're there grocery shopping. Either you have work to do or you stand in front of the cash register your entire shift....
Safeway,1cdftsp50b84jd01,1.0,Upper management of Safe Sucks and they have no idea what they were doing. Very lousy management and organization from CEO dow to my level. That is why that compay was sold out
Safeway,1cdfqk1vm1baf3jd,3.0,"Typically a regular day the manager would be late and then yell at other employees for being even 5 minutes late. Not the best place to work overall. The hours were ridiculous, one could be working at 1pm one day then called in at 4 am the next day."
Safeway,1cdfpv9rq1baf4sd,1.0,"The manager was unorganized. Spent most of the day cleaning the floors, stocking shelves and bagging groceries for shoppers. My coworkers were friendly"

Safeway,1cddj7f061d0c4nf,4.0,"I started as a courtesy clerk and was promoted several times as a GM - dot com and Starbucks. I then became a checker and later found out that they only promoted me to reset my hours so I would not get a larger raise, pretty shabby Safeway... I then became a department manager because they again did not want me to get a larger raise. However, the experience I got as a manager, to me is priceless. They told me they wanted me to finish schooling but did not want to give me time off to go to school or refund any of my business classes. I ended up quitting to further my education. Now Safeway won't hire me as an intern... Real nice of them."

Safeway,1cdc6rb021d0c7m6,2.0,"Management was horrible all around. Sick time was hard to used back when i worked here, had to miss three days in order to use your time. Everyone always seemed grumpy and unhappy to be there. it was hard for me to deal with the drama within my department, you know, adults should be adults. I did meet a lot of friends I will probably have for a long time. And the health care was kind of bad, but dental was amazing!!"
Safeway,1cd9fvh29b84jc63,5.0,Work wa always stress free once you got the hang of where things were located in the store. It was self taught but other team members could help out. Very organized. Quiet.
Safeway,1cd9bg9hab84je72,2.0,They do not pay for all the work you do.  Employees can be very back stabbing. People talk a lot of trash behind each others back. Customers are really rude no matter how nice you are .
Safeway,1cd92bbmtb84j9i9,4.0,"Is worked at the call center, where we had inbound calls and also outbound call to other stores. Also worked with credit card paylments.  People here were nice to work with."
Safeway,1cd8rk7e4b88h8bp,2.0,Staff was abrasive at best and didn't respond to questions well. They went through back routes in order to get you moved or fired.
Safeway,1cd8kcrde1fdr0od,3.0,I'd have enoyed it but i got the raw end of the deal with coworkers. Some are great. some made ripping my own teeth out with a pair of dull pliars ideal in comparison to their presence
Safeway,1cd8itp641d0c15d,5.0,The bakery was a fast pace and fun challenge daily to get out product and be  ready for sales . filling orders and keeping product full and rotated. I learn how to work independently and with others.
Safeway,1cd83408i1fdr47n,2.0,"The Manager, often, followed his whims and made some impractical (and legall troublesome) edicts whilst I was employed there.  The Deli was fantastic; I was not so enthused about the conditions or products of the Safeway Bakery"
Safeway,1cd80m313b88hadu,4.0,"Employees are treated fairly, fun atmosphere, Safeway provides a 10 percent discount on groceries to it's employees. Staff/Supervisors are friendly to each other."
Safeway,1cd7nnk481aht04d,4.0,Good small outfit.  Compared to other retail stores very behind in tech but have a strong core group of workers who they treat well overall.  Would work for them again.
Safeway,1cd7mnne51ahe4h9,4.0,Always stressful; glad to leave at the end of shift. Management does not consider employees needs. Vacation requests are never approved on first submission; always have to re-submit a couple of times before management approves.
Safeway,1cd782tqv1fdr62s,2.0,"Safeway is only a job that is for management or something temporary, due to the fact that the pay is low for a normal level worker. the customers at the store at work at work is only soccer moms who had no patience and old white people complaining about not having fresh chicken. my manger was an okay manger, i loved that she laughed at other peoples comments about her and her deli."
Safeway,1cd6g695q1d0c16k,2.0,The Work and Pay and Hours are Good
Safeway,1cd608pag1ahe21b,3.0,"I was the youngest one working, yet was the most likely to be called in. People often skipped work days, and were rarely reprehended. Managers would often disagree, and would try to scheduled me during high school hours. They did not fallow age restricted laws, and have the employees were high on the job. If one was a responsible worker they would get more work piled on with no benefits."
Safeway,1cd46u1fa1fdo5k1,2.0,"you learn how to communicate with customers, co-workers and management. Gain knowledge about groceries, product, and merchandise. hardest part- scheduling- its retail- they rather you have open availability. Enjoyable part is creating bonds with the neighborhood families that come often."

With the right management inline.. creates an outstanding atmosphere for everyone, including the customers. In order to have a great manager, they need to have a great District Manager. Those are usually hit and miss. Most of them THINK they know each and every department, not true!"
Safeway,1cd3utihn1d092su,5.0,Safeway is a very safe place to work at. My co-workers were all very welcoming and nice. Working at Safeway teaches you to have a lot of patience and teaches you customer service.

Safeway,1cd2mk3uu0kbq7kh,1.0,"The is speaking just for the Deli department at Safeway nearest my location. Management was really bad. A lot of things would be reported to HR but would go unnoticed. Toxic place to work. Any other department is fine, just the deli is the rotten apple in the bundle."
Safeway,1cd1fk3671d1f0rv,4.0,"I worked as a courtesy clerk and a bakery clerk, averaging 30+ hours a week. Management was nice, the job was fairly easy although very quick paced and a lot to do each night as a closer that made it a bit stressful. No benefits unless you're a manager or are full time for a full year."
Safeway,1cd12i22a1d1f5sc,4.0,"A typical day at work would vary for me. During school I generally worked after school, working the 3:30PM-12:00AM shift. As for when Summer rolled around I would work until 8:00AM-3:00PM. I learned how to properly interact and assist customers. I also learned how to let those in charge of me what my schedule was and how to work out a working schedule for us both. The workplace culture was very relaxed, everyone knew what they had to do and just did it. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the bathrooms. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people, whom I got along very well with."
Safeway,1cd0s682n1d1f2m7,3.0,a typical day at Safeway involves stocking shelves and cleaning the isles. This is when you are not assisting customers or taking back any perishables or go-backs to the shelves
Safeway,1cd0rgqvj1bad740,4.0,Safeway is fast paced. Management changes frequently and that can have pro and cons. There is also a high turn over rate of employees.Good opportunities for growth.
Safeway,1cd0r87i01d0903f,3.0,There is always a chore that you can work on. They let you clean a lot too which I liked. I also like the jobs no one wanted so it made the day go by faster. One co-worker though is quite unbearable
Safeway,1cd0qft5i1d1f24t,1.0,Terrible management. Only looking after themselves. Would throw people under the bus all the time. Terrible management of weekly hours for workers to have a stable work environment.
Safeway,1cd0mu2q01d1f6a2,1.0,"Safeway was a great place to work until Albertsons took over.  Safeway was all about customer service, now that its Albertsons, it's all about the profit!"
Safeway,1ccvspoos1bgb1kk,4.0,"Not much to say everything started changing when the store was bought out, the people are friendly though. I recommend knowing how to have fun while you work."
Safeway,1ccva5g5d1d091ia,1.0,"Well the first issue was not knowing your hours until the very day of when you were supposed to work. Lousy wages, poor management, mentally challenged workforce and customers."

Safeway,1ccuncbhdas0re5n,3.0,"The store managers are extremely lazy and rude with the exception of the second assistant who is the only store manager that does work and is very friendly. There are two good department managers. All of the front end managers are amazing, the produce manager is also amazing. With any other department you will have to rely on your coworkers to keep you positive because your managers will tear you down with their lazyness and ignorance. The pay is decent and the customers are what you expect the public to be, it varies. The hours are pretty decent but do fluctuate. Certain managers are willing to work with you. The pay increases every 6 months and after a year you are provided benefits and vacation days. It's not always fast paced but it can get busy. The front end managers always help during busy times and breaks are always right on time."
Safeway,1ccuh8k7j1d0i40f,3.0,"You are always on your feet, and non-stop moving. The people you work with are fun and the people you help or give customer service to are sometimes frustrating. Then you have management which can be good or bad, it just depends on the person taking charge. It's not hard, but you better be fast and give good quality work."
Safeway,1ccubs7kfak4rd7n,2.0,"My typical day started after lunch, where I'd deal with slacking co-workers untill the later hours of the day. We'd be left with very few employees when dinner rushes hit-usually 2, 3 on a good day. due to the heavy traffic, the closing crew would struggle without the third man to meet the closing deadlines. counter at ten, everything by eleven."
Safeway,1ccttioo5brd3db1,1.0,Safeway does not care about their employees. They do not hire enough people to be a successful with customers and staff. Overwork employees to make up for lack of staff but refuse to give full-time hours.

Safeway,1ccrqpnb8aqgpej7,2.0,For my first job this was a horrible introduction to the working world. It was a tough work atomosphere and the only friends I made at work were ones I had already known prior to working there. Not worth the hassle
Safeway,1ccr73pgtakgp87p,2.0,Safeway always needed to improve in support; improve in technology; and listen to those employees in the trenches in order to make sure that every thing being done to support the locations was being done.
Safeway,1ccqv7ihcbrd3avs,4.0,"it is a fast paced job.  daily job duties.  they don't discriminate on race, management supports the department managers, I enjoy the fast paced physical part of the job.  Management has to be firm and consistant."
Safeway,1ccqstfn41d0i7n0,2.0,"Safeway had provided me with a good retirement, however my issue with this company was that the later years a person was not held accountable for their actions and as a manager it was very hard to get upper manager support for problems within the departments. I was very much in favore of team work and everyone doing there job for the good of the department, however it was very hard to get the support to do ones job as manager. Didn’t like how I felt in just letting everyone do as they wished and needed to move on."
Safeway,1ccp9vmjn1d126sc,3.0,"a typical day at work would consist of watering the plants, doing the load if there is one, cleaning the tables, refilling the buckets, checking for dead product, redoing the arrangements, refilling all the balloons in the card aisle and check stands with the themes it goes with, and making sure that everything is in its place. I learned how to take care of plants, how to make flower arrangements, and how to deal with difficult customers. Management always wants whats best for the company and doesn't care about the needs of the employees. The hardest part about this job would be all the tasks that needed to get done in a short amount of time while being the only one working. The most enjoyable part about this job is building a connection with customers, making arrangements or doing wraps for others and getting complimented on your work."
Safeway,1ccosg5btbrd3893,2.0,Stressful work place. Management was not the greatest they really didn't care about their employees. Didn't learn much form the job their. Bad communication from managers
Safeway,1ccmb3tbkbrd3b8f,2.0,"A usual day at the Deli's closing shift included help customers while cooking and cleaning endlessly this is always stressful, but rushing to clean and break down the everything before you incur any overtime is even worse. This job is only for people that are fit or fast food prodigies if no prepare for constant abuse from your manager. The manager gets yelled at so they yell at you and there is no understanding or improvement at the job, training by your actual manager is minimal it's usually done by co-workers who may be doing the work incorrectly.The hardest part of this job is expectations, the most enjoyable part of it is co-workers and fun customers."
Safeway,1ccmabpopb816d0k,3.0,"Receiving and checking incoming pick tickets, locating products using technology, retrieving orders according to quantity, size and ensuring accuracy.Very fast paced.

Safeway,1ccjfkehlb816b8q,5.0,Good place to work with great benefits. We have a union which is a nice thing to have. It's very helpful. The managers do a good job to work with your schedule if you go to school.
Safeway,1ccjduf5dak4rfp5,4.0,I managed the Deli Department with a total staff of 5. I tried to create a fun environment for everyone to work in. Retail can be a challenge. People aren't always the nicest. I went out of my way to insure customers got what they needed.

Safeway,1ccgm0panb816arn,2.0,It was annoying to work there. Management sat in the office on their phones all day and yelled at all the workers who didn’t seem like they were doing something 24/7
Safeway,1ccf9gqg5b88mdm4,3.0,While my coworkers were very nice the over all atmosphere was very stressful and poorly managed. We would have lines way too long and the back up cashiers and upper staff would be in the break room or wandering the isles instead of responding. This would make the customers irritable
Safeway,1ccf86scmak8rdlt,3.0,"The work itself was not hard to do. The worst part was dealing with customers. Overall, it was my coworkers that made the job bearable. I was able to get in the prep room so I did not have to deal with angry customers as often"
Safeway,1ccf5r1h7b88mf4k,1.0,"If you want to be under paid, over worked. and mistreated daily, then this is a perfect job choice. You are only a number instead of a valued employee.

Safeway,1ccd36q2ub816800,1.0,"The manager isn't great, the work place isn't perfect. The pay is bad and the managers take advantage of their employees. No security and the managers are rude. A typical day at work would be jumping from job to job with no help and no idea what to do. I barely learned anything from working at Safeway. The management doesn't do their jobs. The management never does their jobs properly. The workplace culture isn't great, rude people and disrespect from everyone. The hardest part of the job is having to do everything myself. I even had to do managers jobs for them because they didn't want to do them. So they told me to do it. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to see my co workers that are actually nice."
Safeway,1cccqgcee52t0dap,4.0,"Hey, I had a fun time on trying to make customers happy. I did like having a lot of things to do through out the day. The mangers worked out my schedur. so that my dad can drop me off and for him to go to work."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1cc2hji41brd3baj,1.0,"Very busy and stressful at times. Prolong standing, walking and constantly on the move. Direct contact with shoppers to solve customer concerns. I'm also involved in checkout service to reduce grocery lines."
Safeway,1cc29ivfqb88l9r6,2.0,"Pharmacy hours being cut and workload increased. At full service Pharmacy's, that being the ones that offer Travel meds, Mental health injections, Deliveries and and unit dosing it makes for a hectic day."
Safeway,1cc21jiv1b85e874,3.0,"Safeway is an okay place to work for. However, in my experience there I noticed that such places as freezer/refrigerator area in the sense of inventory and organization was very disorganized."
Safeway,1cc210bdvbrd2amt,3.0,The company is very flexible both in terms of hours and positions that are available to work in but the clientele in the area is constantly very aggressive and current change in management is leading to some drastic changes in work environment.
Safeway,1cc1vldt952sveok,2.0,"A typical day at work usually included cleaning aisles and bathrooms, bagging groceries, and pushing carts. Eventually the job only consisted of bagging groceries and we were not allowed to do most anything else. I didn't learn that much, but I did learn how to complete tasks on time and how to collaborate. The managers were mean and demanding, and they were often rude to employees who were asking questions. Workplace culture was apathetic. The hardest part of the job was bagging groceries, but the most enjoyable part of the job was pushing carts."
Safeway,1cc1e7h45brd2erk,2.0,A typical day of work would be coming in to cut and package fruit while waiting for following employees to come in at later times. I learned how to properly cut and package fruits and veggies while maintaining food health standards.
Safeway,1cbvva6j3b814fak,3.0,"Honestly, it's a good job to have if you're in school or in between looking for full-time. It's a relaxed environment and you get to meet a lot of people. The drawbacks are little to no benefits, you get awful hours if you don't have seniority, and the customer is always right even when they're blithering idiots. It's a simple way to make money."
Safeway,1cbvuqdk2b814aba,2.0,"A typical day as a bookkeeper lasted about 8-9 hours. To balance the cashier tills, we had to count and record all paper and coin currency in the safe. After balancing and delivering all the tills to every register and department in the store, we prepared the Guarda pick-up bags. Throughout the day, we would also assist all customers at the customer service desk, providing general assistance along with lottery and Western Union transactions. Occasionally we would assist with any technical issues with receipt printers, cash registers, and self-check out registers."
Safeway,1cbvr82nrb85c8l3,3.0,"If you are a Teenager or Single parent needing to get on your feet in the working world, Safeway is a great place to start."
Safeway,1cbvr75k3b85cbqa,4.0,"While I wouldn't say it was the most advanced job, it prepared for jobs in the real world and allowed me to immerse myself in workplace culture. Management was pretty good, although flawed in parts, and created a good work-life balance."
Safeway,1cbvgifeob88kb5b,5.0,"very fast pace, helping customers, custmoser service is the number one most important thing. hardest part is pleasing everyone the most enjoyable was having ur regulars and them being so positive"
Safeway,1cbv6mriqb85cabb,2.0,Some of the worker are nice. The front end manager isn’t really that great and the hours for full time suck if you say can’t work a certain day . When you work the closing shift you may be alone for an hour or so up front
Safeway,1cbv677jdb88k8tb,5.0,"I really enjoyed learning how to manage not only myself in respect to my superiors and subordinates, but also how to manage the customer, the culture of coffee, and the daily speed of business. It was challenging managing such a wide range of people but it strengthened me as an employee and employer."
Safeway,1cbuuaculakcn8v6,3.0,I am not sure about the how the company is now as I have not worked for them in a couple of years. While i was working there it was fast paced and stressful as you are dealing with people and food .
Safeway,1cbuqidueb85c9rq,5.0,Even though the job was fast paced it feel fluent I was happy working there it was not as stressful as I thought it was going to be. It felt like a family friendly environment which was great.
Safeway,1cbt073rlbrd1dno,4.0,"Job duties as courtesy clerk consisted, sweeping the"
Safeway,1cbsscp6vbrd19sa,1.0,"none, Not a good culture. Benefits were good.  Out of town stores work more with the employee's then Phoenix based stores.  It is all about who you know.  Give up your personal life and you will get hours that is the expectations."
Safeway,1cbsr1o43as0pege,2.0,"I liked working here as a first job, but there was no room for advancement and no benefits. The hours were extremely inconsistent. I enjoyed working with the store manager, but lower-position managers were not always helpful. Not much room for creativity or suggestions. Such a strong focus is placed on getting good surveys, that they don't actually care about what is in the surveys that they can improve upon. Would recommend for a first job for high school students. Wouldn't recommend for anyone looking to make a living or improve their working experience."
Safeway,1cbsnc2liak4pcs9,4.0,Helping customers with their decisions in buying food and groceries.
Safeway,1cbslaqvc5j4p8i6,4.0,"The hardest part of the job depends on where you work, I would not recommend being a cashier doesn't seem fun from what I've seen, just saying. But I would recommend fruit cutter position."

Safeway,1cbsfv788b88k842,4.0,"Like many other grocery positions, Safeway is a relatively decent job but is often plagued by poor management, ineffective unions, and static pay. However, the experience varies greatly from store-to-store, as upper management doesn't interact with store employees too much."
Safeway,1cbse9da0aqgnbte,5.0,pleasant experience working with different people who come from different backgrounds and cultures. Working as a team to reach the goal was the most important thing i learnt while working for Safeway.

Safeway,1cbr3v4knb810f23,3.0,"Safeway was a tough job, but fair in other ways. there was many oprotunites to move in different positions in the store. the management was poor at the time and lack of communication."
Safeway,1cbpkid8r5n8q8da,3.0,Cool laid-back job just had to make sure you finished your deliveries in a timely fashion and not bring anything back to store the pay wasn't the best but it helped
Safeway,1cbn7330fb8579cr,5.0,"For the Deli it was standard deli service, clean up, processing food that does not carry over to the next day. And closing procedures. For Starbucks I had the opening shift. Set up, guest service and shift change. Stopped working here due to a car accident that had me life lighted to U.C. Davis for emergency spine surgery. Was getting ready to promote to produce."
Safeway,1cbm393s1aqgkcc1,2.0,"Great pay, hard to find that anywhere else. Expectations from higher ups is outrageous.  Lots of room to move up and around the store. Most managers are good.. union protects people who don't want to work."
Safeway,1cblumoehbrctbkd,1.0,"Poor management, poor pay. I was continuously given more and more responsibility in my department, enticed by offers of pay increases and none were ever given to me. Fellow employees who were unprofessional and down-right rude to customers and who did not ever do their job all the way, much less well, were never reprimanded and continued to somehow be awarded more work hours than employees who performed well and were professional and courteous."
Safeway,1cblhf86aak8md65,1.0,Management will go back on their word and say they never agreed in the first place. Not a good place to work. Hours given were not was applied for. Bad place to work.
Safeway,1cbjqfifab810e5u,1.0,Raises were okay and management was okay too just a little picky with who was cool and who was inconsiderate. Good place for high school students needing ectra cash. Not a career place.
Safeway,1cbis38ifaqgk8td,3.0,I did enjoy working for Safeway and they were good to work for. This is more of an entry position in my opinion because of the pay and hours. I did enjoy this job and they provided a lot of valuable job skills for suture positions
Safeway,1cbirm307brctadv,4.0,"It is not a difficul work to handle. Customers come form different backgroud. Being a casher, I am able to meet,  talk and learn from different customers. Manager will value your work and respect each employees. I am promoted to be a customer service and learn to manage money in the bookkeeper office. Colleagues are from different culture and places, we respect each other and get along well too. I like to work with different people since I could learn a lot from them."
Safeway,1cbi76kmvak8mdk4,5.0,It is a great place to work. I have worked for the company for eight years and do not regret it. the company has great benefits and vacation time. I love my job.
Safeway,1cbi6qv06akgkfsb,1.0,They switch managers every 3 months and they treat their employees very poorly and the union is no help. They favor certain employees and the spread of rumors and hostility between employees is unbearable.
Safeway,1cbi2p8df5ncq8ig,5.0,"If you're looking for a first or second job this is a wonder place to learn and grow from, there's plenty of departments that you can develop and grow in. There is a lot of potential from working here"
Safeway,1cbgm5oj8brct89c,3.0,fast pace
Safeway,1cbggvt48ak8m9ia,1.0,We were always underpaid and short staff. Management was never around except to tell you that you were not good enough. Hours were very low and pay was bad. It was nearly impossible to get time off without them cutting your hours.
Safeway,1cbgg71lab857a8j,1.0,"My first job and the last job I'll ever work with this company. Calling it ""Slaveway"" is an understatement. Horrible management, horrible corporate employees, horrible store conditions, horrible hours all for the lowest possible pay."
Safeway,1cbftki7vb88gc0q,3.0,Ever since the merger there has been a tremendous amount of work to do with very little support from senior leadership and backstage support. This is mostly due to extreme cost control measures and the elimination of many support positions which made the retailers job easier.
Safeway,1cbflnl4c52sq8sq,4.0,They will always find something for you to do.

Safeway,1cbfcr8d9b857b48,5.0,Have to help customers with retail. A typical day is usually very busy. The store has a customers shopping. Some of them complain. Managers follow the policy of Customer is always right
Safeway,1cbf20t9b5j4mcc3,4.0,Very nice place to work. You will meet a lot of people. You must be energetic. Always keep a clear head because there will be times when the customer won’t be happy but it will be your job to make them happy and want to come back.
Safeway,1cbduelh2as0kace,5.0,Safeway was such a wonderful place to work. The employees were so helpful and kind. We all got along so great and worked well as a team. The store was always very clean and well stocked.
Safeway,1cbds3suibrcqbjj,3.0,"start work at 615am, get off at 4pm."
Safeway,1cbdom4i2brcq9en,3.0,"A good job if you need money and are going to school, other than that I would avoid it at all costs. That's not to say it was the most awful place to work, but they definitely didn't care about their work force."
Safeway,1cbdhhpfnak8kagd,5.0,"I was the general merchandise manager and in charge of 2 people and was in charge of orders, stocking, credits, inventory,modules, ans all the seasonal and holiday merchandise and placement of these items.I  never had a bad inventory and attribute that to having a great manager that cared and was available for me to ask questions and resolve any problems that arose."
Safeway,1cbdh1lgdbrcqcfo,1.0,"Having to consistantly look over your shoulder because of coworkers or Management lack of role, it made for a horrible experience.  I made several coworkers but met very few friends."
Safeway,1cbcv9nagak8kf4h,2.0,"The store allowed advancement but the union kept people in positions that should not be allow to be in those areas for safety, customer service and reliability that prevented advancement in several situations.  Union protected the wrong people and could not opt out when they did not protect you as a newer employee vs one that had been there longer."
Safeway,1cbcsssn4b854dkn,1.0,"Working there was bearable. There was no set schedule and I'd often get 2:15pm-11:15pm shifts that would line up with 11am-8pm shifts, and the time between those shifts is ridiculous. Coworkers are a pleasure to be around, minus one of them. Management doesn't understand the severity of situations and rarely ever communicates with the fuel station, unless they call us. Hardest part of the job is customer service. Long lines, impatient people, and complaints are frequent. The most enjoyable part is working with my coworkers."
Safeway,1cbcnf26fbrcqd7m,3.0,It can be stressful and exciting at the same time.  You have the opportunity to advance it just takes a long time and you have to ask about it constantly.
Safeway,1cbchsjjq5n8od3k,5.0,this place has an union which comes in handy when you have problems with the managers so you wont have no problems the only problem is the 90 wait period.
Safeway,1cbb4jtrvb80s88m,3.0,"I worked here for almost two years. When I was going to college in the fall, they reduced my hours to 10 a week, and did not tell me I could transfer. The one time I needed money, and they cut my hours for the whole summer. The management did not care about you, unless they had a problem that they knew you could fix. But that was just at my store."
Safeway,1cbb4bb4vb854ao7,3.0,You had to deal with threats from customers and the homeless everyday. And if you defended your self you were written up or had your hours cut. And you had to act as LP which was not part of the duties originally.
Safeway,1cbb24iqjb80seqt,3.0,"I think Safeway is a good company but the management wasn't great. Also as the only female of my position, I felt like I was taken advantage of because my male coworkers didn't care about work and placed a lot of the work on me (maybe it was just a personality thing idk). But it was good pay and weekly, which I liked."
Safeway,1cbauos091d13131,5.0,Safeway is quick paced job to work at. The customers and employees are wonderfully nice. The hardest part of the job can be going through all of customers needs and lots of heavy lifting.
Safeway,1cbajk0dcbrcqdhu,4.0,"Safeway is an outstanding place to work whether you are seeking part time or full time. Unfortunately the pay raises, very shifty schedules and lack of future career opportunities causes many people to leave. Overall a great community!"
Safeway,1cbab55911d131qt,2.0,Safeway would be a good job for a young college kid. But I feel that they will promote younger kids just to try and lock them into being at the company for their entire working life.
Safeway,1cba7idkab854ekk,5.0,"Acts with integrity, honesty and knowledge that promote the culture, values and mission of Starbucks."
Safeway,1cb9vbdk7brcqf68,3.0,Safeway was kind of a stressful job for me I’m not going to put it all the way down but it just wasn’t right for me. Others might enjoy working there and you can move up too if your 18 up it might be a little better for you.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1cb94tuh0ak8jb4u,3.0,it was a typical work place
Safeway,1cb902f951d130i1,5.0,I honestly have nothing to say except to get better management in some areas of the store and take care of your employees before it’s already to late.
Safeway,1cb8e1hiqb80qfn9,5.0,I absolutely loved working at Safeway every person there was awesome and friendly. the management had one or two bad eggs but over all i loved them all. Safeway is an amazing place to work
Safeway,1cb8bhr2kak4jbr4,1.0,Will not be surprised when they close all of the doors
Safeway,1cb85sa4v5n8n9t3,4.0,Used to be a good place to work but has gone down over the last few years. Union is weak. Management is a sucker to corporate. They don't protect their employees.
Safeway,1cb855fqpb80qcq1,4.0,I really don't like doing reviews. I liked working there. There were pros and cons much like any other job in the world. Safeway was good to me. And I will always be grateful to Safeway.
Safeway,1cb80rrnrb80qbhf,2.0,I was told the low wage was because of the amount of health coverage we would receive...Safeway would pay for it all. It sounded good  except when it was supposed too come in it didnt.

Safeway,1cb6ffecsb80qevm,4.0,Safeway show you what a true work place family is. you laugh and have fun and its great. i do regret leaving but i couldn't work with bullies anymore.
Safeway,1cb5i077h5j4j8ac,3.0,"Really fast paced then boring, customers enjoyable mostly, other employees rude to each other and when busy no where to be found for back up, manager not in to helping with life situations at all."
Safeway,1cb4q8p0kb852f9b,1.0,Terrible place to work. No reliable hours per week. Must come in on own time to pick a schedule but have no idea when senior co-workers will pick their schedule so you can pick yours.Schedule changes without notice. Micromanaged one minute and left to figure out next minute. No positive reinforcement. A good day is being unnoticed. No incentive to achieve. Pay raises random. Poor performers get department positions.
Safeway,1cb3pgtk3b8528vo,3.0,"I work in the fuel kiosk, and you learn real quick that customers do not care about you. Customers are rude, but it's all worth it to get paid right? Well not really. As a fuel kiosk attendent, I get minimum wage, even though I have to clean the fuel pad, take out trash, clean everything in and around the kiosk, clean up fuel spills, deal with customers, clean the pumps, restock merchandise, and other misc chores. Inside the store, they have other employees strictly for those jobs, but not out there. We do everything and are not fairly compensated. If an executive is visiting, you work a great deal extra with no over time pay to kiss the exects butt. Yes, you heard right. NO overtime, it is for some reason super against Safeway to be fair to employees. They make you sign up for union benifits, but often repay the favor with bad pay and other nasties. I have have been told a few times that I cannot have a lunch break, though it union rules. If you need a job, this is a great place to start. If you are in High School, I say go for this job. If not, it's still better than Walmart."
Safeway,1cb3kofqhb80qfmp,4.0,Sometimes it get's really busy and some days are slow. It's fun but sometimes in can get stressful when don't have the help and when someone calls out.
Safeway,1cb34qalhb896bn8,4.0,"It was fun to work with customers, to help them to find what they were looking for. Also you can see how much customers appreciate your help, especially doing carryout."
Safeway,1cb2otpnlaqghfff,5.0,"I enjoyed working for safeway because it gave me a lot of opportunities.  Once my family started I needed to make more money, so I needed to move on.  I did receive a lot of training in different areas of safeway which was really nice.  Its a great place to start working at if you are young."
Safeway,1cb21jpg6ak4je61,2.0,"Hours were shortened after first week, Break room was always dirty,management was not patient with new employees, Employees picked on each other. Nothing else to add."
Safeway,1cb1m2b19b896amb,3.0,Not good they dont care about anything that goes on in your life outside of work. They for the most part dont care about how hard you have to work and how much you have to give up to get a hob done
Safeway,1cb0u250mb896clh,4.0,I would like to be off weekends because I have small kids. You’re required to multi task when others aren’t. For the same pay. Want to learn new things about other jobs.

Safeway,1cb0pbvc9brco830,2.0,"Safeway was my first job.  As a first job, I would say it isn't that bad, but I feel trapped there.  The hours are extremely inconsistent, and the store manager doesn't really make scheduling a priority, they would randomly assign everyone in the various departments. This lead to a lot of issues, such as gaps in coverage during peak hours or no lunch coverage which then had to be made up by the employees working extra hours.  Although the extra hours were not unwelcome, it felt as if the managers just didn't care about their mistakes and didn't really take responsibility, even though part of their job was to create and approve the schedule."
Safeway,1cb0onfnkb896d8h,1.0,I wouldn’t recommend Safeway as a job career. There is a lot of negatives and not to many positives. The work environment wasn’t the cleanest and the mangager wasn’t very nice.
Safeway,1cb0mtu35b852e9g,2.0,you can expect that there will not be enough help for the customers and everything to get done as well unless there is a corporate walk through in which case there too many people there
Safeway,1cb0k5iubb852dkg,5.0,Great place to work loved everyday there and I would definitely suggest this job to someone else. Very friendly co workers and management made it easy
Safeway,1cb07p2ecas0j9q5,1.0,"never have I worked in a union atmosphere  so this  was totally new ground for me , I thought the Union was there to help you it was there to help the  union reps and not employees"
Safeway,1cb05i29b5j4j9d2,4.0,"They really do encourage growth within the company and will push you towards a senior position if they see something in you. The ONLY complaint I have was that I never received my raise after my probation period and the pay was to low to live off of, at the time."
Safeway,1cb03klb6b852ert,4.0,Safeway is an awesome job for someone who has no responsibilities outside of work and paying bills. Not a job for someone who likes spending time with their family. Pay is great! Lots of hours.
Safeway,1cb025m0u5ncncek,5.0,"I just started and I like it for the most part .  It's not stressful , easy to learn , Employer is easy to work with , and the co workers are friendly . I like that fact that once you learn the job you are basically on your own with the responsibility of Satisfying the customers who use the service you provide"
Safeway,1cavu8sc8b852eu5,4.0,"Safeway is a great comany to work for and an actual career you can grow in. I just got stuck at a bad safeway. As a CC you do carts, bagging help, sweeps, and go backs. As a checker, you interact with customers while you check them out of the store."
Safeway,1cavols055j4j9n6,3.0,"Responsibilities included checking out prescriptions, answering telephone inquiries, and pharmacist referrals. Focused on the customer service and prescription ordering process, as well as problem resolution and inventory management."
Safeway,1cau2v9icb80qefh,4.0,"When it’s busy it’s fun! Makes the time go by faster and enjoyable. Constantly cleaning. When not busy theirs always something to do such as;  brewing coffee, looking for expired dates, cleaning syrup pumps, pitchers, blenders etc."
Safeway,1cat46kk6b8969bk,5.0,"It’s a retail job, fast paced , hard work , and must be able to multi task. Your able to get into management pretty fast if you work hard. It’s a good place to work for."
Safeway,1casrsfg5b852bac,4.0,Lot of new technologies slowly migrating here. Lot of fun activities and good management. It is great to learn lot of new stuff. Managers are helping to peers.
Safeway,1cas2qdclb84vcla,2.0,Safeway will teach you how to deal with the general public  it’s a good job if your fresh out of  or still in high school  but it now takes a long time to top out  so you will be making pretty much nothing for a long time but I hated the fact that every week was a different schedule and never had two days off in a row it’s like they are against people actually having two days off in a row  and if you want a weekend off good luck
Safeway,1cardbfuvb8938vc,3.0,Amazing work culture / fun environment where you can position yourself for success and really grow within your career. Everyone is very helpful and knowledgable. It really is a great company to work for.
Safeway,1caqotk801bae3j1,3.0,"Training needs to be provided for individuals who move up into a higher position. Department Managers need to be able to discuss issues with the Company Manager without being told they are wasting time. The Company Manager should be willing to listen to a Department Managers issues without being told they are making excuses.  A typical day is fast paced and can be stressful.  Team work is a priority.  Everyone has a set amount of work to be done but must also be able & willing to jump in and help out in any area of the department.  It was nice to work in a relatively small department and I enjoyed the feeling of being part of the team.  There did seem to be a high turn around rate, especially among the part time employees.  Much of the work was repetitive but every day was different depending on what came up.  It was nice to get to know some of the customers and know their preferences.  We all strove to keep our customers happy and always tried very hard to correct anything that was unsatisfactory to adequately compensate the customer. The hardest part of the job was working in the freezer, trying to move pallets which were not very well stacked and very hard to move.  The freezer was often unorganized and it was difficult to get to a certain departments products as they were all mixed together.  I believe something should be done at the warehouse level to improve this condition."
Safeway,1caqj3ughb893eui,5.0,This company is a great company to start at and work yourself up. There is always a great number of people to help you with any questions if you are unsure about a product or trying to find it's location. I learned a lot about different hair products to different brands that customers usually come in for. The hardest thing for me at this company was finding a certain location for a item that was really it. The most enjoyable thing that I loved about working here was the customers if I was able to help out someone and just to see a smile on a customers face made me happy I love helping others.
Safeway,1cap0b1g4brcldk9,3.0,Fun place to work good people great pay and benefits understanding managment very fast paced enviroment and very  competitive place to work and a great career oppurtunity
Safeway,1caoa3jrlb80nb1c,2.0,I think the only reason I enjoyed going to work at Safeway was because of the people that I worked with. The customers were nice too but I felt like I was basically a dog playing fetch for people's groceries.
Safeway,1cao8ot4652sk9k2,5.0,I enjoyed every minute of working at Starbucks. The people were very funny and nice and they taught me a lot about the tricks and tips of coffee making. The atmosphere was fun but professional.

Safeway,1cant4bjeb84vf8g,1.0,Safeway is a very fast paced place to work with high expectations of their employees with little compensation on top of union dues no matter how many hours you get.
Safeway,1canfdf30b893e9c,2.0,"I am a baker at Safeway and really enjoy the fast-paced, multi-tasking requirements of the work so I feel conflicted about offering a poor review. Safeway doesn't value their baker's and continues to cut hours at a pitiful pay rate."
Safeway,1camfqgmvb890cvq,1.0,To much favertisum so it makes it a bad place to work for . You have to be in good with there little click or else you will be the black sheep in the bunch .
Safeway,1camc9jhs1ai10u1,2.0,it was fast face with a lot of work to do at once to much for one person to handle. worked overtime way to much and got in trouble for working over time. always something new adding on to are jobs with less time. decent manager who worked there when I worked at the time. always do this do that by this time.
Safeway,1cam2bdifb80kc2u,1.0,"If you're looking for a job to fill a gap or something go ahead and apply here but honestly even if you apply for full time they'll probably give you full time, schedule you 1-3 days a week as needed and then hire someone else in your spot and cut your hours completely. As a Bakery Clerk on the night shift you basically work alone, you work on a very strict time frame expected to spend most of your day packaging leftover baked goods, baking new bread, and spending the last 2 hours of the day cleaning and closing everything in the area. clean all machines, all pans, sweep and mop floors, and even the dishwasher itself needs to be cleaned out every day. if there's a lot of packaging that needs to be done you're probably going to have to put most of it in storage for the morning shift to take care of otherwise you won't have time to finish cleaning procedures."
Safeway,1cam28upob890d94,3.0,"Working at night can be busy and stressful. My store is 24 hours. Stocking up the shelves at night and covering the register is basically our night. Management could always be better, dishonest and rude for the most part besides asking for time off it was alright. All the time we are hustling to get stuff done, no time for breaks, heck even lunch sometimes, we are that busy without the required help, trying to get an extra body for even half a shift is pulling teeth but we do not have enough people or the hours, so we roll on. There was a period of time where I worked almost a year straight for six days, very unpleasant. With so few people on the crew, you are lucky to get one day off a week. Days off are split, so it feels like you do not get any rest and because of the night crew schedule, it involves lots of sleeping and little time to enjoy life. Trying to play security to prevent theft is a huge burden. As mentioned before we are 24 hours, so we do get the crazies that come in sometimes. We have so much work to do and they are a distraction if we have to keep watching them encase they steal. Our safety is very iffy because of this. If someone one night decides to crazy and has a weapon, well...may be to late to call 911 or security by that time, even if they fairly close to us in the mall."
Safeway,1cam2056o1bg25a6,5.0,very relaxed job except on busy days. if you like working in customer service this would be a good job for you. make friends very easily. you need to help the checkers with store items.
Safeway,1calj1q6vbrcick1,5.0,I learned how to work in a team environment and also to take directions as well as give. The typical day in deli was customer service first but varied I had to receive and stock foods and drinks.
Safeway,1cale3pnfb890bb6,3.0,"Lately the labor pinch is tightening and I have to work more hours alone or with limited help, especially on weekends. This is stressful for any pharmacist. Whether your pharmacy is low or high volume doesn't matter when you factor in that all pharmacies have the same basic set of tasks to complete as required by the company."
Safeway,1cajqj39nb89081b,4.0,This is a fun place to work but can also be stressful during rushes. It is very fast-paced and there is always something to do so my shifts usually go by pretty fast. Its great to work with others and help customers and has a very friendly atmosphere. Through this job I have learned to be more confident about myself and have learned how to work with others while providing customer service.
Safeway,1cajnnnvrbrci84h,5.0,I went to work and did my job...that's it
Safeway,1caj7qfcg1ba545a,3.0,"My first  years with this company were excellent. The pace was reasonable and as low on stress as it is possible in a pharmacy. I managed the employees, handle the paperwork required of a Manager, filled prescriptions, counseled the customers. I completely enjoyed the position until a new manager was hired and he did not like female managers. This was my reason for quitting."
Safeway,1cah3ui2sb890dgi,4.0,"customer service, competitive pricing, versatile work atmosphere.  Flexible hours.  Good employee support.  Clean stores and large variety of products.."
Safeway,1cafn4jabb84r818,3.0,"During the period of time that I worked for Safeway the management was not the best,  I was frequently yelled at in front of our customers who felt sorry for me afterwords. The jobs that I did were not difficult but due to lack of staff there was more pressure put on those of us who were there. The best part of the job was the customers; they were also the worst part of the job.  There were a lot of changes going while I was there which led to people being trained inconsistently or not at all which may have also led to lack of customer satisfaction."
Safeway,1caeobfl7b890af6,3.0,"The company is going through changes, schedules are always changing the is no work/ life balance. The night shift workers are occasionally overloaded, due to lack of management."
Safeway,1caeb4bju1ahi31t,5.0,would love to go back and work for the OR department in Dickinson ND. Work flow was stressful at times and hard to manage at the beginning but after a while I was getting the role of things and work started to become fun and challenging
Safeway,1cae5gdtlb80kdi0,3.0,Generally I did not enjoy my time at safeway although i stayed for two years. It was very easy work and I enjoyed most of my customers. I didn't approve of the management style or really the works atmosphere.
Safeway,1cadujom7brcibsf,5.0,was a good place two work  I worked for safewayfor 11 years it was a fun place two work I work as janitor my job was too clean the warhouse too sweep mop dust wash racking
Safeway,1cadmq9sa5n8i94r,1.0,"Days are typically stressful due to lack of employees and a large work load. The job has taught me a lot, and I have advanced, but the workplace has declined quickly due to poor managment.AWARDS"
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1cablpje9b80kdms,3.0,no room for advancement. Stuck in the same position. Asked for department transfers many times never given. Forced union dues for certain department so you barely if lucky make minimum wage.
Safeway,1cabk4e4i5n8iful,3.0,Responsible for creating a colorful masterpiece of fresh crisp bright fruits and vegetables in an artistic fashion for our customers to enjoy.
Safeway,1cabf26lbb80kec6,4.0,"Was a fun place to work, just wish that they managed breaks better, fast pase work and friendly employees. Great customer service and well discounted products."
Safeway,1cabcgfmkak918e2,3.0,Working there was fine at first until different managers began to pick with certain employees. they cut hours to only 1 -2 days per week. I wouold recieve a $50 pay check at the end of every week.
Safeway,1cab4jg96b80kf3h,4.0,"typical day at work would be busy depends on what time of the day it was, management was alright and the hardest part was doing more things then your job description was."
Safeway,1caacvj711ba703c,4.0,"Safeway provides quality produce and departments while focusing on customer experience. They are exceptional at front end management and friendly, polite."
Safeway,1caa59lguak4hf9s,1.0,"If your looking for stress, SAFEWAY is the place! Bad, horrible, lazy management. Not enough for your happiness. Depressing atmosphere, this job is a nightmare, unfair to every employee. Each manager has there favorite. Do better than Safeway!!"
Safeway,1caa1hklqb84oe0g,2.0,"They gave me a chance and I was thankful, especially for my first job. But they pushed you to do too much fun your 8 hours and discouraged overtime. It was beyond what they should of asked."
Safeway,1caa0a6r01fdv1gd,2.0,Negotiation leave was not rewarding. Needed to take time off but it was not friendly regarding emergency time off. Safeway needs to help their employees in emergency situations.
Safeway,1ca96fuacb80hcm5,1.0,"I didn't enjoy working at Safeway because I felt like all courtesy clerks were put into unfair situations. At times I would be the only courtesy clerk for hours and it would be very busy. Also, I'd be yelled at for not getting at carts in at busy hours, I just had a very bad experience."
Safeway,1ca8qrg840mtu6gs,4.0,This company has provided a lot for me throughout the years that I have been working for them. I have held just about every position within the store and I can say that everything comes with it's fair share of challenges. This company is growing their business within the southeast market and it is providing a lot more entry level jobs in areas such as Florida. Just make sure that you alway aspire to progress within this company if you would like to make a career out of it.
Safeway,1ca8lnla90mtu47e,5.0,"An interesting place to work at for a while. The job consists of doing the assistant work from about 12 to 8 that included, preparing meat for packaging, packaging beef for ground beef, restocking shelves and unloading truck. The end of the day consisted of cleaning the whole meat department to the health and safety standards which usually took about 3 hours."
Safeway,1ca70ieqr0kbu1hd,5.0,"The job was nice in that the hours were consistent, but it was too far from home and that caused me to be late more often than  I should have been. Also, sometimes it could get really slow and that made work boring, I enjoy a more fast paced environment."
Safeway,1ca6rgcgmak8ucm2,3.0,I started there right out of high school and worked 2 years. the pay sucked but the job was ok. I gain many skills and had a pretty ok boss.
Safeway,1ca6hqnkfb84obil,5.0,"A typical day at work is always the same, bagging grocery's for customers and almost always or most of the time walk out with the customer and place there grocery's in there car for them, every 2 hours one or more employee would round up the used carts along the parking lot and push them back into the store for customer use."
Safeway,1ca6fjdd41fdv3qq,2.0,Its very hard to get scheduled hours especially if you have availability issues revolving around a family or children. Pay does not reflect cost of living in area. Severely under staffed.
Safeway,1ca6cqpcu1ba30e2,5.0,I worked with the customers by being a cashier so I worked with money also. I would suggest things to my customers so I had great customer service. I also would sell items thru out the store
Safeway,1ca50d2sj1ai01sk,1.0,It is good only if u are a student or looking for temporary job.
Safeway,1ca4gppusb84mb1f,2.0,place and work was great great co workers and customers were great the only downfall would have to be whne managment changed everything after that was not the same
Safeway,1ca4df62eb84mbrs,2.0,"Safeway is like every other first job for any 16 year old. Even if it isn't your first job and you're an adult. They start you off with a fixed schedule, but stop honoring your availability  after a month. When you call managers to attempt to fix these issues, they don't. After a year, a raise was given, and expectations got worse. Many times one would be alone for 5 hours out the day in their department, without help. This causes breaks and lunches to get messed up, for which you get in trouble for, for not taking them as is scheduled. If you do choose to take them, expect to get in trouble for leaving your kiosk closed during open hours. Coworkers are usually miserable and awkwardly cliquey. A lot of drama.  Ended up quitting."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1c9krbfocaqjs99k,3.0,"I help morning clerk with packaging products, breakdown and put away the frozen load, plus bake product for the day. Make sure crew members are productive and department running smoothly. The hardest is, it's a very high production environment on a daily bases, with a minimal department staff to do the work, with low pay wages."
Safeway,1c9k8i4nlb84jfk5,4.0,I  was in high and it was nice decent money but time to advance and make more money. I would come in and check in and go to my job location and preform my duties necessary for the day
Safeway,1c9iifd611agp4rk,4.0,I would say Safeway has really changed over the years and it’s just not the same at all. As far as management goes it has really changed over the years and it’s not the same as it use to be. I would say overall it’s significantly changed over the years and it’s not the same company as it was 7 years.
Safeway,1c9if95ekakjp8iu,5.0,I saw that the lines was long around thanksgiving time. I ask the manager on duty do they need me to jump on the register they said yes. So I hop on the register and wrong up the guest.
Safeway,1c9if4pmub84jb7f,3.0,Honestly i would recommend this job strongly for anyone looking to better themselves i would go back and work here if i had the chance to do so the pay was fair
Safeway,1c9hv3061b88k8rd,3.0,"Safeway was a fast-pace, customer service based environment. The best part of the day was the customer interaction. This was a great job to learn the basic skills needed to be employable."
Safeway,1c9hqkg28akjpfcq,2.0,Stressful.
Safeway,1c9g10v8u1fdn1s4,5.0,"Great work place. A typical day of work consisted of cashiering, helping customers above and beyond the standards of safeway. Management at my location was not all that good. Poor management at safeway i worked at but i still liked my job."
Safeway,1c9fqqcl9b88kcn0,3.0,"The main issue was that there were often scheduling mistakes and miscommunications from management. I enjoyed all of my coworkers, and many of the managers were wonderful."
Safeway,1c9fko43n0kbq7na,5.0,"completely excellent i loved working for Safeway , this was one of the best jobs i had . it seemed like a family environment. i meet so many family and children . helped customers with all major needs."
Safeway,1c9eu2qdj1fdn7jt,3.0,"Stable job with set paychecks, well-run management, usually well-collaborative people, Union job, job requirements are clear and reasonable. Only set-back was how proffesional the work environment was, too much lack of completing job to the fullest."
Safeway,1c9d3o9q2b88k9u2,3.0,Brick and Mortar retail is a dying industry. There isn't anything that Safeway is doing differently than anyone else. That is the problem.
Safeway,1c9d3cjdcakjp9bs,3.0,Don’t have a social life your schedule changes weekly a lot of people that work there have been working for the company for over 30 years and are stuck in their ways. It’s hard to teach them new things
Safeway,1c9cue333b88kav8,4.0,"A typical day for me at the fuel station was usually full of angst due to the fact that it didn't matter what I had done the previous day, I would still have to pick up the slack of my co-workers daily because they would leave it all up to me due to the fact they knew I was a hard worker and would never leave a job unfinished, even if it meant working overtime. Which by the way because I had to constantly pick up the slack for the rest of the team, I would also get reprimanded for working overtime when need be. However, being from a military background I welcomed the challenge, remained flexible, and truly appreciate Safeway for giving me the opportunity and would gladly go back in the future if the opportunity presented itself."
Safeway,1c9cg8ud8b80oebg,4.0,Great place to work while going to school. It allows you to transfer stores to relocate closer to an area in which you want to go to college. Always an opportunity to move up in the company.
Safeway,1c9c7qb5mak8oer2,4.0,"It was a fun work place , the interactions with customers is an eye opening experience. The people there are collaborative and well trained and every understanding"
Safeway,1c9br1383b80ochi,2.0,"The management always schedules employees to work almost full shifts by themselves with no help. One person can't be expected to do carts, clock in sweeps, bag up front and run everywhere to get locked up products all at once. The pay is nowhere near close to standard with the work expected. So many rude customers and co workers who are too involved with cliques and just backstabbing. The head manager is always on vacation, and literally only shows up for 4 hours, if that, a day. There's so many improvements that could be made to this store to help out the employees and the customers as well, but management is too cheap and too stubborn to do anything positive. It gets worse by the days here."
Safeway,1c9b6a7bhak8ocfa,4.0,The job is good but the hardest part is that work is heavy. People are given an assignment  and you have to finish that assignment  within the time given or on time.
Safeway,1c9a2evbub84j9su,4.0,High work flow with little down time makes for a fast day.
Safeway,1c99mnjh7akjpatl,2.0,Department was horribly understaffed so it turned an enjoyable job into a stress filled nightmare. On the other hand though the employess I worked with were the best of people and they are what made quitting the job so hard.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1c97qf223aqjrb7h,3.0,"The pharmacy at Safeway was great. Schedules were relaxed and everyone liked working with one another. Benefits were only available if you were classified as full time, and many people were classified as part time."
Safeway,1c97jtlr8b88j916,3.0,"The store was in between two managers at the time so the switch was awkward. The original manager had worked there for a long time (a few decades) and was hardly there at the tail end of it. The new manager, and the second in command (who did the scheduling) spent an enormous time talking to customers instead of their employees. Second in command would humiliate some of the employees at front end by raising her voice, over distances, for what should be professional private conversations on a semi-regular basis. Several employees were there simply because they had no replacement, but several complaints filed from their co-workers about them as well as occasionally section managers from other Safeways coming in to attempt to sway employees for the better."
Safeway,1c97h2875b80ndl0,5.0,Working at Safeway has to be one of the BEST decisions I have ever made!  While I was only there for a short while *1 year due to an unforeseen relocation* I loved every interaction I had with everyone there.  I learned so much from my dept and store managers.  I can't praise them any more than I already have.
Safeway,1c97g259sb88jea3,3.0,"Pretty well balanced job, learned good social and life skills. Management was well done for the most part, didn't enjoy taking on responsibilities that were not in my job description, but wasn't too bad."
Safeway,1c97ds376b88je8k,3.0,Its a good job for the starting student. I had no complaints with anyone except my Department manager but this was a long time ago and i still see old co-workers from there.
Safeway,1c963jglkb80id1m,5.0,Very hard work but it paid very well and with great benefits. Some of the management need to learn how to manage better but some were also very well balanced.stressful but worth the pay
Safeway,1c95oppm00kbi1bu,3.0,It is a stressful place to work at. Half the time no one knows what is going on not even the managers. Seniority plays a huge part in how things are done here.
Safeway,1c95m949b1agm436,4.0,This job paid fairly well depending on the department you work in.  they really stress your breaks and lunches.  If you work part time there are not many benefits.
Safeway,1c95670tqb80ia8d,3.0,"Customers would frequently swear and berate me. Low pay, lower amount of respect and appreciation, even from managers and co-workers. No real perks to speak of."
Safeway,1c95533ll1ah91tj,4.0,"A typical day for me was coming in and getting started on making drinks and/or taking orders at the register. If there was cleaning tasks to get done we would get started on them as it became less busy between rushes. i think the hardest part of the job is just keeping up with drinks during a rush. you need to be able to multitask with making at least two drinks at a time and if you mess one up, it can throw you off and you can behind. the management was alright. sometimes a couple of people wouldn't get the required amount of hours for their week scheduled. personally the most enjoyable part of the job was making drinks during rushes. it seems hard but it was my favorite part."
Safeway,1c952mhq81d19180,4.0,Overall I love working here. I love my coworkers. But I don't get enough hours. The atmosphere is good. Typcically it's not a stressful job. However my manager lacks good leadership.
Safeway,1c93d4q1b5j7ieoh,4.0,"Working at a widely known grocery store was like being a juggler. You have your main job, then are asked to help in a different area of the store. Different departments would be short handed and the over flow from other departments would fill in."
Safeway,1c93ar3ut1d0s209,3.0,"My time working at the IT corporate offices of Safeway Inc. was neat.  I learned a lot about desktop support as this was my first job in the desktop support arena. Little did I know that our supervisor was only keeping us around (or was told to keep us around) until after the Y2K scare had come and gone without any of the nightmares happening that everyone was expecting.  All of the full time desktop support techs, but one, were let go on the same day in late February. Later we heard our supervisor rewarded herself with a big bonus for saving the company a bunch of money by switching to contractors.  Mostly the user community folks were pleasant to get along with.  I did get to go to Hawaii to fix some computers there (though I did not get much free time to enjoy the locale)."
Safeway,1c932shpi1d0s3n2,3.0,Overall decent company with decent benefits. Surrounded by mostly good hard working people. Mostly good quality products sold at fair prices. Not the best but not the worst company to work for.
Safeway,1c92numarb80ich6,1.0,"I did not enjoy working at Safeway. The hours were horrible and training was not good either. I felt that they don't care about their employees. Especially working part- time and no raise until you work over 2,000 hours."
Safeway,1c92ihrsbakfkfcn,5.0,I have learned many things at Safeway that i will carry on to other job opportunities. I have learned about working with other and individually in a fast paced setting
Safeway,1c92gep85akjkc8q,4.0,Customer service was key and I enjoyed that aspect of the job. The schedule fluctuated each week so the work life balance was at times difficult due to the lack of consistency. The answers provided in the 'rate this company' are based on the time period for which I was employed by Safeway and not by todays standards.
Safeway,1c92eq4ufakjkejg,5.0,"Safeway was a nice job because I was the stocker, I had freedom so I work at other station in the store as I was done my job and I stacked the shelves neatly."
Safeway,1c923v6jb1d1507c,4.0,Very hard and busy job that I had . Was responsible for many aspects related to my job. Was very stressful st times and more work than one person could do. Responsible fir getting stock fir the freezer in the deli which was a huge responsibility with little time to do this task
Safeway,1c91k7djc1fdg6r6,3.0,"Fast paced, lots of customers coming through the checkstands. Bagging groceries. Physical and mentally demanding job. Dealing with conflict resolutions. Diverse cultured co-workers. Management communication needs lots of work on work ethics. The hard part of this job is the physical part and mental part. Be prepared, it can be stressful on a daily basis. The enjoyable part is you get to meet all kinds of people from different walks of life. From your co-workers to your customers.  The part you enjoy is your nice friendly customers that you established yourself with.  They keep coming back to you and making their day awesome."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1c90vfghi1fdg7k1,3.0,the company is great . the hours I worked were overnight graveyard and they just didn't work out for my schedule. but anyone looking for a long term position with a grocery company this is great if you stick around.
Safeway,1c90pg4421d0s26f,4.0,"The Vons that I worked at was amazing! I loved my store managers, Even after the switch. Terry was always looking out for us. Never had a problem. Working for his company was one of the best things I've ever did."
Safeway,1c90lh83a1d0s7vo,4.0,Through out the years at safeway there have been an abundance of job oppertunities that have been of valuable importance to growth and experience. Really great experience overall.
Safeway,1c90jtsvl1d0s7q6,3.0,*slow and fast depending on time of day
Safeway,1c906f1ca1d0s5bt,2.0,"They don't like people getting to full scale pay, so they try to find anything they possibly can to get you fired. They're even willing to hire a private investigator to spy on fellow employees on their time off."
Safeway,1c9066n6f1d154q0,2.0,"While the people I worked with were okay, the management left much to be desired and scheduling was a nightmare. You get crummy pay for working what they want you to do and there was a lot of turn over."
Safeway,1c901aehf1fdg37h,5.0,Safeway was a wonderful work experience. The management always works with your schedule and open. Other staff are friendly and easy to work with. Overall a good company
Safeway,1c8vmud6u1ah958a,4.0,"safeway is a place that will accept you with open arms, its nice calm and relaxing. Working at safeway will give you the real world experience you need"
Safeway,1c8vlgqsj1fdg2fn,4.0,Learn your cashier system quickly to have the best interaction with the customers. Show up on time keep busy when the store is slow and smile. The more friendly you are the better you look for the bosses. Everyone is nice and you meet new people everyday.
Safeway,1c8uin0jgakjjcvs,3.0,"Working in cut fruit (which is in the back in a very cold room) was fast paced, but a fun experience. I learned how to make parfait, salsa, guacamole, pico de gallo and many other delicious things. I had to properly wash, cut, package, and weigh a certain amount of fresh fruits and/or vegetables per hour before taking it out to be displayed for customers to buy. At The end of the work day my co-workers and I worked together to wash and sanitize everything in the room including the floor. If you want work hard and behind the scenes this job is definitely for you"
Safeway,1c8tuqm8j0kbi768,5.0,loved co workers and management. enjoyed working just didn't like the stress of cashier position. would recommend to anyone interested in a first time job
Safeway,1c8tfl1b91d0s0it,3.0,management does not back their employees and does not solve problems. the work that is asked of you in an 8 hour period is more often than not way more than should be expected of 1 person.
Safeway,1c8t581iuakjjefo,2.0,The hours changed every week and usually were 20 to hours.  The hours changed every week and many times would drop to the minimum of 20 hours which is difficult to live with to pay the bills.
Safeway,1c8rc2387b80if68,1.0,"This was the worst place, that I've ever worked. The ""Upper Management"" was aweful, other employees were nice and we got along really well. We went through more Management than regular employees."
Safeway,1c8r7k6bp5nfra4l,4.0,Easy but hard working job. Get to communicate with people all day. Was able to learn about the necessary things you have to do when working at a grocery store.
Safeway,1c8q0vemn1d120vn,3.0,A typical work day at Safeway can be stressful at times depending on the day or month. It’s great talking to everyday nice costumers and giving them good costumers service. Must have high patience and great costumers services to work at Safeway in any position. Management has grown from when first starting in 2014 but could still be improved on greatly. Favoritism can happen discreetly. Hours are often low. Doesn’t provide full time in most cases. Hours are sporadic.
Safeway,1c8osvo9b0kbi1kh,2.0,"Its has a lot of disrespect ,calling u dumb and stupid this stuff come from manager. I came in with experience gave me minimum wages. I enjoy helping the customer. If u call the office to let them no u have emergency the whole store knows your business."

Safeway,1c8mf5g2t1d0s1qg,4.0,You must be able to multitask and get as much production done as you possible can to make sure that we have everything we possibly can to insure customer satisfactory. Must be willing to work efficiently hard to be able to give great customer service
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1c8lhcrd31fdg11e,5.0,one thing about this job that i liked was the people that i met coming through the door always made sure they always came back. i would recommend this location to any young person who is social and loves new faces.
Safeway,1c8lfdth15nbue9e,4.0,There is never a dull moment when I came into work. There will always be work to be done in the deli department. I worked 8 hours straight with no breaks.
Safeway,1c8lf0fvg1d1227u,4.0,"I worked the graveyard night stock crew, they helped me get into the swing of things quickly and were very polite and helpful. Good staff and good people."
Safeway,1c8l6tanp1fdg4nu,3.0,"Very business like, most don't leave their offices or cubicles. Communication could be better. This could be due to high expectations within a very competitive and changing market environment."
Safeway,1c8kaffif1d0s246,1.0,"Expectations always above hours allotted. Only option is to overwork/kill salary employees. Ridiculous amount over oversight from district/corporate/merchandising teams, all giving different ideas and focus to individual stores."
Safeway,1c8k0rda71d0e47r,4.0,Working at a grocery store is a never ending job that requires quick fulfillment of repetitive tasks while accomplishing customer service. It requires a fast pace and a service first attitude.
Safeway,1c8jt79jgak7ucod,5.0,"Great environment to manage, really community involved. Lots of opportunities to problem solve.The hiring staff was really professional and helped me a lot."
Safeway,1c8jgmgc41d0o6es,4.0,The deli was really hard to keep up the speed but once you take your time you understand and come up with other away to help you better yourself. I would say the cleaning was the the part for me. Cleaning the deli had to be done a different away everything the steps on how to clean.
Safeway,1c8jfq9bhbrftacb,2.0,"The job is actually pretty repetitive. If it wasn't graveyard shift, I'd prolly be still working here. I learned so much tho. Like being keen with details, organize and honed my stamina as to constantly moving. The lady manager doesn't give you a chance to work on your own style (she wants you do things on her way) Please hire 3 more people in your department. Hard to tag all the items in all the aisles in each department if there's just 2 people. Have all  work at the same time."
Safeway,1c8ja8a25b8bv8lc,4.0,"Every time I walk in the store to clock in nothing but smiles, Learned everything from being a clerk to being in the deli and in the meat department, management are always very good to their employers, hardest part about work would be would five dollar Fridays, Most enjoyable part of the would be getting all the work done for the day!"

Safeway,1c8j5f90ubrftchp,5.0,Safeway was a great place to work with lot's f fun employees. The management is amazing and were really great and understanding of my situation when I left. I would definitely recommend Safeway as a great first job and possibly a career.
Safeway,1c8iu4umpb8bvf3d,2.0,"worked early mornings , a lot of things needed to be done like breaking down the the daily load and working the product out. The management was a little poor, any problems that needed to be solved or dealt with by management never got done. Workplace culture was alright as long as you were nice to your fellow co workers"
Safeway,1c8imvcbjakjgakl,5.0,Working for CHI gives the opportunity to develop skills and its people (co workers and management) are very friendly and accessible
Safeway,1c8im6a191ah673t,2.0,job was not fun based off the company culture and communication. supervisors always stressed by senior management therefore it trickled down through the team.
Safeway,1c8ih88po5nbqf1b,2.0,"Good place to work for college student. The pay is ok, but the advancement is minimal. It takes at least 6mths to be full-time, but you have to get excepted as a full-time employee, so its not guaranteed. It takes a while before you can reach a $20 pay."
Safeway,1c8h451g35j7feeh,3.0,Assisting customers as well as guiding employees to perform tasks to better assist the front end. I learned how to write a schedule. The job is relaxing and easy going as long as you do the work that is assigned.

Safeway,1c8gn7tdsbrft9or,3.0,"Hours range between 20-40 depending on holidays and your position. Management is pretty average from my experience in other retail chains. They're usually understaffed making work harder for the employees that are there. It's been five years since I've worked for them and they where aquired by Albertsons a few years ago so my knowledge is somewhat out of date. I have a friend in management at one of the stores who keeps me up too date on some things. Management pays very well. Regular associate positions do not. Safeway wasn't the worst experience I've ever had but definitely wasn't the best. They do offer advancement it's pretty rare though, as well as typical benefits like paid vacation after one year and healthcare. They are union and it's a requirement."
Safeway,1c8gm47vpbrftbvl,2.0,Where can I safely it was a new experience. I got to get a handle of cash handling and as well as getting along better with the customers. I think it would be a better environment if the managers were very nice.

Customer service was extremely important which was easy for me since I really enjoy talking to people and helping them out. Working in the Produce department was challenging and fun as well. I lifted heavy boxes and stacked them in the coolers when a truck load came in. I arranged the fruit and vegetables in a visually appealing manner. I cleaned shelves, swept and mopped floors. I got to work in the check stand everyday as well which was enjoyable and fast paced. Management was always pleasant to work with. Working for Safeway was very team oriented."
Safeway,1c8ds10sa1d0j1l0,5.0,"Family has worked here since the 90's, I have worked here personally twice. Great company. Take care of employees well and pay decent livable wages! I would come back to safeway any day!"

Safeway,1c8djc4jdb8br8i4,4.0,Starting in Courtesy Clerk can trap you into a position. Good courtesy clerks rarely are given option to move up by upper management when Departments show interest.
Safeway,1c8dgcp4d1ah05e5,3.0,This was my first job. I have mixed opinions about this establishment. I didn't work here long enough to develop a negative opinion about this place. My coworkers were cool.
Safeway,1c8cet5tvbrfpbr6,2.0,"I have worked with Safeway for 28 months (a little over 2 years), and I am only making $11.80 (the minimum wage for my area is $11.50). I have been trained for a variety of different departments, and I have been told my fellow workers and customers that I am one of the best workers in my store, but yet I'm barely more than minimum wage. It's unfair and I need something better. It's a decent job if all you need is some money to get on your feet, but don't count on getting promoted and getting raises."
Safeway,1c8cb8dd7akfd9tn,4.0,"Interacting with the customers is great. Attention to detail is very important, how the customers like their groceries bagged to how clean the front end of the store is to how many items a person needs when assisting them with getting their groceries."
Safeway,1c8b37rnjak7pde8,3.0,Worked here in college and it was a good job for the time. Paid decently but definitely not a career type job. Never enough employees working at the same time and employees are overworked.

Safeway,1c88hqm0d1d093u3,4.0,Store is okay. They got some good stuff that people needs. But I guess the team/management or some individuals who work there get so wrapped up in our own responsibilities and our own job that we don't see what other people do. Then you have people that do nothing at all. Lack of team work
Safeway,1c86iqe7bb8brd6q,4.0,"enjoyed working at Safeway, i managed several of the meat departments throughout the bay area and also done several remodel grand openings throughout the bay."

Safeway,1c8404o025nbmfk0,3.0,"On a typical work day busy at times other times it is slow. Management could be better, The cultures very here. Hardest part of job I would have to say is doing price changes overnight as the store is open 24 hours so it's hard to change prices because there is always customers around."
Safeway,1c83dc2tv1ah03mb,2.0,"Typical day was working in the gas station, some days working in the store at the register. Was generally called to the register when there wasn't enough staff.Not a career choice but it was a job. Better than Walmart."
Safeway,1c82tfcbdakfda99,1.0,Not enough help! Then you get threatened if you can’t finish your work. Too many chiefs! Not enough Indians! Management knows nothing about the business.
Safeway,1c81tk08pbrfkfgv,1.0,"I enjoyed my job and helping customers with what I could, only down fall for me was lazy employees picking up slack and rude employees. I enjoyed my time while I was there and made a couple friends."

Safeway,1c80n67221d035s6,2.0,The deli manager that I had was a total dink. She would tell me to do three tasks and expect them all to be done right that very second. She wanted them all done at the same time. She never helped customers and always asked someone else to help them even if they were already busy.
Safeway,1c7vio13n5nfhf6i,4.0,Working for Safeway was very good. The company is great. I work lots of overtime. Great coworkers. I love the bonuses that I received. The management was not very good.

Safeway,1c7ug6h7b1d0354q,3.0,"I have worked for safeway for almost three years now, the main reason i've stayed for so long is because they have good benefits, they are flexible with scheduling and there is a workers union. Management is shady most of thr time, they will try and screw you over on breaks, and not to mention the customers can be really crumby."
Safeway,1c7ufogvcbrfk9db,5.0,I like leaning new trades .I love leaning how to cut beef and the parts of the animal that have the best flavor .Like the porterhouse .Also love leaning how to clean the fish plus farmed fish or fresh .Over all I leaned about the meat and seafood how to respect he cuts and health benefits .I will carry this info the rest of my life.

Safeway,1c7riblpebrfedij,4.0,I genuinely enjoyed working at Safeway for the time that I was there. We went through a few managers in my time there but for the most part they were fairly nice but near the end they wouldn't give me time off that I needed or wouldn't give me hours that I was available to work.
Safeway,1c7redpeqb83rbdn,4.0,This job gets repetitive but it is simple at least.  Theres always something to do but it's not really that difficult or challenging so it can be easy but also kinda lame at the same time.

Mainly leading up to be a head bookkeeper. I worked close with management and very close with customers. I always made sure there shopping experience was above and beyond what they needed.

Management cuts hours and they expect to keep the same production numbers with less hours. When you present ideas to management to improve production I was ignore. Management is always stress out and screaming at their employees. Safeway needs to invest in some management classes for their managers. This has been my experience working at Safeway Located in Clayton Concord, CA. zero employee appreciation."
Safeway,1c7i8u3c2brfeb7m,1.0,division with union reps and company issues rules always changing company sets expectations way to high for the employee. managers are rude and cut throat.

Safeway,1c77h2iueak7ceh6,3.0,The company eventually evolved to care nothing about people and only on results. Expectations became very unrealistic and at times impossible. Employees not treated as people but numbers. Company thrived on making everyone scared for their job every day and relied on threats to get results. Horrible work life balance and no appreciation for loyalty and good leadership.
Safeway,1c77amreuaqj5cjs,1.0,"Management never did their jobs correctly, often putting their jobs onto others. Communication between staff and managers was awful. Often it would take going through at least 3 people to get a simple task done."
Safeway,1c74f84d2b83jfct,5.0,"My experience with working at Safeway, for my first job can I honestly say it has taught me every skill I need in the real world and for other work. Benefits are great! Flexible! Everyone works as a team."
Safeway,1c73ar6tfbrf7egu,4.0,"Great job to start off with, people are friendly and customers are great most of the time. They are a great company to work for just wish they had more opportunities for growth within their company.  They are great at giving their employees time off for school when needed or for personal reasons. Definitely a fast paced environment."
Safeway,1c724mqg8b8bac1o,2.0,"They need better management and to learn to follow laws and their """"rules"""" for safeway. When i worked their they didnt know how to do any of that and then some"

I have been a loyal employee for almost 12 years. Iv been done wrong by Safeway an the employees at the  rehoboth beach de Safeway location.
Safeway,1c70gm1lfb83j8ac,4.0,"they are a great company but i will not work there again. The store i worked at; the management was horrible and did not communicate with their staff, there was so many miscommunications that could have been avoided if they would have just sat down and listened to what people had to say."
Safeway,1c70b50pmb87gc5i,4.0,Apparently the only people who get a break are those in the smoke shop. Nobody else matters as they are the laziest ones in the stores.
Safeway,1c709g48hb8bab2h,5.0,Safeway was a good company I enjoyed the money and also the benefits of going to the gym and movie tickets I couldn’t figure out how to use. The discount on food was ok as well and the free employee gifts.
Safeway,1c702gcncb8bae2s,4.0,"Working in the bakery consisted of looking in the cases and determining what I needed, then pulling those items from the freezer and/or making them myself; decorating cakes and cupcakes either with generic designs or following custom orders made by customers."

Safeway,1c6vh59obakj1ffd,3.0,"Many different job titles and typical day varied depending on position. Learned much about the grocery business, especially about inventory.

Made some great friend with fellow coworkers."
Safeway,1c6vdi38hbrf79fn,3.0,"Safeway is an okay place to work. Be prepared to have a workout. Full time employees work from 6:30am-4:30pm. Lots of lifting, and customer service skills are much needed."

Safeway,1c6t58oi2aqj3dh3,3.0,Pretty laid back not too hard of work the managers could have been a little more professional all around. Super clique-y so be ready to make friends or be alone all day there is no in between.

Safeway,1c6nkttcg5nf2a15,1.0,I had an awful experience working here. The managers didn't communicate with each other and got mad at employees for doing what another manager told them to do. One of them didn't know I'd handed in my notice and tried to teach me new tasks on my last day. Employee retention for this position was terrible which often meant I was the only one working on some days. Customers yelled at me for cleaning the other gender's bathroom when no one else was available.

Safeway,1c65i2ipdb82u96f,1.0,"Everyone who works there for a living hates their job and hate the corporation. The company will do anything to save a few dollars at the employees expense. If you're a younger person who is doing this just as a first job, you will be paid minimum wage and then on top of that you will have to pay union dues to a union who does absolutely nothing for you, so you will essentially be paid under minimum wage."

Safeway,1c63o8cpk5j6e8ls,1.0,"I've only worked at one Safeway location in Junction City so my opinions are based on my experiences at that location not all Safeway locations.  The store has no business being open. They changed management almost every 2 months. None of the manager s had been trained to do there jobs. Weekly schedule was posted whenever management decided to post it, and multiple times They changed the schedule in the middle of the week without notifying employees. They don't rotate product. Always found product still on shelf after sell by date. They make night stock crew work the product that just came off trucks first and then the back stock. (Should be other way around)  The Union doesn't care or back the employees. My Union rep was also part owner of the location I worked. It's only a matter of time before that location gets in trouble cause they sold spoiled products and someone gets sick or worse. After bringing these issues to store managers I had my job threatened. I then went to corporate and was told to talk with the Union. The Union rep and I talked about the issues. He responded by informing me he was one of the people that own the location and I needed to get over it or find a new job. The next week I showed for my posted shift and management posted a new schedule and I was given the week off and told they were cutting hours and I should start looking for other work. They never put me back on schedule after that.  I go to work to make money if the house is making money then so am I because then they can afford to give me a raise. If the costumers are happy then the bosses are"

Safeway,1c6339d1jb82ue0n,2.0,"Safeway was my first real long term job I ever had. Management was decent but there is no work life balance, always expected to come in and drop everything when someone else calls out to cover shifts. Always expected to go outside your job description with no acknowledgment or pay increase. And they top you out at $20 an hour which they make extremely difficult and time consuming to get to."
Safeway,1c62p5o7tbrenbfm,5.0,"Great company, plenty to do.Must stay organized to keep up.Management is always willing to listen and help which creates a positive atmosphere.The hardest part of the job is making sure you stay on top of everything. The most enjoyable part of the job is finishing each project on time."
Safeway,1c62fcponb8amb0v,3.0,"Simply put, there's no room for advancement at this job for drivers. I've been on for almost 4 years and still have around the same pay. They start you at 15 and you'll stay there for a while, no bonuses or anything.  Every time you ask for a raise or try to see what the next steps are to advance, you get shut down. You feel a little unappreciated because I seen people steal from this place, flip trucks over, Etc and still have a job here. And here I am working my a** off with the best customer service with no accidents and I can't even advance. It's not even fair. My coworkers are great and that's the only reason I stayed at this job for so long."
Safeway,1c61ukfvab8am8ck,1.0,Management pretends to be oblivious/turn a blind eye.. whichever works in their favor. They're cutting labor but expect the same output. Employees work off the clock to keep numbers up. We get written up for working overtime. Don't ever be a front end courtesy clerk. The senior staff make it a point to degrade you. This job doesn't pay enough for that kind of treatment.
Safeway,1c61srl5qb82uflg,1.0,People were unfriendly. Never enough hours. Customers were rude. Manager was always behind and taking stress out on employees. No benefits and had to pay way too much for union.
Safeway,1c612jd27b8ama72,2.0,"I've been with Safeway for 7+ months. It was a huge change from my previous job (Lowe's) since there were new things to learn, like weighing produce, looking up produce, etc. I also learned how to process eWIC, SNAP, EBT Cash, etc. The hardest part of the job would have to be customers getting angry that we only had a couple cashiers available, and the store was packed. Theft was also a huge problem because of the neighborhood I was in had a homeless shelter right across the street."

Safeway,1c5rdjdk8b86rbu6,4.0,"Pulling out load up to 1500 to 700 pieces, unloading it, then stocking items to the sales floor, then facing the store after stocking, the hardest part of the job is when you have to cover other people slack like when you have 15 aisle in the store and your doing half of the store stocking, and facing with a core group of 5 to 6 people"
Safeway,1c5ra0gjhb8am816,3.0,Safeway is job that gets better the longer you are there as long as you have a good work ethic. Also you need to very flexible as you go to get hours. If you cross train then you make yourself more valuable. Sometimes management can project unrealistic expectations but it's on you on how you react. If you prove that you know what you are doing they leave you alone. Yes it all depends on department  and head management but if you talk to them regularly it works.
Safeway,1c5prrahvb8ag8cl,3.0,"I applied as a barista with the schedule of a barista. First, they decided to cross train me. No problem. Then they kept using me as a clerk instead of a barista and added later and later shifts outside my availability.

They cut corners and do everything they can to get the most worked hours out of you while paying the least amount possible.  When they rolled out new patient services, pharmacists were required to go in on off hours or days off to perform the services for 3 hours (because any more than that would require premium pay.  On top of that, premium pay, is less than time and a half).  They would cut technician hours left and right, micromanage inventory, and force you to work when you have legitimate medical needs.  STAY AWAY!!!"
Safeway,1c5p1pm9r52uca7q,5.0,Work at Safeway was great. The atmosphere of the workplace made it enjoyable as well as the staff. The customers were great and I enjoyed the location of Safeway.

Safeway,1c5mskofdb86k82q,2.0,"I never worked at a place where I felt so disposable. Management was often very condescending towards their employees, and coworkers were often very rude."

Safeway,1c5m7jnb9b82k9dc,4.0,Safeway was a good job and I was disappointed that my union representative was not helpful in solving the situation that resulted in me losing my job. I feel that profits are more important than employees at times which did lessen the joy of working.
Safeway,1c5m2pk3c5naaagd,1.0,"Always busy,  work never appreciated. Food workers union did not work hard enough to better salaries or handle employee's complaints. Very high employee turn over. Poo management at store level."

Safeway,1c5khkpdfb82fe8i,2.0,"At the location I worked at, the store was busy during the holidays and the weekends since it was close to the Mexican border. Parents would let children run around the store, when they make a mess the parents won't say anything and this sort of thing happened a lot. The boss doesn't have a good reputation, the people I worked with would say he doesn't know how to socialize and he acts cold to everyone, no one is sure how he got his position in the first place."
Safeway,1c5k8746pake3f4r,3.0,"The store offers a wide variety of food and goods, and the overall cleanliness is above average. There is opportunity to learn a variety of skills and trades."
Safeway,1c5k5ms8db8ab865,4.0,"-A typical day at work usually meant running carts, bagging at the registers, go-backs and cleaning."
Safeway,1c5k0lj72bre7afb,4.0,"Alright company to work for, very relaxed and laid back. It's a grocery store so there's no sales goals or upselling. Management has to change out end caps every week with promos so that can be a bit tedious."
Safeway,1c5jv32gobre788s,4.0,Rough location hard to work with the public there. I like the company good and bad memories. I would say its a good first job not much room for raises though
Safeway,1c5jtnmdq5ne6b49,3.0,"On a good week i get 30 hours at 10.50 an hour. I have 3 cases with my name on them and the work piles up. As it does, so does the stress. My particular store is a black hole. All drama all the time. No stability. No room for advancement. Onve they find where they like you, dont even think about moving up in life because you're trapped."

Safeway,1c5ha75j8ake299o,3.0,"Very repetitive days as a cashier, lack of enthusiasm at work made for long days. Management was lacking and could have been improved.  The dress code made it very uncomfortable  to stand all day and was very restrictive."
Safeway,1c5h2c6fiake2cqn,5.0,"I have been there a short time as of today but the whole crew is friendly and supportive.  Everyone works together and helps each other.  Fast paced job and always busy and jobs to do.  I am still learning which is what I like.  I enjoy the customers and trying to make their day better.  From the time I walk through the Pharmacy doors I am working at non stop.  There is always something to do from data entry of new scripts and insurance, answering the phones, checking a customer out, stocking medications to so much more."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1c5gfijp7b8abd7p,1.0,"I was the only decorator employed for most of my time there. Others were variously hired, but none had experience and there was no way to do all the work myself and training someone that had zero experience. After holding the position for almost two years alone, they finally found someone with experience as my backup. Then they started giving her all my hours, and when I called my union rep, the store manager told me that as long as I had 1 more hours than her, he was within the counselors. I was the senior decorator, so I got more hours. He didn't like that I called the union, so he gave her my day shifts and wanted me to work the late shifts. That didn't work out with my family very well, and it also didn't work well for her schedule either. She quit and I started having health problems."
Safeway,1c5fnd547b82fdrs,5.0,"I learned more than a lot from working here. As much as communication skills, customer service, and making arrangements. Overall I am very happy that I got hired when I did, because I grew up a lot and learned a lot of life lessons."

Safeway,1c5fcbo5sb82fev7,3.0,"In the beginning, working at Safeway was a wonderful experience, but as the management positions changed and new people came in, it soon became corrupt. The original management group I had been employed under were very compassionate to those who were starting their first job. I have many good things to say about these people. But as management changed, the new people were far less than compassionate and borderline abusive to the customers and staff. Most people were working 6-8+ hours a day balancing school and work, on top of this there was extremely limited break time and many of the employees were denied enough time to eat, take a break, or relieve themselves. The management group also played victim when an employee had to call out for being sick, often forcing sick employees come into contact with food and many customers during their long shift."
Safeway,1c5f87fd3b86e8qi,5.0,The manager and I connected immediately. I enjoyed the connection with staffing. I liked the location. And I liked the benefits. The work experience was pleasing.
Safeway,1c5etfd3lb82f99s,3.0,"I really did like working at Safeway. Yeah sure on occasion when the ""big-wigs"" would come through for a store walk everyone was on edge but would collaborate together and make the store look fantastic. The customers are typically regulars so you gain a great rapport with them. Not to mention the deals they had in the meat department on ribeye steaks!!"

Safeway,1c5c3j95makafet6,1.0,"You can only get fired within the first 3 months if you are not working up to expectations. after the first 3 months... then you are in the union and you pay union dues.When you are in the union u can only get fired for stealing, not doing your job tasks. the old contracts for employees were better than the newer ones, By them saving money did it benefit the newer employees? Its a good starter job."
Safeway,1c5aaugk3b86e9j1,1.0,The worst place ever. The manager was awful. The company paid you practically nothing. I hated every moment of my life. Soul sucking. You have been warned.

Safeway,1c5a2hauibre79q1,2.0,"Bad management. The deli manager and Asst. manager would always call out sick or show up to work when ever they felt like it, and would leave whenever they felt like it. Employees would constantly call in sick. Bad management = employees who don't care about their jobs. That's why I only worked there for 3 months. This job was not a good fit for me."
Safeway,1c59un93cb86ee8g,3.0,"The management there could be way better.  They don't care about their employees, they don't pay fairly, and they are rude to customers.  I would not recommend this job to anybody."
Safeway,1c59mat3qb82fchr,3.0,i was a deli clerk and it was the worse food service job I have had in my entire working adult life. Staff was nice but the environment was stressful. Felt like I wasn't properly trained or given enough time to be trained.

Safeway,1c5923op0b8abe75,3.0,"The union made this job worth it because it fought hard for it's members and made sure the pay they got was reasonable. Working in a store is rough on the body if you are a checker. You will hear the same thing every day ""If it doesn't scan it must be free"", you will deal with sometimes angry customers, and sometimes very shy or scared customers. If you like variety, and being active, go for a job as a checker. Safeway isn't a bad company to start out in."
Safeway,1c57usfosb8a8e2f,3.0,Super chill and you'll get comfortable fairly quickly. The job was pretty mediocre and was very systematic. Coworkers made the job enjoyable. Management was okay.

I have never in my life been treated by any employer the way I have been treated by the management at Safeway. I am extremely disappointed in my experience there. I guess this is the trend at Safeway, since I have heard the same thing from other friends who also work for Safeway at other locations."

Checking inventory, stocking shelves and also working at the cashier. store was open 24/7. We all worked as a tam. Made it fun but also staying focus and determinen with deadline orders to avoid shift leads from stressing or worrying about what the store manager would say or comment but in the end we all understood the job and never had a ""lazy"" co-worker.

Safeway,1c4nm2t7jb89veki,5.0,I loved working at Safeway I enjoyed talking with the customers and feeling like we were a team. I'd enjoy working there again I think my co-workers made it enjoyable too.
Safeway,1c4nl74d8akhofn0,2.0,- long work days
Safeway,1c4nhmfoib81uf9n,4.0,"Great job to get back on your feet, but not a good job to have as a life long career. My hours were always irregular and I never got a full 30 hours a week, 24 hours doesn't pay my bill so I needed to go elsewhere."
Safeway,1c4nbg0al5j5kfud,3.0,"Most days are really busy and sometimes we do not have enough lines open. I learned how to handle a cash register properly, floral arrangements, and the preparation of fresh fruits. All coworkers I have worked with were nice and respectful. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the long lines, the most enjoyable part was working in the floral department. Management was excellent when I first started working there, but the longer I worked there we had multiple come and go to work as regular front end and store managers, some of whom had little knowledge of what was going on in the store."
Safeway,1c4n8afv05j5karl,4.0,"fast paced, sometimes slow. Balancing out different customers and how they day went to determine attitudes. Kept me busy and moving around. Good hours."
Safeway,1c4n852d1aqhpack,1.0,"I would not recommend working at safeway I didn't like the way I was treated. I always had to work holidays, they would never give me one off when I asked for it. I didn't even get to have my birthday off of work. The management is terrible and was the main reason why I left."
Safeway,1c4n7v35saqhpecs,2.0,the management was terrible- rude and lazy. made the employees pick up on their slack. The hardest part of the job was closing the store at 11:30 and having to finish homework by 12am and I would fail my assignments because the managers would not work with me on my schedule. I was a full- time student who was an athlete also and they were terrible with that.
Safeway,1c4mvev5r5n9l94s,1.0,"Safeway was my first job. I started from the bottom as a courtesy clerk straight out of high school and worked my way up. When I was hired, the company used to stand behind you and generally took care of its employees. It's not like that anymore. Ever since the merge with Albertsons, the company has been sinking lower and lower. They expect you to work harder with less hours and constantly tell you that you're not doing a good enough job. I wish I were exaggerating. And cooperate backstage adds more workload than any one person can handle. Ever since I moved to Oregon, I have had terrible managers who do not take care of problem employees and do not help you when it is needed. I even had a manager tell everyone that he hated his store and thought we were all worthless!! I might be over stepping my boundaries but I am no longer loyal to a company who has literally killed hundreds of peoples spirits. I have never seen a higher turn over rate. We are always short staffed but there are not enough hours to go around. I went from having 30hrs a week to 24 to 18. And it's not getting any better. Half of the time when we hire people, they walk out on their first week. We rarely ever get people to put in their two week notice. They might pay good, have career advancement, and benefits, not to mention paid vacations but to me, it's not worth it. I've worked for the company for 12years and am topped out in pay and am willing to take a pay cut just to escape the miasma that is Safeway."
Safeway,1c4lruc4daka0csp,3.0,"the company has dress code, code of conduct, fast paced, flexible work schedules, management is inconsistent, employees are by and large friendly. The customers can be hard to handle at times but management is very supportive in this area."
Safeway,1c4lra92db85teb0,4.0,"It can be a fun place to work but for the pay I definetly need something better, everyone has fun there but if you aren't getting paid enough or getting enough hours you need something better."
Safeway,1c4ljb6n0b85tcjb,5.0,Safeway pharmacy was an extremely innovative company to work for. Unfortunately the laid back California management style was taken advantage of by too many and the company suffered.
Safeway,1c4lio1m4akdlc96,3.0,"You have to love what you do, other wise if you work like others you may feel not worthy at your job. Sometimes employers  favor others with no work ethics than the guy who hauling at a fast pace, another words stick to yourself don't worry about other people."
Safeway,1c4lht2nsb85tb3n,5.0,"I was in the front of the store and in the bakery department. I learned how to take initiative during stressful situations because they encouraged employees to work alone. The management was fair and very helpful. The workplace culture was great, everyone was friendly and there was great opportunities for advancement. The hardest part of the job was working alone because there was usually a lot of work to be done. The most enjoyable part of the job was having good and nice people around to collaborate with or even just a friendly conversation."
Safeway,1c4lbaqfvbrdndii,4.0,"Safeway is a great first job with encouraging co-workers. It was  pretty busy most of the time so I always had something to do which I loved. My favorite part of the job was giving carry-out service to customers because I got to have one on one conversations with  them and really get to know the customers more. The hardest part of the job was pushing carts in bad weather. While working there I got to learn the store pretty well which made it easier for me to help customers. I also learned how to work with other people which made the job less stressful. Before I started working at Safeway I was pretty anti-social, but that soon changed overtime since my jobs purpose was customer service. Overall, the workers and customers were great which made it a pretty good first job."
Safeway,1c4lag252aqhpafu,3.0,A typical day consisted of sorting out the routes to be dispatched to the drivers. We had to dispatch drivers to make pick ups and deliveries to various Safeway stores and vendors.
Safeway,1c4l4boavakdleno,5.0,"It was a great job and great company to work with. Everyone was always friendly, it was like a big family. I would go back if the money was right. A great company to work for."
Safeway,1c4kvpsaab85te5k,1.0,My hours fluctuated from 12 at night to 6 am start and would work anywhere from 5 hours to 12 hours depending on the work load or lack of staff. Was never given the staff i asked for to complete the job that was assigned and hours were allocated to the department. Had to take calls weekly on days off about issues and how to fix them. Pay raises didn't happen unless you threatened to quit
Safeway,1c4kq1qb0ak5t9u7,4.0,"Working for Safeway is all about customer service, The emphasis on this only increased over my time there. I found that most of the people I worked with truly enjoyed working there which made the job enjoyable for me. Most management teams were fair to all."
Safeway,1c4kp6q4qbrdna6a,5.0,"Room to grow and be prompted within company, excellent benefits. Heath care is excellent. I've enjoyed working for Safeway/Albertsons for years, I hope to be offered a position in great falls as I've relocated to this area!"

Safeway,1c4j79ev0b81uftn,1.0,"The job was stressful, because of the manager of the department was never following regulations or health codes for the most part and I tried to follow them as best as I could to make up for his lack of effort in them. The manager would blame other people for his mistakes."
Safeway,1c4j37envb85t97u,2.0,love the people i worked with but the managment is otherwise. the management does not seem to care about you well being or sanity and then get mad when you dont meet standard with sub-par equipment
Safeway,1c4is925bb85t8hq,4.0,"I worked at safeway for four months, the management is understanding and willing to work with you, the pay is fair, benefits are great if you intend to stay and pay your union dues, and as long as you keep busy the day goes by quickly. The customers are the worst part of the job but grumpy customers are few and far between if you are polite."
Safeway,1c4iqo04sb85taqh,4.0,"You can be easily undervalued by management but it is good to meet lots of good people and hard workers, you can be the hardest worker and not well recognized at the same time which gets annoying if you're trying to get something out of working hard. Hardly appreciate your hard work."
Safeway,1c4ifok5lb89ravh,4.0,Fast-paced environment with friendly people.  There is a lot of competition among departments.  Competitive nature can come off as hostile at times.  Friendly management staff.
Safeway,1c4i6v28tbrdna3a,3.0,"Simple job for any high schooler wanting money, progression is possible but takes a long time, they dont give you a lot of hours for being a courtesy clerk but I took what i could get."
Safeway,1c4i447pu5n9l9eu,1.0,great to work with the public get to know a lot of regular customers most of the employees are great to work with mangement showed a lot of favoritism
Safeway,1c4i3r8r2b89rdg6,3.0,"While working at Safeway, I had to earn my seniority (about 8 months of working there) to be able to have more than 20 hours per week."
Safeway,1c4i207sobrdneu4,5.0,good great time the people were nice great benifts good pay nice cowokers the work was fast pace that just made the time fly faster would reimend this job
Safeway,1c4gua1fkb85taum,4.0,Compensation and jobs benefits are really good as you work so many hours you get good health care dentistry and paid vacations which helps out a lot where every employer wants
Safeway,1c4gqcggobrdian3,4.0,Used to be good to work for but then staff hours while number of customers increased had made it undesirable. I dislike the secret shoppers evaluations (waste of time).
Safeway,1c4gideqkb81ofb0,5.0,"During a typical day, I would start with vehicle inspection of my truck for safety hazards and to prevent risk on the road. I would then take inventory of load and ensure that the load is secure and within DOT regulations. Shortly after securing load and ensuring safety I begin my day on the road. I've learned that time management is crucial in ensuring the load gets to the grocery stores in a timely manner. The culture at Safeway is fast pace and at times demanding. One of the hardest parts or inconveniences of the job is time delays, whether it is delays coming out of the warehouse or traffic delays. I enjoy most of all the ability in work collectively with my colleagues, i.e., dispatch, and store staff as well as having independence of being on the road."
Safeway,1c4gf7hcsbrdia72,4.0,"Hardest part of job was not giving proper instructions on time, Management was great when working with them, Proper training would help. Most enjoyable part of working there is that you get to meet new people and learn about all the different meats and product they have,"
Safeway,1c4g7448makhj86r,3.0,build great relationships
Safeway,1c4g4q7eaak9r8ar,3.0,Safeway is a great place for work. Opportunities exist for person from all walks with any level of skill. With plenty of room to learn the business and gain additional responsibility.
Safeway,1c4g0qdstbrdidqk,4.0,"If you're a student looking for a part time job, they provide flexible hours within the store. The bakery atmosphere has a lot more work, but you don't have to deal with as many people."
Safeway,1c4end1i45ndgblg,4.0,It is a nice company. Give or take minor details just like any other working establishment. You come in and work according to what your position is and the day moves right along.
Safeway,1c4eavrtcb85megn,1.0,"I liked working at safeway at first but after 3 years and absolutely no raise no opportunity for advancement. This company will literally try to work you to the bone. Overworked for nothing but a min wage job and broken promises, management too afraid to deal with any issues regarding a department"
Safeway,1c4e7ore052tk9cu,4.0,"Days at work was great. Everything went smoothly day by day. There was always work to be done whether it was assisting others. I learned a lot of new skill that improved my experience. The workplace was neatly maintained, organized, and filled with kindhearted employee's. The hardest part of the job was changes within the bakery due to new management. The most enjoyable were my co-workers working hard to get our jobs done while having fun at the same time."
Safeway,1c4dog1vuakhjf2m,5.0,"Great environment, and plenty of overtime for whoever wants it. Great people and boss, benefits, and job security, and perks that come with the job, discounts at the stores as well."

Safeway,1c4dijkmjb85m8si,1.0,"Safeway over works its employees and does not compensate them to keep up with the cost of living. This companys favorite trick is to promote an individual, then delay their increase compensation for the promotion. They will state they do not pay or offer back pay."
Safeway,1c4db7caaak5nber,5.0,I really enjoyed working for the Safeway company. The pay was great and management was amazing.
Safeway,1c4cvklfmb89l89b,1.0,"Working there for almost a year at ""full-Time"" i only worked 2 40 hour weeks out of a whole year. sometimes my hours dropped to 8 hours a week and their excuse was they couldn't afford more hours for me even though literally everyone else got 32 to 40."
Safeway,1c4cav8lib85mcvn,4.0,"I used to work in cut fruit in the produce department. I had a lot of fun with the people I worked with. However the work was tedious and the store manager was incredibly controlling and a little crazy. I got paid minimum wage, as did everyone else in produce who wasnt a PIC or Manager. Plus, union dues SUCK. When you're making minimum wage, having even more money taken out is a real buzzkill."
Safeway,1c4bbq1rnb89lern,4.0,"Safeway overall is a pretty decent company. working in Arizona can be difficult due to its a right to work state. the pay in my opinion for the job duties, respect and loyal-ness i've had for the company for 11 years is not what i think it should be. meat department is one of the more challenging departments to work in because every aspect  desires the upmost dedication and detailed-ness. not everyday is the same but for the most part if you have a daily plan and stick to it, you can work stress free. workplace culture is fairly decent, most employees get along like family and most dont. thats just how life is but you must remain kosher to the people you deal with on a daily basis and remember you are all there to reach a common goal."
Safeway,1c4adn5vub81o970,5.0,"Check coin mags first to make sure all registers have plenty. Do pick up at each register, count it, book it, and put it away. Audit drawers when needed.Wait on customers while doing office work. towards end of shift audit fuel station, Start breaking registers, counting, and setting up for next shift. Count lottery , do deposit, lockup everything up and end shift."
Safeway,1c48uegrub89le8t,3.0,I like how fast paced my job was. The customers that came in were usually very kind and nice to talk to. The only downfall was that the store I was working at only scheduled me only 4 hours a less a week.
Safeway,1c48rgg54brdibrq,3.0,Union job with great benefits. comp is low and is time consuming to make raises in pay. Had an okay time while working there. depends on the location of a great experience.
Safeway,1c48pa407b81oedc,3.0,"They give the drivers a lot of freedom, besides mandatory lunches. The GPS follows your movements and speed, so its better to follow the road rules. The manager was fair, until you got on her bad side."
Safeway,1c48ie7l2aqhk89p,4.0,I worked here through college and it was a great experience. I met a lot of nice people and developed a strong work ethic. Safeway accommodated my college schedule.
Safeway,1c48dtgj1b81odlf,5.0,easy and fun place to work at. employees where great and always had a smile. I would recommend this place to work at to any one. this was my first job and helped me advanced myself in the work force.
Safeway,1c47vc5lrb81o8kr,2.0,Manger was not fair had poor management. As a new employee was not given proper training. They left me to close alone without me having a clue of what I was actually doing and they would complain in the morning about the things that I could not get done because I wasn't sure how to do them. My co-workers were great certain ones at least so when I would work with them I would learn alot more. The location I worked at is now shut down due to poor management and sales.
Safeway,1c47oket4ak5nded,5.0,safeway was a good company. when i left they were going through alot of changes in management. i think the grew a little to fast and had to take a step back and figure out what got them where they where today
Safeway,1c465mp13b81obc5,4.0,Working in the deli was hot. Especially during the summer time. I did enjoy helping customers and making food to put in the hot case. Or cutting ham and cheese for people. Helping customers made me think it wasn’t so hot after all and helping people is something I love to do
Safeway,1c46587hbbrdi83q,5.0,"A typical day at work is eventful. You get to see people of all ages, religion, and even political views .  What I've learned from this is the workplace culture is like a family, and so is management. The hardest part of the job is in a way the most enjoyable part of the job."
Safeway,1c45re6nvb89l8sv,4.0,"in the bakery there was alot to do each day, had to maintain food prep conditions, customer service, daily prep of next day product , had to bake goods all day keep the product stocked."
Safeway,1c45pd6ecbrdici6,5.0,"Employees were fun to work with, liked helping customers, cashiering. Lots of work to keep busy within your day, very clean workplace. Was let go due to company buy out."
Safeway,1c45llnkr52tkbuv,2.0,dont reccomend anyone work here .......managers come and go all the time training is horrible and they treat their employees like garbage its also a union company and the union doesnt do anything but collect your dues
Safeway,1c45k8n8t5n9gf81,4.0,I work as a Personal Shopper in Safeway's Dotcom business. My day starts at 5:00 am. My job consists of filling the online orders of each given day. I log into a machine that tells me what the customer wants along with the information of whether or not they are willing to take a different item if the one the desire is out of stock. After all the items are retrieved I set them up to be delivered by our delivery men.
Safeway,1c45hcesvbrdiarq,4.0,"A normal day at Safeway depends on the department you work in. I was lucky to be able to work in several departments. Everyday is a learning experience because you never know where you will be in the store during your shift. Working there is a fast paced environment with very little slack time which is a good thing. Store managers are hands on, meaning they are not in their office all day but rather out on the floor working along side you, keeping employees busy."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1c45esudtb89lakt,1.0,my typical day at work at safeway was super stressful. working at a grocery store is always going to be hectic whether its busy or have loads of shoplifters through the day.
Safeway,1c45blu07b89lf26,5.0,I learned most of my skills from Safeway.  Work life balance can be a bit challenging because of the demand of the job.  Overall I am happy that I worked for this company.
Safeway,1c45abgnrb81o94d,2.0,Looks like working in a grocery store everything that you do is working in the grocery store because it's a grocery industry you have to know the grocery industry
Safeway,1c457pa5tbrdib2m,3.0,Safeway Inc was a wonderful place to work before Albertsons merger April 2015
Safeway,1c457n73cb85m8b8,2.0,"As I progressed in Safeway, sometimes everyday would be different. Sometimes I would be in the check stand as a cashier, or id be at Starbucks as a barista, on the floor as a day stocker, or I was training to become Customer Service. It gave me different things to do everyday which was refreshing. The hardest part about my job is that I was doing a four person job and not receiving the hours or pay for it. Four departments and was only receiving 25-30 hours when I have completely open availability. Hearing the customers complain about things to completely agree on; the store being dirty, over crowded with merchandise, short staffed in every department. Nothing would ever be done about anything."
Safeway,1c457fearbrdif8e,1.0,Safeway is a poor company to work for ever since Alberstons took over. Management is more concerned about making payroll and controlling expenses than driving sales and building the business.
Safeway,1c457f6l0brdiagf,5.0,"A   very   friendly   and   calm   place  to  work   at.   I liked   it  a lot.  managment  is always professional, and staff is friendly and helpful."
Safeway,1c455dg4nakhjcte,2.0,it was fine at sometimes but others it's hard to keep up with they are askin you to do. But that's when you have to try harder to keep your manager happy so you can get more hours. But some managers you have to be careful with.
Safeway,1c452490bakdgd61,5.0,I learned how to work in a fast pace. In Safeway I prep the salad bar & sandwich bar. When I make cold sandwiches for the customers they were very satisfied .The hardest part is if everyone not doing they job and it becomes slow.
Safeway,1c43sndp4b89jdc4,3.0,This is a good place to start working and gaining customer service/cashier experience! A typical work day had it's busy times and relaxed times. At the end of the day I was very tired.
Safeway,1c43iqda0akhh9sv,3.0,Once you're hired they think your life is safeway and safeway only. The customers and employees in other departments make the stress all worth while the managers are rude and expect you to do everything in and out of your job description without explanation.
Safeway,1c43h2it55j5d9sg,3.0,Management could've been better. The lack of communication helped foster a stressful environment. There were mix-ups all the time between managers and team members. There wasn't a cohesiveness amongst the managers and it played out amongst the team members.
Safeway,1c4384lei5n9edfe,4.0,On a work day it was very fast and time just flew by.
Safeway,1c436cpn1ak9pdm4,1.0,Extremely Stressful with varying ideas of how the department i was in should be run. miss communication was very common. as well as word of mouth rumors while the person was not on shift
Safeway,1c436aoqqbrdffkc,3.0,"Safeway has become increasingly disappointing as an employer due to cutbacks in payroll that result in reduced hours. Quality of service and sales have declined. As a result, employee morale seems to consistently decline and it becomes more difficult to recruit new hard-working, qualified employees."
Safeway,1c42vflnib85kf9s,2.0,The management now that Albertsons has taken over is  out of control... bullies!! Our hours have been cut almost in half. We have unhappy employees and customers. What was once a great family focused company is nothing more then a corporate black hole. Don’t expect to make any kinda living wage... no hours!!
Safeway,1c42u9bb2brdfd4j,2.0,"Safeway is a very good company to work for. Great hours, pay rate & days off. I get along just great with my co workers, I love dealing with customers on a daily bases. I go above & beyond to help out my co workers, customers, I stay over time when asked."
Safeway,1c42s7pk1b81mdqp,3.0,"The hardest part about the job is from week to week not knowing what to expect on number of hours given and it can rapidly change depending on the time of month, or time of year. Do not depend on a consistent schedule, time of day always fluctuates as do days off."
Safeway,1c42r2g39ak9p8ud,3.0,nice place to work but the pay isn't all that well but the customers and the employees are nice people to get along with. The hours can switch weekly as well.
Safeway,1c42o7cqi5nde8kf,1.0,the job itself was a good job... the upper management was the worst I have ever seen in my life. the merchandisers from various departments were always disrespecting the employee's and treating them like they didn't matter. Over my career at safeway I have witnessed people crying from how bad they get yelled at from merchandisers and high up the totem pole employee's who just seem to belittle people.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.

Safeway,1c41ia0d9b89jaut,4.0,"I loved this job with the exception of the culture of Safeway is more important than anything in your life. I am a very dedicated worker so that didn’t get to me too much. However when they took the Deli managers out the union and took away their benefits, I had no choice but to leave."
Safeway,1c415jambbrdfapr,2.0,They do not care to keep employees that make more then minimum wage. Its a revolving door of new people because many quit and get frustrated that its nearly impossible to move up or make a wage you can live off of. No consistent hours which makes providing for a family tough.
Safeway,1c40d3fclak9pd4s,2.0,"I would go in and clean the bathrooms, and take trash out. I would have to take back product not purchased. I would then go and collect the carts in the parking lot."
Safeway,1c408kv7tb81m9cu,2.0,Unfair treatment by management. They do not treat employees like they are appreciated. Small chance of advancement if any for the employees who work hard.
Safeway,1c4087v17aqhidio,5.0,"courtesy clerk was a fun job in my opinon, i was able to be helpful with the customers and my employees, some days were pretty difficult but pulling/pushing shopping carts in extreme contitions (snow, wind) wasn't a simple task, but the managers always were grateful and appreciated the hard work. Fellow employees, regardless of age, were always kind to me. tasks that were asked of me were as simple as restocking, facing labels of producks to make the isles look nice."
Safeway,1c4076k0uak9paca,3.0,"This company is a great place to have a first job. It teaches you hard work and perseverance. I worked here over a year and the Co-Manager and Supervisor were awesome! There were a handful of co-workers with a positive attitude like me, but most of them were negative and some of them were very vulgar to boot."
Safeway,1c3vm4p6l5j5dc6c,4.0,"It's   nice place to work, for a start if u are in school, flexible schedules and time to relax and has a workers comp which  I personally didn't like"
Safeway,1c3uoljsvb89jf1u,5.0,"Just like any grocery store u walk into. U never know what the day will bring or the people you see. Yes there will be drama, but that's work. I try to avoid confertation. I get the job done and go home to my family."

Safeway,1c3u6qopsb81g9qv,2.0,"There is a reason the employees call Safeway, Slave Way. Of course different stores may treat their employees differently but my experience was demeaning."
Safeway,1c3tp7ktbak5fbci,3.0,Its a good company to work and they treat their employees fairly. Work hours are flexible although its union so seniority is the basis for growth in the company
Safeway,1c3tot5b1akd9bks,4.0,working Safeway deli is a headache some customers don't care how much you have to do or can't understand that sometimes items run out and us as employees don't have authority to do certain things. Other than that its very fast passed
Safeway,1c3tohuvqb81gbe7,3.0,"I have worked at several stores in two different counties. I had a total of six managers and worked in 5 different departments with different titles. The culture is really set by the mangers and since they change so frequently be prepared to be flexible. Room for promotion depends on the location. In South Orange County promotions were handed out constantly which is awesome! Great learning opportunities. In Riverside County not so much! The only way anyone was getting promoted is if someone quit, was terminated or retired. I learned so much from this company at my original store and I wish that I would've never relocated because I would probably still work for this company. Benefits are great, better for the old contract people. Paid holidays are great, if you are under the old contract. The customers were usually pretty great. The worst part was working nights 4pm-1am 4 nights a weeks, working 11am-8pm Saturday and Sunday and having to work every holiday with small children at home. The schedule changes weekly and you are paid weekly. Great job to start out with or work through college."
Safeway,1c3to2q6tb89ddbf,5.0,"The job is simple, just load up all groceries into your truck and go, drive safe and get to your destination on time and you will not have any trouble."
Safeway,1c3ticfmbak5f9ug,4.0,"I enjoyed almost every day working here. my co-workers were kind and wonderful people who always went out of there way to help create a wonderful work environment. the managers were easy to talk to and trust to ensure a safe and productive workplace. the hardest part of the job was never knowing how customers were going to act, thankful I learned to adapt to situations and learned to talk to management if it was inappropriate or went too far. the most enjoyable part were the regular customers who came in and always treated me kindly and with respect, making my day better if I had a rough start."
Safeway,1c3rqvhh35nd7c16,2.0,"in the beginning i work a lot of hours, and when the project ended it was hard to make 40 hrs a week the craft were very good to work for and they all work well together"
Safeway,1c3rq92k7brddfml,1.0,"Management is sneaky, shady, and could not be trusted. I was lied to more times than I can count. No one backs you up, not even that lousy union they have. Stay away!"
Safeway,1c3rkmvkvakd9d5b,4.0,"A typical day at Safeway for me is clocking in and then going to the manager on shift to as where they want me to be at that moment or who to take over for. I'm a checker, so i scan people items so they can pay and that's what i do the entire shift and you get a few breaks depending on how long your shift is. The management at Safeway is really well organized and they are nice people. I learned more about customer service."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.

Safeway,1c3nl91mtb89ddkl,2.0,"Had a man that was 20 come in and ruin things by saying he would work on backstock then end up not doing it. He also took credit for our work. Higher management was completely hands off, leaving us to our own devices even when we needed guidance. They would often get angry if the ridiculous loads were not finished on time as if it were even possible"

Safeway,1c3k6sqa1b89d8l9,2.0,"There are never enough people to do the job, and they work you until you refuse.  There is no longer a customer focus to the store and it is not about the customer.  Management is more concerned with what you have done for them versus what you have done for your customers."
Safeway,1c3k6d01sb85ffme,3.0,"So I dont know how things are recently but during my time I gladly kept to myself and rarely make returns to the store, its not the worst job but it was very odd."
Safeway,1c3jn1qvfaqhcadu,3.0,Hour where never consistent never got enough hours. The management would never work with you in a emergency situation. Enjoyed employees. Was not far from my house.
Safeway,1c3jmf12qb89d87i,5.0,Safeway schedules are never the same for most employees. You won't know your schedule until they post it. Most stores everyone gets along. Some departments are harder than others. They celebrate a job well done with pizza but if you aren't scheduled for that day then you have to come in on your day off.  (Dumb) It is a great first time job or good if you need a flexible schedule.
Safeway,1c3jkkci2brd8bvf,2.0,The customer service aspect is challenging. Great place to work if your looking for a job to do while you go to school. Unfortunately my hours have been reduced by 40% facilitating my need to look for a part time job.
Safeway,1c3jjohvcb85ff2f,5.0,"I joined Safeway as a college graduate. Within a year of me working there, the managers had trained me into a seasoned finance professional capable of complex reporting mechanisms and armed me with the knowledge and know-how to take on financial challenges head-on. Incredible learning experience and awesome company with strong financials."
Safeway,1c3jgpforb89d8d8,3.0,This company does not give employees consistency with hours to support their families. The communication is terrible on a daily basis as projects change almost weekly but we are not informed. The hardest part of this job is keeping employees motivated who get treated very poorly.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.

Safeway,1c3irs5flakhcf4a,3.0,"The work environment was fast pace and a fast learning system, the management wasn't very good at helping the team but when they did the work place was steady."
Safeway,1c3i3apbub89d8t8,2.0,At first I was put in Starbucks and I told them this was my first job ever and they said I wasn't feeling it and I only gave me four hours and said they didn't want me anymore. Then I was a courtesy clerk for five months and that was alright and then I was moved to bakery. At first I was the packager which was alright and then as I multi tasked I started baking and doing other duties. I am always productive but this job becomes very stressful. They never increase your pay rate like a co worker worked at Starbucks and only makes $12 which is two dollars over min. Also Safeway never shows appreciation for how much work you do they keep wanting more. They will literally drain you and make you feel like your nothing. They will say don't do overtime but will want you to get everything done with isn't possible because the list of objectives never ends. Also if you work in a department you can never request days off. I got five people in bakery and me getting a day off I want is impossible. Overall its a decent job for starters and can cover some bills but not the best job out there or very reliable.
Safeway,1c3i0nu31b89df12,2.0,Unfortunately my work experience here was far from pleasant.
Safeway,1c3hqppvdb81890c,4.0,"Working at Safeway, I learned customer service skills, working as cashier, stocking, helping customers locate items they were looking for, and money handling. A typical day at this job was between slow and fast-paced, I was constantly helping customers with locating items or just checking them out at the register. The most enjoyable part about the job was being able to learn all the different skills I was able to pick up on. The hardest part of the job was that the management wasn't flexible so it didn't work around my schedule when I needed it to."
Safeway,1c3h76iu8b818e35,3.0,"I was in the job for some money so I could afford living while at college. I never got the raise I was promised every 6 months, and the union did nothing for me but was required anyway, so I was losing the 35 dollars to be a part of it every month anyway. The hours were changed every week, and they were good about working around my college schedule, but the other employees called in so much you often ended with more hours than scheduled. They did pay overtime, but I got in trouble for staying after a couple of hours because of how busy it was, because they couldn't afford to give me the overtime pay."
Safeway,1c3h2uqmuak9eesk,5.0,It was hard working there but you get to learn from other and helping getting at something that you didn't know how to do they help you with that when you needed it.
Safeway,1c3h22ir1b818fj2,5.0,I worked in the bakery. It was fast pace and made the day go by so quickly. It was an awesome team to work with but the pay wasn’t good for all the work we had to do.

Safeway,1c3gs14dhb857av2,5.0,Working as a fuel attendant at Safeway was one of the most rewarding and wonderful jobs I've ever had. My manager was fantastic and real. As long as you fulfilled your duties there was always a shift to pick up and hours available.
Safeway,1c3gq8068b8189da,3.0,Safeway was an ok place to work for the hours were Spit Shift and Safeway would Cut working Hours at anytime.The manager was kind of different with an attitude of if you dont like the hours then leave.
Safeway,1c3gouqfe5nd2e6a,5.0,This job is cool. I come into work. No one bothers me and let's me do my job the best efficient way I know how. I would definitely recommend anyone who likes to be around produce to get a job there in the produce department.

Safeway,1c3f6hsk45j53cg3,5.0,"I started off as a order selector ,which included filling orders for shipping to the stores.  After a while I learned shipping and receiving or working on the docks loading or unloading trucks.  Then I became a forklift operator, which involved putting stuff up in the racks 50ft  high,  Twice a year we did inventory of all the stock in the warehouse or quality control. Management was there to guide us and to make sure we did our jobs correctly and accurately.  The hardest part of my job was the hours sometimes.  Well probably the most enjoyable part and that's with any job is getting paid. We also had union reps to settle any disputes that arose on the job site or within our workplace."

Safeway,1c3egd1j3b818foc,4.0,Company does not put huge importance on the happiness of their employees because there is such high turnover. More concerned about your ability to do the job at the current time than keeping you long term.

Safeway,1c3d4qme0b818dc0,3.0,"This was my first place of employment and it was great for learning customer service and training in various other departments such as the bakery, produce or meat department. All my supervisors were great and willing to teach you so you can advance within the company and gain experience. In my area and during the time I worked there they even had a union which is a plus. The only downside was that the hourly pay rate was a little dismal and during slow times hours were cut. All in all I found this company to be a reasonable and decent corporation to be employed for."
Safeway,1c3d2a1cub818cjk,3.0,"Night stockers refill empty shelves with merchandise, usually from around 8 p.m. until the early morning hours of 7 or 8 a,m. They visually inspect retail areas or read inventory reports to determine what to add, open and unpack boxes from storerooms and warehouses, and sort and arrange items where customers can reach them. If they discover damaged merchandise, they inform their supervisors or managers, and set them aside for repair or replacement. They must record their activities so inventory records are accurate and up-to-date. If stored inventories of items run low, stockers inform inventory control staff so items can be re-ordered."
Safeway,1c3co999qb8159ag,3.0,I floated to several Safeway Pharmacies around Oregon. I liked working different locations and meeting new people all the time. Sometimes it was a really great day and sometimes you just want to do your job and get out of there.

A typical work day was very pleasant and stress free. Product sales were very good with excellent quality. Being in charge of the Quality Assurance Department, the highest legal and safe  quality of product were manufactured at very affordable price for all our customers. Employee turn-over rate was very minimal due to the professionalism and high hourly rate of pay for production employees. All production and quality control employees were very dedicated and committed with excellent pride in their jobs. Benefits were all intact, Medical, Dental, Vision  with stock options and 401K."

Safeway,1c3bn064pb89498h,4.0,A good starting job for kids in school or a decent side job when money is needed.  Management does not always seem to care for it's employees but not at a level where you won't get paid for the work you put in.

I worked in the Floral department. I pretty much ran that department even though I was not the manager. Worked in the bakery, GMC and did whatever the manager ask me to do.  I work at Safeway for over 5 years and the management was terrible."
Safeway,1c367gtk2aqh2aa5,2.0,Management at this store was very bad.  Hours per day were always less than 5.  They promise more hours but would hire more employees and cut every ones hours so they didn't have to pay benefits.
Safeway,1c3514cr0brcrcao,2.0,A typical day at work as a bakery clerk consisted of providing customer service to the public and handling inventory in the department. The management and culture of this grocery store was the best part of the job. It was a very friendly and supportive environment. The hardest part of the job was that only one person handled multiple tasks at once during closing shifts. I learned that the grocery/food industry is a fast paced environment but much fun to work in.
Safeway,1c350sgqlb853cr3,2.0,was hired as part time and was scheduled 30+ hours a week.  Closing shifts left me too tired for school and I was often scheduled at the same time as my classes.

Safeway,1c34db5jt5j4qdql,2.0,"Biggest problem is that no matter how hard you work, how hard you try, it is NEVER good enough.  There is no corporate support/help..  You never feel you are succeeding. Store morale is horrible.  Everyone is frustrated & miserable  but they stay mainly because of the pay, because we DO have a great group of people that we work with, and because jobs are hard to come by."

Management wants everything done, but you get reprimanded if you work any overtime."
Safeway,1c33gjhpi5ncqa9c,4.0,"I would say  that my work day was productive and busy depending on what day it is and what promotions that were going on hit can get crazy busy. I learned to multi task more effectively and to be more patient with customers and my employees,"

My job was to maintain store operations within the departments, and tracking sales daily, and reporting on our daily, morning also evening conference calls. Reporting to my boss (Store Manager) in the morning when I walk the store when she arrived to work was an essential part of my job, reason being I was able to talk with her about things that night crew either did not do or things that I could tell were not completed the night before. Even though Safeway could get to become a stressful work environment it was easy to maintain the positive moral by continuing to encouraging my employees of a job well done, which reflected in our CSAT. (Customer Satisfaction Survey)"
Safeway,1c31m0eejbrcreu6,3.0,"The job was okay it didn't stand out much. Co-workers weren't driven as much as others and it added onto my work load often. However, the job did help me become more detail-oriented."

Only problem is they do not offer full time to anyone but journeymen. A typical day consists of bickering from customers and other coworkers. Long time workers for Safeway are often feel entitled and take longer breaks and work less because they have the top pay then the workers who have only just started. Some management are easy to work with, others not."
Safeway,1c300vjtfbrcrf4h,4.0,Great first job for some but definitely wouldn't keep for long term. Very understaffed and i was always asked to stay late.

The customer service was the Number 1 Priority. Safeway at times also was a little bit stressful, the amount of workers there were in the deli was not very sufficient which resulted in lack of customer service. There was not always enough workers due to low sales, but we also had low sales due to being understaffed. Safeway was really good at explaining and teaching you as you go along, although sometimes you may be stranded in left field depending on the amount of customers. Overall Safeway was a wonderful place to work at."

Safeway,1c2t8jslk5n8qd52,1.0,"I don't know if it was just me, but my Safeway got shut down, and I absolutely hated it. The management team was awful, they would get mad at you for no reason, had no acknowledgement or reward for the hard work that was being done. Clueless about everything going on in their store. Most of the things were expired, and they gave us useless jobs to keep us occupied because there was not a lot for us to do. No proper training was also given."

Safeway,1c2t4j9debrcrcts,3.0,"I liked working with the customers but the staff was treated a little poorly and they did alot of seniority type problems, the gossip was too much. I also couldnt handle the way the managers belittled and talked down to staff"
Safeway,1c2t2p0p3b88uf1b,3.0,"At first as a pharmacy manager, I had the dream job. I knew all my customers by first name and they trusted me as a valuable source of knowledge and a health-care provider. I excelled as a pharmacy manager and was propelled into becoming a regional pharmacy manager. This salaried position often included me working 70+ hour weeks with little work-life balance. The culture is overall negative. Most Safeway employees do not enjoy their jobs and the direction the company is headed (less hours, more work)."
Safeway,1c2sdvbe9b812dnv,2.0,"Working at Safeway I was required to join the Union which had several fees I was unaware of, including fees that were taken out from each paycheck.  I also did not receive enough hours."
Safeway,1c2scprjaak50f70,3.0,"I was trained in 3 different positions at Safeway, bakery, floral and cashiering. Bakery taught me how to work very efficiently and in a clean area. My hours were 2 am- 11 am, they were brutal, probably the hardest part of this job. I worked with intelligent ladies who had been working the bakery for 20+ years and they taught me a lot of what I know, I definitely learned how to manage my time with many tasks. I enjoyed being able to take a lot of pride in my delicious product I was supplying for my guests. I transferred Safeway's due to a move, and I was then trained in the floral department. I had one of the best managers in this department. I learned to put a personal twist into some of my arrangements with talking to my guests and hearing about what they are going through or celebrating and I could create a beautiful product for them from my heart. Cashiering was very fast paced and not the best training, luckily for me, I have cashiering training (was a bit rusty, but I trained myself for the most part.) I appreciate my time with Safeway because I learned a lot about myself and my work ethics."
Safeway,1c2s5fhkpbrcra2p,5.0,great place to work but it was time for me to move on. I wanted to move to Alaska and at the time there were no Safeway stores in Alaska. I wanted to see the entire country
Safeway,1c2rucuaeak92b4f,2.0,No manager knew what I was suppose to be doing and everyone of them told me different things to do and not to do certain things when another manager was there
Safeway,1c2qg1i0sak928o2,3.0,You learn a lot of things in this company but it’s very hard trying to be promoted and grow within the company. Expectations are truly highly expected
Safeway,1c2q4c5atb88ufng,2.0,"they were THE worst, the managers didnt care about anything except the higher ups getting on their case, the coworkers didnt really care either and would throw you under the bus most of the time without a second thought, and everyone talked behind everyone's back.  i also dont like the ceo, not bad at her job (i think, could very well be wrong, never learned much about her) just rude"
Safeway,1c2q2rqmib812eop,4.0,Safeway was a good place to work. I was a barista in the licensed Starbucks store there and the work environment was healthy. It was equal work shared by two to three people. It was your average grocery store job.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1c2pue9s8b88u8l8,2.0,This year that i worked for safeway was a good one the overall vibe of that time working there was great. coworkers were nice and knew how to treat customers and coworkers nice.
Safeway,1c2ptqa5ib853dld,4.0,"Chances for advancement, fun work atmosphere. Managers were usually good, they came and went fairly quickly. Full benefits. Paid time off. Paid sick leave."
Safeway,1c2pcimjlb853a1i,3.0,"Its ok, as a driver the work is not too bad, unless you are in San Francisco in which case it is a hard job. It is great to be by yourself delivering, this I really like."
Safeway,1c2p0i3qq52sre57,5.0,Very good benefits once you get them. Union job so there are dues taken out of your check. I enjoy the job for what it is. They are pretty flexible with hours too
Safeway,1c2oblrsvb850a7c,4.0,"Each day was fairly similar. Do your work and go home. Maybe socialize a little. I learned not to share too much personal info because people like to talk. Overall a good place to work although a bit unprofessional. Hardest part was others socializing and not focusing on work, making my workload increase. I did however enjoy the friendly workers and customers."
Safeway,1c2nj31vlb88u8nv,5.0,"Worked with great people great benefits, very flexible hours, I really enjoyed all aspects of working for Safeway. The only thing in the beginning was the union dues were a bit much."
Safeway,1c2mhjmbtb88u9cb,3.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed the physical work provided at Safeway, however, the delivery model does have several issues. This structure has created an impossible setting for advancement, as drivers that have been with the company the longest make more than most new employees will ever have the chance to make. A $0.40 raise after a year of work is not nearly worth the time, or the effort provided to advance. Veteran drivers will keep lower level employees from advancing by forming an alliance and falsely/misguidedly reporting to higher authority. On top of this, there are no immediate supervisors which is both a blessing and a curse. You can be doing an impeccable job with this company and no one will be there to notice for the entirety of your employment. Unfortunately, the best way to get ahead in the company is to initially be horrible at the job and then get better over time, rather than being impeccable and impressive during the entirety of your employment. I found this to be my main reason for leaving, as I was unsatisfied with the way I was treated as an employee after having worked diligently and tirelessly through a 120 degree Summer season, and then some, all while attending school full time. It was never enough for Safeway, and my work was never recognized financially or otherwise. They seemingly paint a beautiful picture for new employees as to make them work diligently for benefits/higher pay/advancement. What they don't tell you is that your job/pay advancement is not dependent on your quality of work. On a positive note, if you are looking for a short term job, this is"
Safeway,1c2lqkklsb80u8s3,2.0,"At first I enjoyed the positions I was working, however after a year and a half of hard work and not taking vacation or sick days they still refused to raise my wage above minimum. Even upon promotion they refused to pay anything but minimum wage."

Safeway,1c2kthh64ak508g7,5.0,Safeway is a nice place to work and the people are friendly. I worked at a lot of the stores as I was a pharmacy tec and had to travel to different stores due to shortage of help. Nice place.
Safeway,1c2kslcuab88ubfi,4.0,Work is fast pace but you get credit for a job well done .Management is understanding on days off needed .Get to meet a lot of people work indoors cool when its hot outside warm when its cold outside.
Safeway,1c2kk3g5pb88u8ta,3.0,Good company that gives you hours if you need them. Good benefits that also give you paid time off once you earn them. You get personal holidays and sick pay
Safeway,1c2k7mocqakgscns,4.0,"I love working at my safeway starbucks. I have a great team, amazing regulars. However there isn't in much way to advance or acquire more hours. Our team leader is new and she is doing well, but there is still room for improvment. Also safeway starbucks do not get the benefits a standard corporate starbucks recieves. So my options for furthering myself in starbucks careers is very limited."
Safeway,1c2j1nn6pb850e6l,2.0,"Poorly ran, poor pay (always taking large fees from paycheck), scheduling was extremely poor, and overall just highly disliked the job. Managers would say certain things, and not hold true to there word."
Safeway,1c2iq5n4sb80ucpj,5.0,"great company to work for, I was in high school at the time and playing sports so I could not keep up with the hours I was given. It was a great first job"
Safeway,1c2iis9pj52srfam,4.0,"Great colleagues and management (if you were lucky enough to get a manager that cared about you). It is retail with slim margins so that navigating budgets and constant budget cuts, and changes in direction made it challenging."

Safeway,1c2dmqjj7b850d58,4.0,I worked as a cashier.  We rang people's items up and handled some reviews.  Our store was very busy most of the day and usually under staffed as well.
Safeway,1c2dhdpqdb88ufhk,4.0,"I worked at DotCom department in Safeway so the shifts started at 4 am. It was really a great temporary job because it fitted my school schedule and them willing to work with you on the hour per day you wanted to work. The job is fairly easy, you come in every morning and pick items that the customers placed online and get ready for it to be delivered."
Safeway,1c2dg0j9vb88uflk,3.0,"I am not implying that I myself, am super intelligent or ""too good for the job"". I am simply describing every person whom I worked with and observed. Seriously, a chimpanzee with 'Downs Syndrome' could perform the tasks that ""management"" performs on a daily basis, with ease (I might add). If you encounter a person whose name rhymes with ""Bet"", show them a little sympathy, they are a decent individual deep down (divorces and 18 years of smoking can really get to someone)."
Safeway,1c2d690hqb850ar7,4.0,I worked in the bakery and it is a lot of work. Thankfully I worked with a lot of nice people who were extremely helpful in teaching me everything I needed to know. Everyone worked together really well and everyone helps each other out.
Safeway,1c2d32b3pb88ubmi,1.0,It started out well but management plays too many games. It's only a .50$ raise for managers so it's not worth your time to advance. And if you decline a manager position they mess with your schedule
Safeway,1c2c29cmeb80uabr,4.0,"This is my favorite job so far, because I adapted very well to the work and people, did very well, got lots of help and training and loved my co-workers!"
Safeway,1c2bmi2cpbrcqbhe,3.0,My typical day would start by going to the register and staying up there until I had to go on break. It would be really busy all the time. Customers would always be rude to you if they didn't get anything there way. The hardest part of the job is always being on your feet and always going to break and lunch late and always get dinged on if you were late.
Safeway,1c2bkbdg0b88u8ri,2.0,I would never work there if I knew how it was going to actually be. They could care less about the people that work for them. There is no plus side to working there.
Safeway,1c2at9iqqaqgvffj,3.0,"Great place to work but the salary its very low.  takes a long time to get promoted,  My manager was great but some of other managers were a unfair.  I would come back if they paid a little better"
Safeway,1c2an1ctnb850b7i,4.0,"High Paced dealing with customers and people......Good company with quality employees and management.  Flexible hours, and consideration when life happens.  Sometimes the employees took advantage if you were a person that handled your position.  they would slack a little and expect you to do it for them.  This caused a little stress for everyone in the picture.  Management did their best to maintain the basic structure of management to bottom of the chain."
Safeway,1c2adrifnak91fbj,5.0,The focus is to stay safe at work in a safe environment. Handle PPE precautions daily. Keep your eyes open and stay alert. Attend all meetings and in uniform.
Safeway,1c2abu7ftbrcq805,4.0,I worked at the fuel station. Fast pace at times but for the most part steady. The staff was great to work around. For the most part pretty flexible with my  schedule. It was a temporary position but enjoyed working there.
Safeway,1c29hvkil5ncqe72,2.0,"Constant work and very little time to breathe, while a fun job to have at times, management always wanted more done then was possible with the staff that they had. Other Staff constantly stressed and not very nice. However the customer service was always the top priority, and positivity was always present when dealing with customers. my favorite part of the job was being able to help people get what they want."
Safeway,1c28ks9f4aqguau4,4.0,"Don't get me wrong, Safeway gave me a great first job that lasted a little over 2 years. It was great but over my time there, people complained more than anything else. Employees complained, customers complained."

Safeway,1c27pvcqob84vcnk,1.0,"Poor management, low pay, takes forever to become a journeyman, low benefits, and a lot more. I swear working there is like being in a cut-throat high school where bullies, drama, and popularity are the norm."
Safeway,1c26ou21sakcrfie,4.0,"this was a great job for me, especially when i was just a courtesy clerk, and all that was expected of me was to greet and help customers.  I was then promoted to GMHBC, and also got trained on pricing, audits, resets,  etc. However with that advancement there also came much more responsibility and at times it can be overwhelming, as the crew could sometimes see insubordinate, with a cut-throat like atmosphere.  Also their starting wage was only $7.25  per hr while the national wage was $8.25/hr.  But because they offered health insurance (expensive), they were allowed to get away with paying that wage.  There were plenty of opportunities to learn new skills, and to interact with the public."
Safeway,1c25r4d78brcod0i,1.0,Very toxic atmosphere. People always bickered among one another rather than working as a team. Constant customer complaints about being ignored or hearing foul language. Management was awful and didn't care about their subordinates. Very sexist towards women.
Safeway,1c259iqdqb88tfpb,4.0,"Working graveyards as a grocery/food clerk can be great if you are on the food clerk scale. I always got around 40hrs a week and it adds up quick toward the next tier for payment within the union (every 1040hrs you go up a tier, that's twice a year at 40hrs per week)."
Safeway,1c23mh07eb88tdna,2.0,Working at Safeway it's been very challenging I wouldn't recommend it for anybody unless you are a great people person. Don't mind people yelling at you with a customers or management. Hey also isn't that great I mean if your courtesy clerk you get $11 an hour starting next year before that when I started it was $9.30 now its almost $11 there is absolutely no future in the grocery peeps!! I wouldn't recommend working at Safeway at all and that's you just saving money for college. There's no advancement stay for you either.
Safeway,1c206frugak4uc8l,4.0,This company served as a starter job for me through high school and college and now I am looking for a new opportunity. A typical day at work is to start off the day see what needs to be completed by a chart on the clip board. What I learned from Safeway was to be stronger than I ever thought I had to be learning new experiences not only alone with the job duties but also with handling customers needs and wants. Management was overall well and fair. Workplace culture not that great a lot of hostility in the workplace people not agreeing with how a job should be done. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the co-workers customers were better. The most enjoyable part of the job helping out customer's and providing them with excellent customer service.
Safeway,1c1ujr7gub80r8ue,2.0,I just dont think The stores should be open On christmas day!!!! Its wrong!!  we never Really get to enjoy the holidays!! its Just the money Greed & they dont Care about there Employees At all!!

Safeway,1c1t0quq8b84u8jk,3.0,"Safeway was a great company to work for. The employees were like family mostly. Management was hit or miss most of the time. Corporate level management is where a lot of the problem is. They expect a lot of you, especially and can be overly rude and over critical. With the help that you're provided, you do the best you can. You never get praise for the work you do, only berated(verbally) for the things wrong, and yet they never lift a finger to help. They also throw twice the work on the ""old timers"" because the ""millennials"" don't want to work or think they shouldn't work that hard. A lot of the problems started to get worse after a couple years after Albertsons started running the company."

You do not get vacation days or paid sick days, ect unless youve worked for over a year, they do provide insurance, but it isnt the best, you still pay a ton out of pocket."

Safeway,1c1nv28a3b88mb9s,2.0,"I worked at both a Starbucks kiosk and general cashier.   Was promised full time in the interview and never received the hours I asked for,  even combining the two positions. Other newer hires were promoted over those who had worked there for longer periods. Very low morale of staff due to poor management. Store director never complimented good work,  only pointed out minor flaws, and showed favoritism to certain employees.  Very high turnover.  Enjoyed the job itself and other coworkers,  but highly disappointed otherwise.  No way a single person can support themselves working here unless you stay there for years and work into management. Not sure if this is true for Safeway in general,  or just this location, but I would not recommend this job."

Safeway,1c1mdpe2u1d0e3a7,3.0,"Working at Starbucks in Safeway allowed me to connect with customers at more of a personal level. It's a great 1st job to gain experience. But I had very poor management where I wasn't able to work on my school stuff. Instead I've been working full time everyday as an opener. It's a really fun job for younger people to enjoy. Being a barista isn't an easy job, it takes time to learn how to make every single drink at Starbucks and plus everyone is different.There's just a lot you have to cope with as a barista, such as memorizing regulars drinks (in which it took me a month to remember) but overall working at Starbucks at Safeway isn't a terrible job it's just a great start off of what customer service is really like and demonstrates how to deal with people everyday."

The other employees are friendly, and the management team provides some fun experiences for the staff. They really try to accommodate time off requests. You're more likely to get as many hours as you want the more availability that you have. If you have restrictions, anyone who has been at the company longer than you has priority as to the shifts that they want to work. The longer you stay at the company, the more consistent your hours will be."

I was told that after 6 months I could request a pay increase, but after 6 months was told that was not allowed. Basically told two different things by two different managers!"

Every hour I would walk up and down each aisle of the store pushing a broom making sure their were no spills and help any customers who needed assistance. Afterwards, I would go through and clean the restrooms each hour then go outside to retrieve shopping carts. I would then if it were slow go put back items to the shelves that customers didn't want; put back broken items to the back of the store for processing."
Safeway,1c1j47ev11fdv6r6,3.0,"Safeway is a good company to work for temporarily, as long as you show up everyday and do what is expected there is minimal trouble. The employees gossip with each other about the other employees often in a negative manner. The deli department needs a massive improvement, there are horrible communication issues and the department in general is very disorganized. Management is bad, in less then a year of working there the man manager changes 5 times which made it very difficult to adapt to each different mangers' style of overseeing the store."

Safeway,1c1e9i124ak4lehb,3.0,"I was hired as a temporary position, this particular Safeway hires only part time because of the location and business in that area.  I enjoyed working there but needed full time."
Safeway,1c1e91qon1fdv48u,4.0,"Working at safeway can be fun at times when they have random events and parties for employees.  Management have interesting views on things outside the work place which keeps it more laid back when conversations come up. Not alot of guessing when it comes to work, most the time you can come in and get right to work."
Safeway,1c1dket4j1d0e3o9,5.0,"Wasn’t a bad place just needed more money, they give raises you just have to show that you are willing to work and learn as you go the faster you learn the faster you move up"
Safeway,1c1cj1nc60mct0ic,3.0,"It was very laid back. i got to be my own supervisor. Unfortunately, we were required to take a 15 minute break every hour with unpaid lunches. it was a good job though"
Safeway,1c1c8tm3pb88h8j5,2.0,"Of all times to have this job I am thankful for my first employment opportunity was a courtesy clerk at the age of 16. However, after a couple years and becoming wise to the lack of change and opoportunity, one should move on not plan on making a career out of it if you want to be happy in life. The only benefit is the job security from being in a union."
Safeway,1c1c2hj931fdr2qr,1.0,"Hate this place point blank. no paid time off horrible pay horrible management. No overtime. treated poorly associates are not hard workers,never full 40hours"

Safeway,1c1b4gi6pb84lab1,3.0,I worked here while going to school. Not trying to advance. Management was flexible with my hours so that I could work and go to school. Not a bad team to work for at my store at least.
Safeway,1c19u2j7fb84id3o,2.0,"Just don't work for them. Also, you have to pay the union $50 per month. You only get 10 cents more than minimum wage for being part of the union. They expect too much and care too little about your needs."
Safeway,1c19chac91fdn17n,3.0,I worked at Safeway as a courtesy clerk and did not enjoy it.  It was an easy job that anybody could do and is not that difficult.  It was simple but I personally did not enjoy it.
Safeway,1c19849trb84ib4u,1.0,"Jobs okay for the first 6 months, maybe. Then it's a fast plummet to stress, anxiety, unachievable work expectations, low and unnecessarily inconsistent hours, and dealing with immature self-entitled management that has no clue how to do their job or properly treat their employees."
Safeway,1c1958liab84id9o,3.0,I managed a work force of 5 and served as a Barista. I learned how to make coffee drinks and be a successful manager. Management was ok there. Very friendly environment. The hardest part of job was not being able to get rid of bad employees. Most enjoyable part was working with the customers.
Safeway,1c18uot241d0a2o4,2.0,"I went in the day before I started working to do a training online (watching videos, etc) but the computer was acting up and after they worked on it for 45 minutes they sent me home and said they'd have my do it my first week. I asked about it during my first 2 weeks and they never got back to me. My training ended up being ""on the job"" by a hostile supervisor. I worked hard and came in any time they needed extra help & I received compliments from customers, but nothing was appreciated by my supervisor and when I got injured from the greasy floors in the deli area after working there almost 4 months they let me go. They told me my probationary period is one year and ""it's not working out"". Luckily I still had health insurance through my parents so I was able to get everything fixed and I'm ready to work again."
Safeway,1c18k6mtn1d1e6ri,3.0,n/a It is better to say nothing at all than to speak ill of an employer. Instead i will have to fill this space with unnecessary typing in order to meet the minimum charater limit.
Safeway,1c18e33of0mtp17h,4.0,was a good place to start my job experience to help me know what was next in the job field. Would probably still be there if they did not shut stores and distribution centers in Virginia.

Safeway,1c169rfmq0mcl1mu,4.0,"A typical day at work is either slow or busy business. I learned customer service, communication skills, computer knowledge and marketing sales. My management was equal and fair towards their fellow employees. The work culture is friendly, safe and clean. The hardest part of the job is running around like a chickens head cut off supervising/maintaining the store and dealing with unsatisfied customers that complained about a situation. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the sun is out and people have a positive attitude plus game days and cheerful holiday spirits too."
Safeway,1c15rv0ef1bg860h,5.0,A fun place to work at. Other associates are friendly and fun to get along with. Customers are understanding of busy times. Stressful moments at times but as a team it's easy to get through the day

The downer is you can get relocated to another store without giving you much notice, next day your somewhere else. And that's why I left was transfered 4 times"
Safeway,1c14koais1ah87jr,2.0,"Micromanagement is just a part of another day at work. If you  find good co-workers and can get along with them you'll be fine, but most are just crazy, require a boatload of patience to deal with, and aren't professional."
Safeway,1c14e5p180kbl49v,3.0,"Great job security and support from management, good work environment, management positions are demanding and require excellent time management skills for effective work/life balance"
Safeway,1c142a5oi1d066bl,2.0,"The only decent manager was the immediate manager at the fuel station.  The store managers and supervisors are all manipulative and will say what you like to hear in order to get results with no intention of keeping their end of any bargain.  In the year I worked there after the made a change to union, they had union representatives ""lie"" in order to make the changes they saw necessary, and did not offer promised compensation and even lied about making such promises."
Safeway,1c13mtb591d154em,3.0,was a fun fast paced and productive place to work only sometimes the management wouldnt be on the same page. also working at a union job there was alot of differences that needed to be clear
Safeway,1c13kl85a1d051si,4.0,I worked here for almost two years the people were fun to work with for the most part but it was also pretty stressful sometimes. But overall if you like being busy all the time id recommend Safeway.

Safeway,1c0sq047ab89be1h,3.0,"Even though I was part-time and a courtesy clerk, I had been treated poorly by management. Money was stolen from my jacket in my locker and when I made an incident report, my manager didn't believe me and shrugged it off. I was usually pushed around by cashiers. I either would get one 15 minute break that is always late no matter how many hours I work that day or I wouldn't get a break at all because everyone's breaks somehow get ""delayed and late"" but you see the other managers sitting outside smoking a cigarette every 30 minutes. The only good thing I liked about this job is I managed to become friends with the nicer cashier's and courtesy clerks because they can relate on how I feel, the job pays, most customers are very nice, and my hard work gets recognized by the customers."
Safeway,1c0sek7unb86085h,3.0,"As a driver, Being on the roads for hours could be stressful; traffic and others causes can make this job really hard to perform. Management does not take in count those situations. Stressful job."

I've been with the company for 5 years and I'm sad to go but I have to provide for my family."
Safeway,1c0lh670fak9u93d,1.0,"Safeway has changed drastically since being purchased by the Investment group that also purchased/saved Albertsons. Since the change in ownership, in my region, nearly all corporate management has been pushed out and replaced with Albertsons personnel who don't care about the well being of the employees. They only care about making more money, at the expense of employees and even customers who get wrong prescriptions, from pharmacists who shouldn't be allowed to have a license. There is no accountability for individuals who don't have a good work ethic, and so anyone who is a hard worker, typically ends up doing the vast majority of the work load."
Safeway,1c0lgo83ib81na89,1.0,You can easily fall behind in the job if you’re not always on your toes. Costumers are  always pleasant and make the long shift easier. Union reps usually there for you in crisis situations.

Safeway,1c0i85c5nas1ra7g,4.0,"I have learned many things. Patients are amazing. I absolutely loved my job due to patients and the volunteers that I have spent my days with. Helping people and just loving on them and comforting them became my passion. A typical day is often fast paced, no day is ever the same. Sometimes there are curve balls thrown at you and you have  to try your hardest to get those straightened out for the benefit of the patient as well as the hospital departments. Recent change in Management, has somewhat made things difficult and made the workplace a somewhat difficult place to be. I still go to work everyday with a positive attitude and be the best for those amazing patients and do my job to the best of my ability. I feel like the new management does not listen or value your thoughts. I feel like they also do not have compassion for family values."
Safeway,1c0i7cbgdb81geaq,4.0,I learned how to be a better multi-tasker and improved my customer skills but working holidays at a grocery store Starbucks isn't worth it. Making coffee was an enjoyable skill to lean but i feel stuck and wat to advance.

When I first started in 2000 they were a good company but have since cut back on benefits and pay, trying to compete with Walmart and Target. New hires will never make as much as I did or have as good of benefits. Management doesn’t care about the employees. They are all about top dollar. The culture of the company is awful. It’s all about each person for themselves. Employees  there are bitter and rude to customers and each other. It’s a hostile and terrible environment to be in. Please don’t work here for the love of everything, save yourself and those you love."

Safeway,1c09ja94tb85heq9,5.0,Safeway is great place to work as long as you have a good manager. You do a lot because when it is slow they all ask you to do other tasks to help out.  All days are good until you have a bad customer or a problem with a co  worker.  otherwise a great place.

Safeway,1c02mlpumaqh7940,2.0,"The job is not hard at all. Most locations give you the opportunity to advance and cross train if you like. At my store, management was the problem. The store director micromanaged and constantly wanted you to go above and beyond your duties (completing tasks in other departments) but did not want to compensate you for it. I was utilized in four different areas in the store (cashier, customer service clerk, manager, inventory control clerk) to be a team player and help out the store. I was taken advantage of, the company only cares about the bottom line. They do not care about you or any family/life issues that you have going on."
Safeway,1c028ikh8brcv81v,4.0,"Overall, it's a great first job for teens and beneficial to employees who have been there for awhile. This work place is great for teens still in high school due to scheduling and gaining work experience."

Safeway,1c01negplbrcv8ph,4.0,My one complaint about Safeway was regarding hours. Every cashier had to work some of the undesirable shifts regardless of any extenuating circumstances.  That requirement made working at Safeway difficult for me with a baby with health issues.
Safeway,1c00edlpfb858df9,4.0,"I love shopping at Safeway because their prices are affordable for my family. Unfortunately, my store had a lack of hours at the end of the summer so I had to leave the company."
Safeway,1c002ks7cb858afn,4.0,"Very fast-paced and if you're not ready for the job or think you can't do it, you probably got hired for the wrong position. You can either do this job in the deli or you cannot. Lots of heavy lifting and pressure constantly. Double shifts are sometimes a requirement. This job is like a marriage but I would recommend it to anyone."
Safeway,1bvvoak3l1d1e752,2.0,"I didn't really like safeway but it also was a really long time ago, just didn't get paid enough and did't like the culture of it in all honesty but oh well."
Safeway,1bvvabvvs1d1e3rs,1.0,"They do not meet any needs except their own. Job and life balance is none, it's either what Safeway or as the employees call it Slaveway wants or they cut your hours so you can barely survive so you have to grovel for hours. I have never been in a less friendly staffed environment in my life."
Safeway,1bvva76jfb80pdjo,4.0,"Safeway is requires more and more reports and corporate statistics that ""must be"" submitted but they do not give the staff adequate labor coverage to accomplish this. They base labor on script count so if extra time is needed to serve a patient, scripts aren't being generated so ,in essence, the pharmacy loses."
Safeway,1bvv7ceabakd6a3m,1.0,"There is never enough time to accomplish their expectations so you are constantly stressed, compelling you to not take a break simply because someone's going to get on your case about what you haven't done."

Safeway,1bvtu7pqsbrcpcq3,2.0,"A typical day at work would start with welcomes and hello's when I clock in to work. I would then get asked if I could work on what needs to be done the most such as carts, stocking, and facing. Management when you are a new hire can be different because they will treat them more aggressive in a way, but not too harsh. They will take advantage of you if you are a yes-man."
Safeway,1bvt52rd15ncuadf,3.0,This was my first ever job.. not the best job by far.. not many hours.. really slow most of the time.. co workers barely work. I really didn’t like working at Safeway.. was happy to finally leave.

Safeway,1bvqnnlboaqh18if,4.0,it's a good job but i wasn't getting more hours and no benefits because i wasn't full time and i wasn't with the company for a while and my schedule was too random hours
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bvqhsj7lakd6e91,3.0,"I would not recommend this job long term. If you're looking for a part time summer job then Safeway is a good start up place. Typically understaffed, moral of company decreased once Albertsons bought Safeway."
Safeway,1bvqa9psaakh0c6m,2.0,Being that this place was my first employer I did learn a lot but expected more from a company that is very large. if they would pay their employees more maybe grocery store employees might be happier.
Safeway,1bvq3jsia1d1e6nh,4.0,I enjoyed my work career at Safeway. One really great thing about working with this company is that they will cross train you in all departments. They want to see you do good and grow. The union scale does make it hard and seem long to get pay raises.
Safeway,1bvoqg8vtbrcpapk,4.0,"The Safeway I work at is a Productive work enviroment with unadequate wages to prices today in my local area, my wage is 11.10 /hr working about 20ish hours a week"
Safeway,1bvogumujb80pc83,3.0,"Working at Safeway is pretty okay. I worked there for about a year and I was promoted twice. I did not, however, receive a raise more than five cents. The hours are awful, you hardly ever get time off, but the management are decent. You don't get to pick your schedule, and they either give you hardly any hours or way too much."
Safeway,1bvnm3ighak54dop,5.0,While I was working overnights for Safeway it was a very stress free environment and very quick pace. The people and the manager that worked over nights were very nice and helpful.

Safeway,1bvj51mn1akh0eqr,3.0,Fast paced and must know your prices and what to do in a tight pinch. Must know about rain-checks and how to call on managers when needed. Always have a friendly face.
Safeway,1bvj2kraub852dtb,4.0,"I liked the work that I did cause if you did your job right then you basically can deliver at your own pace and you didn't have to worry about rushing to get it done.

Safeway,1bviemjlcakd0bpt,4.0,Typical day is a hard day because it is a busy place. I learned how to communicate with customers in better way. The mangement were very nice people.  The hardest part of the job is everything because your always busy.
Safeway,1bvguv4e6b80pa36,3.0,"Loved most of my coworkers, but could not get any assistance with customers or with replacing tills. Customer volume was extreme and rude. My other coworkers, whenever I asked them to assist me or do something for a customer, were completely deaf to my voice. At least my managers were more helpful."
Safeway,1bvg8ao1rb852eh0,2.0,"Management was inconsistent with communication and they would show poor manners around the customers.  It was a mess! ! was hired saying that I was guaranteed a minimum of 28 hours weekly but the only way to make the hours count was to work 6-7 days a week.  so they would call me on my days off often and then have attitudes if I couldn't fill in. so I was working 6-7 days sometimes in the five months that I worked there. I've visited other Safeway's and the least on my list it 56th street one in Tacoma,WA.  I was highly disappointed!  But I loved being a F/E Cashier!"
Safeway,1bvg0ls0tbrcpek2,3.0,No one should be so stressed at a job. Long hours and a short amount of time to get certain tasks done.  Just can't handle all of the stress all the time.
Safeway,1bveu3s6ebrcpasr,4.0,I’ve been working in safeway for almost 3yrs. I started as a starbucks clerk and got cross trained into different departments. Never had a rough time until we got the present manager.
Safeway,1bvemg8k0b852dik,5.0,I absolutely loved having my intership here for pharmacy. The pharmacist was amazing hilarious and very different. The technicians were very helpful and understanding
Safeway,1bvecagaj52sk97a,5.0,"Worked at the register for one week and was promoted to customer service then promoted to the teller position, however the wage did not increase. Customers always wanted something for free. Poor management on the western union machine, always told customers that it was down, when indeed it was just a pain in the you know what to work on."
Safeway,1bve7vu6i5nckabd,2.0,This compnay is a very childish set up. They argue with management over the dumbest of things. They never hear one another out to resolve a situation.
Safeway,1bvdpdcn91d0b3sk,3.0,"Many of the employees worked together, but a supervisor can make the whole store a hard place to work. Safeway does not pay very well, it would be better if they paid"

Safeway,1bvcsl4qn52sk8ol,1.0,workers are not really appreciated. I worked there for 2 months and I never felt appreciated by management. you are forced to join a union and I always feel that should be optional.
Safeway,1bvc3pnftb88g8gl,1.0,DONT DO IT! Find Something Better! Not worth anyone hard work or time. company has gone down hill since it was bought out. they no longer care for the employee. its all about the $$$
Safeway,1bv8l5mhc1fdv2pk,4.0,"I enjoyed my time at Safeway. Please note, this was a contract position through KForce, Inc."
Safeway,1bv8c8n2r1d0b0us,4.0,"A typical work day goes by either fast, or very slow... My coworkers were very helpful with me when I first started working. The Deli manager was kinda rude at times. But I put the attitude in the back and moved on from it while doing what she told me to do... The workplace was very fun, fast, and a lot of learning was being done. I had to learn how to maintain the hotcase, clean the fryers, and do a whole 5 hour shift by myself... The hardest part about the job would have to be when youre there by yourself and have to keep up on the costumers, food, and everything else all at once it feels like. The most enjoyable part is watching the costumers walk away with a smile on their face because they got what they wanted and was being treated well. I enjoyed working with my coworkers as well,  they made great friends."
Safeway,1bv7gest6b84ockn,3.0,Honestly don’t like this job very much as they say they are understanding but always seem to get upset at you for doing exactly what they say. Wish for a better job than here.
Safeway,1bv71d2e8b84od11,4.0,"Working at Safeway required diligence and the ability to work efficiently even if others did not. They do focus alot upon customer service and ""the customer is always right"". I liked most managers but some I knew could have used more discretion in their dealing with employees. However, it is an entry level job and I still benefit from lessons I learned there."
Safeway,1bv6o2qiab88ge1e,3.0,This company was excellent to work for when I had small children and worked part time. There was flexibility in changing schedules as long as you were still accomplishing the your job in  the required time frame. The system changes in time requirements for distress and orders did not compute the direct customer service that may have been involved at any given time. In later years it was a challenge to achieve the job goals that were required. For many years prior to this I felt my job was an excellent example of part-time employment.
Safeway,1bv62gpvj1fdv3b2,2.0,"Management issues, looked down upon for having a family.  I learned I would not like to advance do to management.  Most of the other employees are nice and we all get along but everyone feels the same.  I used to want to move up to show other reviews not all management is bad but that has changed. Good luck to anyone who decides to work here."
Safeway,1bv62dcdhb84ocff,3.0,"I think management needs to have more reasonable goals based off the people that they hire.  You cannot have one seasoned person in the deli, if deli employees call in sick, expect to train the baggers they decide to move over to help you during the dinner rush expect to be able to get orders out, carry out cash/credit card transactions, and expect the chicken in the oven to be calibrated and not put to the side because there are too many things going on.  Management needs to know in a situation like that if they are not going to jump in something will get put off for later to do just to carry out customers’ orders."
Safeway,1bv5sad63b84od6l,4.0,At safeway it was easy i had a great time working with customers and the people working there are great to work with and they are great to the customers.

Safeway,1bv5fsblg1fdv089,5.0,"I appreciated working for Safeway they have always taken care of me my mother who was a single mother got a job there at fifteen and works there still. It provides a family environment as everyone gets close at Safeway. Safeway made Serving employees enjoyable as it provided first class customer service in return it seems customers respected us for that. I learned to always look for something that needs to be done because if you have nothing to do you didn't do your job right, as there is always something to do.The hardest part of the job was bagging groceries, not that it was hard at all but customers preference can be different each time. I really enjoyed working for a manager who treated us like family. The most enjoyable was getting to know customers and customers getting to know you."
Safeway,1bv3oe9k4akco805,5.0,The people are very friendly and the work place is always full of energy making your days worth every second! Everyone is very helpful and ready to assist with anything.
Safeway,1bv379mlg5n8merk,5.0,Fun place to work. Plenty of overtime available due to high turnover. Union rules create unfair pay scales; checkout associates make 35% more than department managers
Safeway,1bv33clnmak8qa47,2.0,"Aside from being in a cooler for 8 hours and waking up at 4am to cut fruits and get your sleeves wet, it was a pretty easy job up until the labor union tried to strong arm me into joining them and ultimately left me working one day a week. I was payed weekly so there werent many complaints from me. I didnt have to deal with customers and no one really bothered me unless i was out on the sales floor."
Safeway,1bv32j50kakgoa9q,3.0,Working for Safeway is a full time job. Many demands from management that are sometimes unrealistic. Co workers do what they have to do on a daily basis. High energy needed for this position
Safeway,1bv2uqmt41d0b6dc,5.0,"I had a lot of fun working here, would love to work here again!  While here the pace of work was pretty fast at time and slow at others depending on customers.  The employees are very nice and was very easy to make friends with everyone."

Safeway,1bv0iqdgr1d07011,3.0,All duties were geared to weekly payroll therefore weeks were all repetitive so became boring fast.  The job was very fast paced and deadlines had to be met.  Environment was too open and very distracting.  Quite a lot of upheaval over Albertsons buying Safeway.

Safeway,1buv6sb4h1d0r62i,2.0,"Being a Courtesy Clerk at Safeway was my first job. I worked my butt off and always did other peoples work. Most of the people that work there are extremely lazy. I was an outstanding courtesy clerk, I always helped others even when I was in the middle of sweeping or mopping the floor. I don't think that my co workers took the job as serious as I did. I would always go above and beyond during every shift."
Safeway,1buv26l5n1d0r0iu,1.0,"Not a good place to work at all. if your thinking about working here, run fast! Good luck making a decent living, they will cut you back to nothing and not feel one bit bad."

Safeway,1buubv2mb1d185dn,3.0,"Very simple, just have to follow what the manager demands you to do. I was a courtesy clerk which was the only department 16 and 17 year olds can work in, so I got to deal with carts, bagging groceries, and cleaning."
Safeway,1buu467hv1d0r3d6,1.0,"The more seasoned employees trash talking other Supervisors. Lots of whispering. It is paid training, but they do not teach you much of what you will actually need to know to be on the floor. Not once did I feel valued."

Safeway,1butkgqbf0kbt1p8,1.0,"typical day at work included fighting over what piece of equipment you would get for the work day with other employees, hardest part of the job is being able to adapt to the speed/pace at which they expect of you. the only beneficial part of the job is being paid on a weekly basis, as well as the benefits. work environment is a bit abrasive, and it is extremely fast paced. supervisors and managers do not no the definition of the word ""empathy"" as they refuse to understand when/why a job was not completed within company standards. most if not all supervisors are dismissive, and rude, and if you make a mistake, no matter what you say; it's YOUR fault. very lacking in employment diversity, and a rowdy environment where you have to have high seniority to be able to challenge any of the decisions made by management or staff. furthermore there is no understanding for needing to take time off if a family member is sick. has to be immediate family (brother/sister/grandparent/parent) to count as being excused...unacceptable."
Safeway,1buslmk8g1d0r65j,3.0,"It is a typical retail experience in the pharmacy, a long task list and not enough people or hours to do it. If you have good management it is not as stressful, but when you have lack of management and coworkers that have way too many personal issues that effect their workflow makes the job stressful and not enjoyable."

My work required fast-pacing, critical thinking, etc."
Safeway,1burq0j581d0i6af,3.0,"A typical day at Safeway would be, getting to work clocking in and going back to the bakery, first thing wash your hands sing the birthday song to make sure you had washed and dried your hands long enough, Safety first. Then help customers as they arrived at the bakery. check the floor to make sure there was enough product out for incoming customers to purchase at their will. Clean the cases, Package and / or bag product as needed to be put out onto the floor. Make sure to meet and greet every customer as they came through the bakery.Ask them if they needed help. If they did and it was in another part of the store you let someone in the bakery know that you would be back that you were helping a customer find a product in another part of the store, return to your station after the customer had been satisfied with their purchase.

They have corporate visits all the time so be prepared to work overnight 10 plus hours with no appreciation. I don't recommend working for this company at all, take your chances at mcdonalds. The only good part was there is room to grow but they don't appreciate anything."
Safeway,1bupjtcje1d0i12h,3.0,"I’ve been working at the call center in Deer Valley for about a year. My coworkers are all nice and most of the supervisors are also. The marketing and IT departments are horrible. They run promotions and the day they launch, they don’t work. They barely provide the CSRs with info on the promotions which makes it hard to help customers. Go into work on Monday and there’s 80 calls holding because some promotion that we know little about was launched. They make it seem like they are very concerned with the customers concerns but they really aren’t. As a call center they aren’t too strict on your performance. I mean they will tell you when you do well or when you don’t do well, but they don’t make you feel bad for needing improvement. Most supervisors are willing to help you. Overall it is a decent job but can be very frustrating.  It also can be very busy depending on if they are understaffed or which promotion isn’t working that week. Shifts are assigned at random in training but there are frequent opportunities to change them based on your performance."

Safeway,1buioed2d0mcl5lb,3.0,The work was fast paced and very busy. The breaks were only 15 minutes. It was a very long commute from home so I had to resign. I had the opportunity to stock shelves when it was less busy.

Safeway,1buhmbkiq1d1141p,1.0,I use to work here during my high school years and while I was working there I felt like there was a lot of disorganized people there I was in line for a promotion but ended up getting knocked out of it by a lie by an employee
Safeway,1buhl4mna0mt36sq,3.0,I worked in the Deli at Safeway. I learned a lot about deli products and about giving great customer service. I didn't like that I was there for 2 years and I could not advance to a higher paying job
Safeway,1buhjjlka1d1122u,2.0,the people i worked among where very prejudice and disrespectful of other employees and customers. Many people there would follow people around the store simply based of their looks alone. Management was either disrespectful or careless.
Safeway,1bugul29r1d0269q,4.0,I did. I worked in just about every department and helped almost everyone in the store. There was nothing I couldn't do and I still felt unfairly paid and noticed. Safeway under utilizes it's best employees and leaves them by the wayside.
Safeway,1bufu4js61bg953i,4.0,My job was just not something I was suited for. It was gross and back breaking. The manager of the deli was ok Mostly but the store manager was not a nice guy.

Safeway,1bufabe4jak55fpo,1.0,Managers are awful and have no respect for who works there. they dont treat anyone fairly and cause all of the hard working and caring people to quit.
Safeway,1buf1afif1ai2395,3.0,"Safeway is a challenging place to work. Never a dull moment. .It is great to get to work with the customers, and the employees are happy and work together as a team."
Safeway,1buelcr39b84oavl,1.0,"Poor communication within the managers. Pay raises go based on the amount of hours you work, i.e. you have to work 600 hours before your first pay raise."
Safeway,1buej8v8d1fdn5uj,1.0,"I did not have a good time working for this company. Pay was terrible and wasn't worth it in the end. Management is sub-par at the most. Don't expect to get promoted, even if you work your absolute hardest."
Safeway,1buej29ct1fdn3o9,2.0,"Provide customer service fulfilling customer orders, cashiering, and cooking serving food. Answer customer questions, placing orders, and preparing orders. I learned how the grocery industry works. My dept. manager was nice. Often understaffed and overworked. Being understaffed. Most enjoyable was working with the public. I enjoy working the public."
Safeway,1buehtnd8as15e18,3.0,Company has changed tremendously since being acquired and merging with Albertsons. Work life balance is non existent. Everyone works by fear of loosing their job. This trickles down from the corporate office which places the district managers under a lot of stress which is then placed on the store manger. A lot of corporate employees have and still continue to be laid off. It makes one feel insecure about the future of th company. All and all I stay because I love working with and for people. I just want more security and transparency in the company I work for.
Safeway,1buedtc4r1fdn6r9,2.0,A typical day at work was fast paced and customer service driven. The management was sporadic due to constant General manager reassignments. The most enjoyable part of my job was building friendships with my customers.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.

Safeway,1bucmll2paqh48gg,3.0,"I enjoy working, but did not enjoy working at safeway. You can work as hard as you want but the advancement is all based on seniority, even if you work harder than a person who was hired 2 days before you they would get the better position before you would be given the chance."
Safeway,1bucjhqflb80safr,1.0,"The management for this job is extremely terrible, there is no general communication, lack of help and overall they show no appreciation. The hours are terrible and they do not care to add any to your pay"

Safeway,1buc0d8reb84o982,4.0,Can get away with doing nothing as long as u look like your working . If you are a backup checker expect to be in a checked and your whole shift. Expect to get nothing done with poor manager who don't like to check
Safeway,1bubcdglu1d1e231,5.0,"My 2 years at Safeway has been fun. I've met a lot of great people and customers! Sometimes it is stressful. Safeway is a money hungry company so sometimes they try to cut your hours, or gove your department less hours to work with so that part becomes a little hard."

Safeway,1bu95fh8cak508b2,1.0,The manager that I had was very stressful. Very mean and not very understanding that I was a employee in training. They just left me by myself while I had a line of customers and didn't know what I was doing.
Safeway,1bu940tuh52vfen1,3.0,Job was as a courtesy clerk and it was minimalistic. Wasnt any room for growth and favoritism was played at the store I worked. Nto everyone got treated equally and people were akward.

Safeway,1bu75jrug1fdh1kq,1.0,"I just had a hard time with co workers release programs, everyone already worked there for 12 years in their positions and customers calling all checker stupid for their previous history. I was new and I was called stupid by the customers. I held in there and tried to provide customer service in that environment everyday. I had to leave. Too petty to me."
Safeway,1bu6opv2vaqh0efe,4.0,"I believe in this company ,and had a chance to gain a career opportunity in a world franchise that has provided serves to million of people. With the professional attitude of greeting a diverse ethic of people. Being productive in a routine schedule of job duties that provided compliance with standard rules and regulation."
Safeway,1bu66ngvt5j76f4q,2.0,On a typical day I would be scheduled there for 5-6 hours however I was frequently held over to the maximum amount of hours that I was legally allowed to be there. I learned a lot about stocking different produce and how to package items in the cut fruit room. I had to be able to perform different tasks that weren't in my department. I also learned that you cannot judge a company by its name. The work life and treatment of the employees varies from store to store.
Safeway,1bu4vl3201fdh0vq,5.0,"My typical day at work was to go in the back warehouse and start loading the pallets out the truck and then start stocking the grocery/merchandise out in the store. I learned a lot about tags,bar codes, and ordering items for customers. The management was great until we got new managers that made the store go downhill by cutting everyone hours and then making a bunch of people quit. The workplace at Safeway was really calming. Hardest part of the job was trying to find where each item belonged, for example trying to find a item that goes in a specific aisle. The most enjoyable part of the job was accomplishing everything that needed to be done, all the stress goes away which is a great feeling!"
Safeway,1bu4efrd01fdh7br,1.0,The managers were poorly trained & there was a couple scandals going on.It was low staffed so your best wasn't enough.Managers talked about employees.
Safeway,1bu4d2isq1fdh0f4,4.0,I enjoyed this job. Customers were for the most part relaxed and happy. I worked with great people. It was a fun and happy environment. To bad when i had to relocate i could not get transferred to another store due to no spot available.
Safeway,1bu4bn4r01fdh4aa,3.0,Safeway concentrated on customer service so it taught you how to talk to people and patients on how to deal with difficult people management was understanding for the most part. it also had very mixed ages of employees
Safeway,1bu2rinib1fdh12h,1.0,i loved the alamo safeway even though everone is all over the place but people their was nice butt lake mertt people their has one heck of a scew lose. to many robberys and some people their get trigggered for no reason its just dumb.
Safeway,1bu1mfvml5nbfa5m,4.0,"The most important take-away from this job was the knowledge i gained from on-the-job experience. What each prescription does, and how prescription insurance actually works, is knowledge I am thankful to have."
Safeway,1bu19m7921d0r0bc,1.0,a very stressful environment to attempt to grow and develop a team. district management teams are more than willing to replace anyone at any time for any reason. job security is two star.

Safeway,1bu16r278aqgue1r,1.0,"This is a horrible company and culture to work for, they have no regards for the workers below the offices nor the people in the offices. Their is no question why this company is destined to fail in the time coming"
Safeway,1bu086isf1d175kb,4.0,This is a very stressful environment. I don’t recommend it to anyone who is looking for a career within this company due to management and sanitation issues.
Safeway,1bu01i0i7brft90h,3.0,Safeway is part of Albertsons LLC.  The company direction and leadership is considerably different in tact and communication. Difficult to determine priorities and focus as they change rapidly. Training programs were dissolved an almost no attempt to rebuild or reinstate.
Safeway,1btvvakb81d0r525,5.0,In my 6 years  at Safeway I have had exceptional job opertunitys by applying myself I advanced to there in charge in the store. So as a corporation I think Safeway is a grate place to work
Safeway,1btvngqtjbrftffs,3.0,"I liked this job a lot, I loved my co-workers. Although, some weren't very nice. I enjoyed my time there when I worked there, it just wasn't the job for me."
Safeway,1btvdjhdtak938n0,4.0,"There are some pretty good benefits, good pay if you can move up, not a whole lot of opportunity for advancement past a certain point in some departments. Low starting wage for a large work load."
Safeway,1btv4923v1d17721,3.0,I haven't worked for Safeway in 6 years however for a first time job I loved it. It was a very friendly environment to work for. I would suggest this company to others.
Safeway,1btv0gb2gbrft9n5,5.0,"Gigharbor Safeway is great place to work .management is understanding n they listen to you n work with you if you have any problems at home or at work ,it is a multi culture place to work, the hardest part of the job is lifting heavy items. The best part of Safeway is customers the great customers that are always happy and pleasant to be around the not-so-happy pleasant people are the grumpy ones that you change by making them happy."
Safeway,1btv0etuu1d17240,5.0,Great training programs and tools to advance your career. Leadership was above and beyond that created a culture that drove for results while having fun at the workplace.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1btum4a825nfcesu,3.0,so breaks should be a little longer being as though your on your feet.
Safeway,1bttq8sd5brftbip,3.0,"You have to join an union, and frankly I feel like it's a waste of money. They are not supposed to ask you if you are part of the union, but the union will force you to pay even the months prior when they didn't represent you. A lot of learning opportunities since there's that many departments. By guild lines, if you are learning/helping out in different departments, your pay is may to fluctuate due to different pays in different departments. i.e. more in floral/deli/bakery"
Safeway,1btt4p2j01d173hm,2.0,No training!  They just had me jump right in ringing up customers.  Had no idea what I was doing.  Cases of beer get stolen every night and yet they refused to lock one set of doors like most other Safeways do.
Safeway,1btspqb5q1d0r574,2.0,"The store i worked out wasn't very organized and was willing to let go of employee's who weren't willing to handle one department by themselves. when it came to closing it would come down to three people to handle the whole store. It was a mess, it was stressful and a lot for someone trying to work part time. There was so much lack of co-workers and a lack of communication. They assistant manager at my job was always nice to ask for things but ask anything from him like a simple where is something and he would act like he wanted to fire you on the spot. I didn't' think all Safeway stores are like this but they need to help employees want to work there not drive them away."
Safeway,1btsovfj4as10dk0,1.0,very slow paced and lots of busy work. Some employees were very nice and fun to work with. But employee morale was always low and there was a lot of in fighting.
Safeway,1btsi7r2ebrftddc,1.0,"The day to day was easy. Come in and prepare packaged food with little to no supervision. But they had completely inefficient workplace systems and horrible management. The job wasn't hard but whatever you did, it wasn't enough. They refused to hire more help and poorly trained me when I was hired.  They expect you to put in more work than they are willing to pay you for. Wasn't willing to work with your schedule unless you gave them at least two weeks in advance to figure it out. But then they'd forget your revised schedule anyway."
Safeway,1btshgj7s5nbf8dp,3.0,management was okay for the most part but some of the customers we got were extremely rude and impatient. I learned that I don't really see myself being a deli worker at a Safeway.
Safeway,1bts8i67g1d10404,3.0,I will start of by clocking in and quickly going to my department of the day. I would make sure that everything in the department was neatly and faced correctly.
Safeway,1bts7u17b1d0r2rt,3.0,although they never get paid enough to rule the world lol...Safeway is an ok place to work. My life just went down another path or I would still be there today
Safeway,1btrmtbpi52vffh0,1.0,"The guidelines were simple but the co-workers were unreliable, gossiping, and never completed their assigned tasks. A lot of the times, they'd just walk off and go home. the manager took out all of her frustrstions on the crew every night and the facility is infested with roaches"
Safeway,1btqvadfebrfr9r3,1.0,"This store is located in a very small town so corp, dose not come often,  so all managers get away with so much underhanded stuff they are also union locale 555 witch is no better in there position for the workers"
Safeway,1btqub61sbrfre42,3.0,"A typical day at Safeway for a courtesy clerk consisted of bagging groceries and maintaining the front end area, while also performing routine safety sweeps of the entire store. I learned how to work at a fast pace and deal with several customers at a time, basically how to be more efficient. The hardest part of the job were the customers, but at the same time they were often the most enjoyable of the aspects because certain interactions were beautiful and even heart-warming."
Safeway,1btqinv84brfr9r1,3.0,"it not what you know but who you know, worked many years, had high reviews from manager, never called in late or sick but yet was passed over for someone friend for a higher position."
Safeway,1btokqjcdb8bs83b,2.0,Itwas a poorly run and judgment environment to be in. with no understanding from any management and unfortunately for what was thought to be a great first job was in a rude awakening to how disrespectful and inappropriate management and people can be in the working world. not somewhere I would ever want to work again .
Safeway,1btoaa070b8bs8mk,3.0,"Safeway is a great company and I always liked working for them. I'm sure other stores aren't as bad, but this one particular store had been given a  manager and treated all of the employees like they hadn't worked there ever before. I have been there for more than 2 years and we are constantly switching managers because in all honesty, none of the employees like this store and plenty have transferred or quit entirely because of all the frustration that comes with it. They're terrible at staffing enough people in departments and take from other departments, they are also awful at scheduling and treat their employee's unfairly. Some of the managers are rude and unprofessional when we try to call in and wonder why some people don't even call in or run out and quit without even putting in their two weeks. Nobody will really be there to make sure they're not disrespectful to us, but I'm sure it's not all their fault, they can only do so much. Sad to say that I was happy before in my job, but slowly became very unenthused and unmotivated to work there because my pay never moved and I had been promised a promotion and came back every week to the manager to check if I was promoted yet but they never gave it to me. Still no explanation. I was always doing work for others because they didn't do it, but when I miss something, I get in trouble. Countless times has that happened where I was unfairly disciplined for something that was probably someone else's problem that I was trying to or going to have to fix."
Safeway,1btnp52frbrfrdll,5.0,"Working at vons I feel that management is very understanding on working with your schedule. they train you on the basics of the store. And I felt like they want you to move up, I was promoted in the second month of working there"
Safeway,1btnmjo271d0b33h,2.0,"came in and bagged groceries and stocked shelves, pretty emotionless job with easy hours and easy mobility. i dont know what else to say this website is making me type longer"
Safeway,1btnhnn1db8bsdpr,4.0,A typical day at work would generally consist of helping as many people as you can with whatever they need and making sure you are performing your duties to the best of your ability.  The management at the store where I worked were strict yet kind individuals that enforced accountability but weren't overbearing and rude.  Overall it's exactly what you'd expect from a company as large as Safeway is because it encourages individuality in dealing with customers yet you must adhere to their conduct policies.
Safeway,1btn9su7v1d0n5ij,4.0,Work will be hard if you slack. Keeping a good pace will give you an advantage over others. management will find something for you to do if you are just standing around and those tasks will suck the most. Working with others will make the day go easier for you and those other.
Safeway,1btn8fnvfb8bsa2u,3.0,Position: Front end service
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1btm57ro41d0n64m,5.0,"One issue I find concerning at Safeway:  Increasingly employees are allowed to have music playing on their devices with no earphones.  It used to be that you had to use an earphone, and even earphones were disallowed on the sales floor after the store opened.   Human nature being what it is, once this policy takes hold, some employees push the limits, and their music can be heard three and four aisles over.  It definitely creates an element of confusion and distraction!  It is very unprofessional and inconsiderate of customers and co-workers alike.  A second music source in conflict with the music already playing on the intercom can disturb one's focus and concentration.  ""World Class Service"" should not be compromised in this manner."
Safeway,1btlhnaqv1d0n0pp,2.0,"I absolutely loved the staff that I worked with. However we were all overworked, underpaid, and not appreciated by management. The hours would change constantly. One day you may work 4am to 1230 (a four hour shift) and the next would be 5am until 9. They would give the bare minimum of hours."
Safeway,1btlfe4t41d0n7k4,4.0,there is way to much pressure put onto the store managers to perform and create results and profit it places unreasonable expectations on the employees to achieve objectives that are beyond the means given.
Safeway,1btl98qniakgob5d,3.0,"i feel bad for writing this, but honestly, it was frustrating working there.  first, they promise a wages but make you stay 90 days to get them.  days off are  appreciated but you work hard because either people just leave or theres not enough crew to support.  the manager isnt indiffferent, just everyones in the same boat."
Safeway,1btl6bqkqb8bs913,2.0,A lot is expected of workers while hard work is not rewarded. Even managers are paid very little and are expected to work 50+ hours a week while on salary.
Safeway,1btkut7vfb8bscrp,3.0,"Just a bad time in general, no one was nice and the manager was never there the entire 3 months I worked. I never liked the work environment, no one was friendly and gave little respect to my position."
Safeway,1btkptmb31d0n6ih,2.0,@ management tells you what they know you want to hear to shut you up you will get ours but the pay sucks the employees are all about themselves there's no teamwork management does not produce results the store is a mess
Safeway,1btkdol8l1d0b34m,3.0,"This was a fun and fast paced paced job. There were many strong personalities to work with and a fair bit of favoritism. Overall, it was not a bad experience, but I could not handle the physical requirements of the job."
Safeway,1btk41jib1d0n26m,4.0,"The particular Safeway/Vons that I work at is a fast pace, fairly large grocery store. I think management and the employees do the best job possible. I learned and gained a lot more patience than I thought I had. The service deli is a very fast paced environment,even without the management aspect of it. I have observed a lot of employees voice their anger, frustrations, and stress over the job. Although, I think it is important, working in the deli, it is not what I envision myself doing for the future so it is hard for me to get frustrated and angry about the job. Even with that said, I still take my job very seriously and do the work to the best of my ability. I was promoted to assistant manager barely into my first year of work for the company. The most enjoyable part for me is seeing customers on a consistent basis that are pleasant and appreciate my service."
Safeway,1btk0qpeq5nb9f4o,2.0,I have worked for safeway for 3 years. I feel like there is no proper training for employees or management. Managers are lacking people skills and deal poorly with employees. Thoughts concerns and ideas are often disregarded. They are constantly in survival mode and rarely look at the whole picture. Managers need proper training in management. Skills as well as people management skills. Honestly the only reason I’m still there is the pay.
Safeway,1btj28neh1d0b0hr,4.0,"Company was going through a merger, cut labor too much to make bottom line look good.  Benefits were excellent.  Needed more staffing, pharmacist working alone is dangerous all around."
Safeway,1btira41n1d0b44h,1.0,Management is terrible here. You don't get paid what you should. Everyone only looks after themselves. The only good thing about safeway is you're union so you can't just get fired. I would not recommend anyone join the safeway company.
Safeway,1bti0djrr5nb9bql,3.0,you get to meet different people every day. theres always something new everyday working there . the past is slow the job is super easy anybody can do it if you just try
Safeway,1btgqiv52brfock1,5.0,"Great workplace. Comfortable work environments, great benefits, good pay, good communication between employees. i enjoyed my time at Safeway. If i could id work there again."
Safeway,1btgmskuob8bsa66,2.0,"poor management, extremely underpaid for work we had to do and very stressful at times. I did not like it at all wasnt really family environment and felt like every man for himself."
Safeway,1btg84cmk52v98ip,3.0,Typical day would be restocking shelves.  I only did restock so not much learned.  The management was very cool and helpful.  The hardest part was working late night.
Safeway,1btfofldv1d0b22n,1.0,"Worked at  Safeway for 2 1/2 years. I was promoted 3 times while working there because of my work ethic and performance. Mostly because no one wanted to work there. After being given one of the most important jobs in the store, Scan Coordinator or File Maintenance Manager, I was not given proper training or the required amount of help needed each week. After 6 months of working my tail off and getting the job done correctly and passionately. I was demoted due to seniority and then lied to about my future management training. This store in Canon City will stab you in the back even if you're one of there hardest workers. Do not recommend working here."
Safeway,1btffflr6ak4pdv4,3.0,"your experience here can be either good or bad, that just depends on who is managing your store. a usual day consists of being called up to check regularly. the hardest part would be getting your job done in time because of how busy the stores can get"
Safeway,1btffb4ddakcnbk8,5.0,Would be great olace to work if wages were higher.. Management team is Amazing  Stocking is very hard work..  Enjoyed while there .  Would have stayed if wages were higher..
Safeway,1bte2ussf5nb9d59,2.0,"Its okay to work here but it could be better. Love when they give you the opportunity to travel to different states to help out. Has much potential, but needs help"
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1btduifhlak8p8i8,3.0,"When you need to get some experience under your belt, its a great place to start. Management was mostly decent and helpful. The schedule was flexible. Co-workers generally had a positive attitude and made the job fun."
Safeway,1btdib4qq1d0n5jj,3.0,"Good job to have , good benifits when you get them."
Safeway,1btd6s6lrb8bs8c6,3.0,It is a stressful and terrible company to work for that has only gotten worse since the merger. A lot of retail management are leaving and needs to be addressed.
Safeway,1btd6dbjvbrfnejq,4.0,"Overall Safeway is a good company, however at our store Management does not do much to take care of you as an employee. He was sympathetic to personal needs but within the work place there is a lot of sub par equipment to lack of spending to make things efficient and safe."
Safeway,1btcqfv8452v9bc5,2.0,"At least in a Starbucks kiosk. These kiosks are licensed by safeway, so you don't get any of the corporate sbux benefits, and no one in safeway management cares about the state of the kiosk. You will run out of everything because no one cares to order. I tried to work as manager of the kiosk and was constantly trying to get management to give me the training and access required to run the kiosk, and they kept blowing me off (then getting mad when we had no supplies)."
Safeway,1btcpfgsnas0qc4j,5.0,"At Safeway, I learned how to communicate comfortably with the customers, approach customers and suggest products that we carried.  I enjoyed the busy atmosphere. There was always something that could be done, so there were no dull moments here.  The management was helpful and did a great job at caring her load of work duties and guiding her team of workers.  I loved the team that I worked with, and learned a lot working here. I gained confidence with the customer communication and pushed myself to learn as much as possible there. The hardest part of this job was the varied hours.  I worked all shifts because there were seniority above me who got first choice on their picks of the schedule, which usually left me the person in between.. I worked all of the shifts as needed but the schedule was never consistent.  Over time this became an issue for me. My health decreases tremendously and I suffered with insomnia and depression after leaving this job."
Safeway,1btbdkso7as0ne7s,3.0,"It was tiring, i only learned boxing baked things, making vases,taking care of flowers, making bouquets, the manager was bad, the culture was good, heavy lifting, too big stores and had to mop by hands, discounts on things,"
Safeway,1btb7mp4pb8bpdkc,5.0,Each day checking emails working with District Mgr. on tasks to complete and follow up on with staff at stores.
Safeway,1btb72kn3brfk8eq,5.0,"Each day reviewed emails, meet with selected store staff on marketing execution"
Safeway,1btausf7kakgl8co,4.0,The company was a good one to work for. The pay was good and the hours were long. The pay for per diem was good also. I learned many things from the people I worked for.
Safeway,1btapuihs1d0g7to,3.0,We had a very high turnover rate due to frequently cut hours and no managerial professionalism. But the staff of the store and co-workers were nice and tried their best.
Safeway,1btanr9i0as0nf2f,5.0,A typical day i ring up customers and help bag there groceries put them in the cart accasionally put the groceries back on the shelves the hardest part of the job is holding my temper.
Safeway,1btamoj6kbrfkboi,4.0,"i learned if someone wants your job you  better work harder. there is no taking someones job at Safeway unless you outwork them. i learned how to be a grocer, and i was good at it. management liked me because i got my job done no matter the work load or difficulty. i got to train people to help me Finnish the job, and watch them get better and faster with help and encouragement."
Safeway,1btam61e71d081fa,2.0,I wouldn't recommend this job to my worse enemy. I didint realize of toxic environment that was at this safeway until i quit. The place is a continue revolving door that cant seem to keep employees for more then 3 months
Safeway,1btaigarp1d0g63f,4.0,love the people I work with just poor management. Would recommend if you are in school. they are pretty flexible on hours. My store was really busy all the time so its pretty fast paced.
Safeway,1btagvjpe1d084kh,3.0,"Sadly, many of the managers were young and were not well trained or mentored. This led to micro-managing employees who were more knowledgeable and experienced than they were."
Safeway,1btaaq88nbrfkbpa,4.0,Days at work tend to be slow but learning in the store is non stop. Many things do to and learn about. Management was not as strict as you would expect but very focused on getting things done at work. The hardest part of the job was not getting many days off or no days off. I enjoyed learning new things and doing higher level position work.
Safeway,1bt920c8e1d080em,3.0,"Great company, must be flexible to work any shift, union regulated, premium benefits. Fast paced work in the deli, customers are awesome. If SafeWay wants you they will train you."
Safeway,1bt7u46ao1d084vi,2.0,Will put you in an environment hazardous to your health repeatedly without a second thought. Expect hours to be to low to pay the rent. Everyone is either on food stamps or has another job. They will keep hiring for your position and cu you from 15 hours a week to 8. At minimum wage that's not enough for anything. I have been there over 2 years and have never gotten a raise.
Safeway,1bt7s8oh61d0g0vi,4.0,I had a lot of fun working for Safeway. Employees and management was great. Everyone got along great with each other and work was achieved equally amongst employees. Duties kept me busy throughout my shift and made my day go by really fast. Costumers were kind and friendly.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bt7qo578b8bp8d4,4.0,"Definably wouldn't make a career out of it, but it was good while it lasted.  Very flexible schedule and I enjoyed the people I worked with.  Nice part time job to earn a little extra cash."
Safeway,1bt7cu16uakckag4,4.0,A typical work day here is all customer driven. Satisfied customers keep employee hours up. It is a team atmosphere. All departments work together. The hardest part of this job is caring for angry and unsatisfied customers. I enjoyed most was training employees and ensuring they were comfortable in their position they were hired to do. Being a resource at different levels was enjoyable because it was something different each time. This was not a routine day in and day out job. It posed many challenges due to unique situations.
Safeway,1bt65k0p4b87sd11,5.0,I enjoy going to work. I love dealing with a bunch of customers and different personalities. Handling cash constantly. It is a good job but I would love to do something more challenging.
Safeway,1bt603qcfb8becs4,5.0,Safeway was a great place to start when I was out of high school. Great advancement for younger adults to learn management skills. Not a life long job thou!
Safeway,1bt5v7n1gb87s8oh,2.0,this was a decent job but the manager expected the world out of his employees but we were not fairly compensated and were even told to go on strike. just crazy
Safeway,1bt5uj2tjb87sdqr,4.0,Lots of flexibility with schedule. Great for students and those who need flexibility. This position is also great for anyone who needs second job. Overall a good company.
Safeway,1bt5kft0nbrfbcrf,3.0,It was ok. Although you do get a work out seeing how you have to go push carts and collect baskets. I really don't have any complaints other then the assistant manager was racists
Safeway,1bt5bkus01ai93qc,3.0,"Deli work has its ups and downs. Some days were super busy some were slow. Working holidays was always busier than anyone would expect. Was trained to be fry cook. Cleaning the ovens, oil/grease traps, and even the roofs above, I discovered many smells that made me want to vomit."
Safeway,1bt4q34cjb87sbnd,5.0,The employees are usually fresh out of high school. Immediately I clicked with employees and bosses. Busy work with no down time but you make the best of it
Safeway,1bt4kp0ne1ba77eq,4.0,I enjoyed this job for many years. I liked mentoring my peers and helping them advance. I worked with a great team of hard working people.
Safeway,1bt33h1oub87sb4f,1.0,it could be better lack of hours and need to get paid more for bs. there is always a fight over more hours and always looking at the new schedule because senority is not important . it is based on availability
Safeway,1bt33bbtob83rcsl,3.0,"If you are a student, it's a great place to work. Otherwise, I would avoid it at all costs. Management doesn't care about their employees and is unwilling to work with you."
Safeway,1bt2rq9ce1ah33dr,5.0,"Me and my co-workers performed our jobs well, with little to no issues. The store was inhabitable, the pay I believe was okay for the work and everyone was great, from co-workers to customers."
Safeway,1bt2jsq8ub8bef83,4.0,"Fun place to work at,for a first level entry job, have learned a lot in the process of becoming a better at customer service, pay is not bad, however hours aren't that great."
Safeway,1bt0365cl1ah37ri,4.0,Wake up the same time everyday just to find out if you're working or not. always on-call never guaranteed hours. Guys you work with are awesome management can't really help with days working.
Safeway,1bsudtj9h5nencr9,2.0,The work in this company is wonderful but there is no physical stimulation and there are no functional names and promotion for everyone. For me it became boring because it did not support me physically and I look for any other job opportunity and better to be outside my country
Safeway,1bsua35j7b83r87j,3.0,"You don't get benefits unless you have been full time for over a year. Courtesy clerks do all the cleaning and are the bottom of the line in the store but if you are a good worker they will move you up fairly quickly. They moved me from courtesy clerk to bakery to fill someones position while on vacation, but moved me back to courtesy clerk because the bakery manager wanted someone with open availability. They then scheduled me to fuel station to close alone without my consent which I was not happy about at all. I ended up quitting shortly after because they seemed to cut my hours and not have much respect for me after I declined being moved to fuel."
Safeway,1bsu04mr3b87kfej,5.0,I still miss the smell of coffee and the bustle of orders. I would go back to this job in a heartbeat. It’s very fast paced but worth it and I still dream about how to make an order.
Safeway,1bstrg9nu1ba77aq,5.0,"I enjoy working in the deli, there is always something to do helping customers, cooking, cleaning and stocking. dept manager is always working with you"
Safeway,1bsth6iv9brfbbrb,4.0,"I worked in the deli department. My job was to restock the display cabinet, start the deep fryers, and pre the meats and cheese for the day. I was also in charge of restocking the deli department floor case and making sandwiches for customers upon request. The management was sometimes bad. They never really listened to the employees even when a complaint was made about another department manager. I enjoyed the people and working with the team we had."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bstb09i7b83r8m8,1.0,I hated this job with a passion poor management the staff were not that great either
Safeway,1bsrgehu6brfbc98,2.0,I did t care for the attitude or the rudeness of other people. It made me upset going to work and having people (I.e. my manager) yelling at me telling me how bad of a job I did.
Safeway,1bsr7npa3brfbeos,3.0,"the position I held was for the front deck customer service clerk. there was western union, money orders, lotto, lottery scratcher, rug doctor rentals."
Safeway,1bsr5ng6qb8bed8t,3.0,"Would be a better place if the management was not all women, they allowed personal life and emotions into work place I find Very Unprofessional might work for a different Safeway if the Managment was diverse."
Safeway,1bsr1m7rqb8befo4,3.0,Vons was a cool place to work when I was younger.  Great place to start a first job etc but I would not recommend staying for the long haul because you most likely will not make much money.
Safeway,1bsqs876ib8bef8l,4.0,"Typically good work days but changes are a constant; hardly a day is the same with daily orders change on how much sales are in 1 item or group. Frequent changes in salads or sandwiches based on sales. Supervisors are awesome. Management is not a personal get to know everyone type; all I knew was their name. Workplace culture loved working with everyone in my shift , all good people. The hardest part is the fact that graveyard shift didn't work for my body adjustment in sleep behaviors and family life."
Safeway,1bsqpqk9v1agl2g5,4.0,"Typically day of work was routine and never had an extreme variable change. Overnight hours make it hard to have both the work life and outside life of enjoyment as well as productivity harder then an average. The co-workers and Management were skilled and showed an understanding of there position equally, yet the companies wages were not competitive."
Safeway,1bsp4r9bubrf9ens,4.0,"Fun. Co-workers, leaving something every day, go I to work and right away it's overwhelmed depending on the department. Others are just as bad just not to bad."
Safeway,1bsoq5lt5b8bcdnk,3.0,"This was my second time working as a barista for a Starbucks store; however, this was a franchise exclusive to Safeway's and not a corporate Starbuck's store. Nonetheless, we were constantly busy and maintained a fun work atmosphere."
Safeway,1bsop7qgebrf9cu4,5.0,Normal workday includes doing everything that the managers ask and the standard job requirements listed under your job. The other employees are really helpful and kind.
Safeway,1bsoe34s6ak77ami,5.0,Great opportunities- a hard-working and quick-paced environment.   Lots of on the job training.  Lots of room for career growth and advancement.  Friendly work environment.
Safeway,1bso9bj53b83p861,1.0,Had to leave because the store manager was very harassing. Never wanted to work on nights. Got promoted as a checker an was happy an was looking forward to a raise. Never got one. And have been working full time on nightcrew for a year making $350 a week at the most when everyone else is making $700-$800/week
Safeway,1bso8g530b8bcdsd,5.0,"safeway is a fun but productive work place. It is fast pace but if you need a little help the co workers are always willing to help. Also, everyone in there is pretty friendly including the customers."
Safeway,1bsnun5jaakihafn,5.0,It was quite a good and friendly environment to work in a challenging role to prove yourself and show your skills. I love being an employee at this organization.
Safeway,1bsntj5ssak77dio,1.0,The store manager sets your departments hours....
Safeway,1bsnss03cb83pdon,2.0,"Terrible customer service. Short staffed front end & self check out is often not open. CHECK FOOD EXPIRATION DATES!!! This location is notorious for stocking expired food items. When informed, they don't remove it as we've seen the food still there on our next visit. Frozen items have been several MONTHS past the best by date."
Safeway,1bsnqdt005nal8vp,5.0,"i enjoyed working at safeway, the hours was nice, the manager was nice  to get along and the work was not hard. the store was always clean, and co-workers helped you if you needed help with something."
Safeway,1bsmm6o9iaqj1e1m,3.0,Each day brings something new with company but the company has changed from when I first begin working here. It used to be fun to go to work and time passed quickly because it was fun and things were getting done.
Safeway,1bsmhkmj8b87i8k7,4.0,Typical workday of a Night Clerk Grocer consisted of a very fixed schedule that mainly relied on staying on a schedule. Working to restock shelves at night and cleaning up afterward. Making the store presentable was a must and management would get upset when there was no time to do so. The day to day schedule always remained the same.
Safeway,1bsmgeg9kb8bcf3d,3.0,I felt we gave good customer service. I learned how to run the cash registers and make Starbucks coffee. The hardest part was learning all he different drinks.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bsm9e3nvb87ifev,3.0,"Management was lousy, but co-workers were nice and helpful.  Only worked there as a clerk part-time for a few days, so did not really get to have a real feel for how it was to work their long term.  It was out of my field as a Business Analyst, so I really cannot comment accurately."
Safeway,1bsm3ef0pb87iavp,4.0,The managers at Safeway where very demanding but did not have the preparation necessary to give constructive criticism. I worked at the Starbucks and we were not allowed to receive tips.
Safeway,1bsm2m4ppb83peno,5.0,great company to work for. Friendly employees. Benefits are amazing. Relocated for my husbands job or would have stayed. Management very supportive . .
Safeway,1bsm106s8ak77apg,3.0,"Didnt like pay wasnt willing to give raise. Wouldn't work with hours. Needed that because of my kids. Manager was not to friendly, some other co workers werent very friendly"
Safeway,1bslrt5ve5nalah8,3.0,"This company was a great place for first experience in the workforce and learning to deal with all sorts of people. Working in the Starbucks kiosk located in side Vons, I was responsible for preparing drinks for customers and making sure they left the store with a positive experience. Management was good, with room for improvement in caring for employers as well as customers. The hardest part was working alone on busy nights trying to manage multiple tasks in an efficient manner. On the other hand, there were fun times doing sales events through announcements and sample tastings  to promote higher sales from the Starbucks department."
Safeway,1bsklftgfb8bcd2c,4.0,Schedule sucked bad. Hard to get day off. Requested more than 2 weeks in advanced got the okay and then scheduled to work. Managers weren’t on the same page.
Safeway,1bsk8eq9gb83iaqs,2.0,Daily basis staff is not trained to work effectively. Manager and the manager of the store disagree with order of work to be done on a daily basis. Need to get work assignments in writing to ensure that you do the work that is needed
Safeway,1bsk4r2kgb83if3m,1.0,"there are better grocery stores to work at. management is greedy and not forgiving. overall not a good experience, maybe recommended for younger kids."
Safeway,1bsk3tfdfb8b6cei,1.0,Come in and get yelled at for something someone else did. I learned absolutely nothing. The management was Horrible. The workplace culture...there wasn't any. The hardest part of the job...just being there. There was no enjoyable part of the job.
Safeway,1bsjufi1u5neff3n,2.0,bad place to work. work is too demanding for too little pay. with minimum benefits. work place is stressful and tiring. very slow pace of career advancement.
Safeway,1bsjsmfd4ak6q911,3.0,I learned a lot working for Safeway. I worked all over the store. My hours varied and there was a lot of drama. It lacked job advancement. I can't say I enjoyed a whole lot.
Safeway,1bsjn5e7hakeleln,1.0,If management didn't like you then good luck advancing. Hard work doesn't pay off because no matter how hard you worked you wouldn't get recognition and always get yelled at for not doing something. the hardest part about working there was the other employees because they were lazy and didn't work and the management because they didn't care about you. A typical day at safeway was working hard and getting in trouble for something that you had no control over. Management is fixed there and everyone talked about you no matter what it was. I learned that you cant trust no one and not to rely on anyone.
Safeway,1bsjm7c5jbrf3e7f,5.0,"Albertsons-Safeway Company is one of the largest food and drug retailers with 2,300+ stores.

Safeway,1bsjigbfp5nefc3n,3.0,"It is a good job, not a career though.Pay is terrible. You can work at the crack dawn one day, then super late the next day. They can schedule you any time they want."
Safeway,1bsjh7b9cakelf3j,1.0,Poor management and extremely dirty working conditions where I didn't feel comfortable serving food out of our kitchen. Gross. No management and constant bickering between everyone. Don't waste your time here.
Safeway,1bsjevj7r5j6bdl9,3.0,"It's an okay job to start but don't expect very much. For a start, its okay and there are a few opportunities for advancement(at least where I was) but it is not something you want to stay at for the long term. there is not much else to say its an average work environment."
Safeway,1bsje51ejb87bdbq,3.0,Enjoyed working night shift. I was able to get a lot done with very few distractions it was nice to feel like we accomplished a lot every night. It was an enjoyable job.
Safeway,1bsj2r6c7aqird8a,1.0,would never work there again. Did not enjoy working for this company I no longer shop at this company. I mean what more do u want me to say about a company who does not care about thier employees.
Safeway,1bsiv54cnaqira53,5.0,"A typical workday as a Safeway employee involves clocking in, signing into the system, turning on the isle light, processing customer transactions, and very often bagging groceries with one or two 10 minute breaks between a 6-8 hour shift. Its a very straightforward position with very few surprises.  The main concern is customer service which isn't so bad considering you'll occasionally meet very interesting regulars with unique personalities.  Working the closing shift can be fairly easy if you know how to manage your additional closing duties after which most of your time will be spent walking around merchandising to Old School Rhythm and blues/Rock radio."
Safeway,1bsgqh43tb87b9ve,3.0,Safeway is good for a first job or a part time job while attending school. Benefits are not available unless working 32+ Hours every week. Management plays favorites and does not work well with problems outside of work.

Safeway,1bsfq8kto52uhb6u,1.0,"Management could have been better. Training wasn't completed with full understanding of department, lack of correct tools for department. Outdated system."
Safeway,1bsf5grqfb87bfqp,2.0,"They could care less about overworking you, or the fact you have a family to go home to. They have mandatory ""day off"" work days. So good luck making plans on your day off. They give you a schedule, however it's not what it says it will be. The management cares nothing about you. It pays good and gives you benefits. Expect to have an unexpected schedule, and have NO personal life as you will be exhausted at times."
Safeway,1bse9crj6b8b6eu6,2.0,"Once I was in the position of Assistant Store manager I worked 50-60 hours a week on salary. I was over used and under appriciated. I performed many tasks that typical grocery clerks should be hired for. I had too much to do on a daily basis and felt set-up for failure. didn't appricated the district managers approach. Not very personable. My last store manager had issues with anger and rage. Mistreated employees and got promoted to a nicer, bigger store."

Working at Safeway I am meeting so many interesting people from all over with amazing stories and experiences to share."
Safeway,1bsbukipsb87bdsg,3.0,Every day was different because I worked in many different departments. I learned skills in customer service and management. The culture at Safeway was fast paced.
Safeway,1bsbdak4rb87bcjf,2.0,its a very stressful enviroment and very poor management. well the one i worked at anyway. The people that do work there just make it hard to even work or want to go to work.
Safeway,1bsb70kbnb8b68ap,5.0,Almost everyone knows about Safeway as a company and knows that it has been bought out so if you do decide to work for Safeway make sure it is at a store that they do not plan on closing

Safeway,1bs9996erb83idua,2.0,"To be fair I can only speak about the Deli because that's the department I worked in, but this wasn't a great first job. My co-workers were crabby and the training for the job was very poor."
Safeway,1bs98ppn1aqiqa7u,2.0,Safeway was a job I acquired while training for a new job. They worked with my school schedule and my immediate supervisor was supportive. The requirements of employees are a bit scripted but getting to know regular customers was nice.
Safeway,1bs95ck37b87ba4v,3.0,"I liked some days going into work, when everyone was there. Other days I hated it the deli was busy, we where under employeed and people who where getting hired would quick because of hours or pay. I gay my 2 weeks notice because I felt working hard and getting underpaid was unhealthy for me."
Safeway,1bs94o5i7akauef4,3.0,"its all about numbers and the big guys getting their paycheck. the little people don't matter, although the store wouldn't be able to operate without us! it was an awesome company to work for, until they got bought out by Albertsons and they have destroyed everything that Safeway stood for!"
Safeway,1bs94bh1eb83i8j1,1.0,"I would not recommend this position to an enemy let alone a friend.  Management really does not know what they are doing ""Trev"" Store Manager.

Safeway,1bs8s2tno5nefeom,2.0,Corporate B.S. should sum it up... Cutting hours and upping the workload. Its a grocery store and its treated like its life and death with the use of threats from management.
Safeway,1bs8r35q6b87behe,2.0,I worked with this company for a little over a year and was tricked into thinking moving from a courtesy clerk to a cashier was a promotion when in fact i found out i could have just applied for the job. I was used and manipulated into thinking my job was on the line constantly and when i decided to leave i was harassed and got a major hour cut because of it.
Safeway,1bs8q93ns52uh8b1,3.0,"No advancement in position. Don't expect help in a department if you're overwhelmed. Lower management is nice, higher management is awful. Pay rates are incredibly poor and inconsistent between departments and employees. Ridiculous turn-over rate."
Safeway,1bs8o9qd85j6bd3o,5.0,Good people and a fun environment.  This position was temporary but a good way to learn a different facade of the industry.  I was able to gain experience and insight in the field direction I wanted to pursue.
Safeway,1bs747hj9brev8nf,4.0,"was a great group of people there who have yet to be used to their full potential. The right person to tap the culture, the knowledge and their experiences that already exist in a great company, will usher Safeway into the 22nd century with ease"

Safeway,1brkm6qdrb8atc12,3.0,The job requires a base amount of knowledge around a computer. There is a lot of specialized training for the internal software and custom form of Windows. The atmosphere is somewhat relaxed but the workload requirements exceed the compensation.
Safeway,1brki5bunaqii8t6,3.0,This all applies to the store that I worked at specifically. The manager is greedy and is only worried about herself. Same with the produce manager who behaves unethically and immorally.
Safeway,1brkfdsr05na7e9h,4.0,Hired as a Phlebotomy Supervisor but Safeway cancelled the program.  I was asked to stay on and they would pay for my training as a Pharmacy Technician.

Safeway,1bri9s5coakebe5i,3.0,Have to be a good multi-tasker. Can be stressful at times. Budget was hard to obtain. Goals are high to bonus. A lot expected of everyone.Typical day is over 10 hours and doesn't stop from the time you walk in to the time you leave. Never really feel like your ahead ever. Work short handed a lot and end up picking up the slack for over paid lazy workers.Days go fast which is a plus.
Safeway,1bri16v30b8at90b,3.0,"i love the people i work with & the managers are great. But, in my opinion, the deli is the worst department to be in. They get the rudest customers & i absolutely hate coming home everyday smelling the chicken grease."

Safeway,1brffk6r3b8arfa4,3.0,I worked at a tough store so im not sure if its the store or the company but I've had stories about people having to go to the union to get the pay that they were supposed to be getting. Lots of customers have stole from the store and the have been stabbing at the store along with a man being passed out in the bathroom from the drugs he's been on. people have showered in the bathroom. almost every night the police had to be called. one time an employee got knocked out back when it was a 24 hour store. but like I said it was a bad store... the only good story I can think of is that for a little bit there we had a really good store manager but before I left they transfered him.
Safeway,1brfe3gjrb870b2n,4.0,Safeway was a nice first place to work but after a while it was annoying. They don't stop hiring so when we don't bring in enough money the hours get cut to like 4 hrs a week. Most of the managers are nice besides the new store manager.

I am still employed there but I am looking to obtain a career and not just a job. Safeway does not appreciate hard working people. Instead when they see your a hard worker they place to  much upon you and let the slackers just cruise by without any expectations. It is not a good balance, I feel if you treat your employees good they in return treat the customers good and business benefits from that."
Safeway,1br4d40qsak6c9g3,4.0,"Safeway can be a fun place to work. Front end/cashiers or cashier assistants can be great for part-timers, especially students. Different departments (i.e. Bakery, Deli)  can be a great job for full timers."

When I was working in the deli, they would force me to wash dishes for 4 hours (managers said nobody should get stuck doing dishes for more than an hour) and even when the chemicals began to eat the skin on my hands (couldn't seem to avoid this even with gloves) and I had to go to the doctor, they still attempted to make me do dishes. They would try to make me do duties that were intended for them. If I requested a day off (i.e. for a musical recital for school) they would punish me by giving me undesirable hours. When I asked for less hours, they brought me down to 8 hours a week. This place was awful."

After transferring to the bakery and becoming a baker/cake decorator I really enjoyed my job and received 2 weeks of paid time off per year, and paid sick leave as well as the other benefits. I was getting paid somewhat higher than minimum wage with regular salary increases and the option to achieve journeyman status, which would have raised my wages above $15/hr. However, the job was somewhat stressful and it was important to work quickly with a sense of urgency. I wish I had not left my job as a baker/cake decorator."

Safeway,1bqr5m92takdtabu,3.0,I thought that the job was very exhausting even though I was only a cashier.  Like when there wasn't enough cashiers they would hound you to stay longer. I never got off on time.
Safeway,1bqr3kf18as27d45,5.0,"I learned a variety of tasks including bagging groceries, cleaning, moving grocery carts, taking care of customers, and stocking groceries.  Management was great to work with.  The toughest part of the job was dealing with occasional angry customers, but the best part of the job was bonding with my coworkers."

Safeway,1bqqqen88as27cmb,3.0,"I was a courtesy clerk, the job was appropriate for the time in my life as a high schooler.  It really didn't pay that much at the time, it was even below what minimum wage is right now, but paid appropriate for the type of work and how I was in life."
Safeway,1bqqgmpilas278s0,5.0,Everyday I had great customers come in and ask for my help specifically. I enjoyed laughter and jokes with my manager. It wasn't much to learn but bettering your social skills.

Safeway,1bqo48vpbb86l8c1,3.0,A typical work day for me was punching in and starting to get carts and start to clean or bag for customers. From what I learned while working at Safeway is always stay focused and on task. The management at the downtown Bellevue store was very demanding but still good.
Safeway,1bqnhjgce52tue2a,4.0,Worked on sales floor and interacted with customers and other employees through the work day. Worked at a set pace and rarely had no work to do as it was usually very busy.

Safeway,1bqlq83vlb82qet8,2.0,"Never any training, it's who you know not what you know. Benefits are terrible no vision plan and mandatory union dues are taken out of the paycheck. Pay system is very confusing. Managers lack any leadership knowledge and ceos and upper management lack in understanding individual and group job roles while demanding and expecting way too much for the little financial compensation given."
Safeway,1bqlkosvjakhpevj,5.0,Never a dull moment. A typical day is fast pace and never boring.You can't help learning something new every day.

Safeway,1bqlb11q05j5qcqg,5.0,"Safeway had very good management. their pay is poor, and most department jobs were demeaning. it is only a good place to work as a manager in their different departments, and a job for high school students learning about the work force."

Safeway,1bqjoil58b86l8gv,3.0,"I liked the customers, most were kind and fun. I enjoyed the supervisors. I didn't like not being able to work more hours so that I may have benefits. The supervisors were professional and fun to work with. We were a particularly busy store and I wished we could have had more check stands, as it was all check stands were full. They were very consistent about breaks and ensuring we were given for our breaks as scheduled. I liked that I was able to be taught more about the workings of the store by not just checking, but learning how to tag the merchandise. Overall, this was an extremely fast paced, high stress position, that was fun."
Safeway,1bqjh8qdpaka6dk2,3.0,It was an ok place to work would never consider working there again but it was overall just ok. The customers were always rude and the managers never had our backs.

Safeway,1bqe80hdtb82jco7,3.0,"10 years I worked for safeway and I don't have much to say about it. Wasn't the best job, I stayed because I was comfortable. Very stressful and demanding. Manegment only cares about less employees but same work load. Cutting hours to increase their bonuses."

Safeway,1bqe2bbc1b8acchu,1.0,"Typical Day: Understaffed, complaints, never good enough"
Safeway,1bqe0s7ajbread5s,3.0,"A very good workplace, overall. Just very under-appreciated, under-funded, and under-employed. Corporate regulations are nonsensical. they award hours to departments based on how well they're doing. If a department does not pass muster, they get less hours for their employees, leading to an even worse state. Even more worse, the manager is blamed by corporate for this new mess."
Safeway,1bqdsf7ejb8acdi2,3.0,Come in with the mindset that it's super busy and a lot of people come in and out but just take a deep breath and smile and be positive. And just do what ever the person in charge tells u that way u don't get in trouble

Safeway,1bqdi4n4eb8ac877,3.0,"A day at work was always good due to the fact that as soon as you clocked in the day began. The fast paste cleaning, keep the store looking nice, stocking back items that were misplaced. Keeping the shopping carts filled with carts. The hardest part of the job was trying to bag the groceries fast without ripping the bags, which you get the hang of. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with your co workers. When it slows down a small talk while cleaning or putting back stocked items makes your day go by faster and before you know it, it's time for you to clock out."
Safeway,1bqdeap9v52tockd,4.0,Safeway has a good working environment. It is a company that provides skill building opportunities. A  typical day of work involves helping customers and being a team player.

Safeway,1bqcdtp5eb82jc6q,2.0,"Wonderful employees, negative upper management. Constantly understaffed with overload on workers with minimum wage. Very inflexible with employees' schedule needs. Did not return because it wouldn't have been possible to work out solid daycare for my child and have the pay be worth it. Okay job for a part time employee/ student."
Safeway,1bqc4s475b86gc8q,4.0,"Great company to work with if you don't want to advance. At 4 years in, I am at the top of my available pay scale. Just 4 years.

Safeway,1bqbnas6kb8acdpb,4.0,"I started off as a courtesy clerk and two years later I did not expect my self to still work here. I am now a food clerk and a part time PIC (person in charge, $21/hr). For this reason that I am now getting a shot at the person in charge position is why I am still at Safeway, me being 20 years old this is the best pay I could receive as of now and that's why my Safeway time has been decent. I feel that the experience of working at Safeway relies heavily on the type of manager that you have and the work culture that surrounds you created by co workers and customers."
Safeway,1bqbi40mobreafkr,1.0,thy have a habbet of suspending you for the smallest thing for a week
Safeway,1bqbde0krbreaagb,1.0,"My direct manager was okay, and there some people there that were awesome to work with; we're still friends. But the company, similar to many non-tech companies, looks at technology as a necessary evil, emphasis on evil. Additionally, in my particular situation, it was a hostile work environment, with one employee who would never be retained in most professional companies."
Safeway,1bqb6gpjhb86gdi3,3.0,* Rarely have any idle time as there's always something to do.
Safeway,1bqaknshcbreafsv,2.0,"I did not enjoy working at Safeway.  The management at this company expected employees to be available to work the entire day, without any regard to the employee's personal life.  Employees are penalized for asking for time off."
Safeway,1bq9p6slt5j5if5l,4.0,"It's a pretty good place to work depending of course on management and the people you have the pleasure of spending the majority of your time with. There aren't a lot of advancement opportunities, and you get to know the good and bad of whatever neighborhood you end up working in. Other than all that it's a nice enough place to come in, get some management experience, and move on."
Safeway,1bq99j2pcb86g8sc,2.0,If you've ever been to a party with several dozen people you despise then you've probably got a pretty good idea what it's like working here.
Safeway,1bq910kv6b8ac9l2,3.0,Any company that offers full healthcare benefits to part-time employees (20+ hours) is a great company. Definitely worth looking into. Pay could be better but it is definitely industry competitive.

Safeway,1bps12kmrbre4dss,5.0,On your average work day it was always consistent in knowing what needed to be done.
Safeway,1bprsi5qsb8a6evt,4.0,"I worked on the night crew so my position had a more stable work schedule than other departments.  It is very busy and stressful during holidays.  The pay rate varies depending on which department you work in, however there are regular pay raises, paid vacation and health benefits.  There is also an opportunity for overtime work. There is the ability to transfer to another department that suits you better or work up to management positions.  There is a lot of standing on concrete floors, walking, bending and heavy lifting, so the jobs can be very physically demanding. You are dealing with customers all day, so if you are a people person it is a good job.  Sometimes the managers can expect more work from the employees than is realisticly possible to do, which can be frustrating.  Overall I enjoyed my time working for Safeway and would recomend it to job seekers."

Safeway,1bprggs07b868fi7,2.0,"Not a bad place to be a staff pharmacist. Expectations on pharmacy manager with the help provided is overwhelming.  Management above the in store level can not do your job, so how do they expect you to get it all done?"

Safeway,1bppk7i88b865c43,5.0,"Hours were always available. Unfortunately I was fired for violating company policy on approaching known thieves.

Safeway,1bpndufonb8659gk,3.0,"This job is incredibly physically demanding. Not only do you have to be physically fit enough to handle the required weight limit for lifting, but extra training for safety measures, which are considerable, should be mandatory and revisited once per year."
Safeway,1bpnahvrlb865fo3,3.0,"Hard work, fast paced, stressful my good team in my deli, my Mngr appreciates her team and treats us well.   It takes a while to work up the ladder and get hours, expect to work harder, better, and faster than others around you if you want good shifts etc.  Stronger workers will carry the load for lesser dedicated workers.  You will not be paid more based on your performance but you may get better shifts and your Manager will hopefully appreciate your dedication.  As in all jobs, you will find some favoritism, do not expect a completely equal playing field, you are dealing with human beings and people tend to do what works best for them, some Managers balance this better than others, your mileage may vary."
Safeway,1bpmt71tcaqhl9fq,4.0,"Fast paced,  challenging and many opportunity's."
Safeway,1bpmntrgfas1n8r9,3.0,"Safeway was a complete waste of time. They make you work with unions, so you pay a good portion of your paycheck to them for little to no help.

Safeway,1bpfk04r0b89tfi2,4.0,Fast paced environment that keep you on your toes. The hardest part was taking calls from angry customers. Management keep you aware of your progress on a bi-weekly basis. The most enjoyable part is the friendly and helpful co-workers.
Safeway,1bpfjtsvkb8609jt,4.0,Overall good job. Didn't care for the Deli clerk position and was unable to transfer to a different position within the store due to lack workers in the deli dept.
Safeway,1bpfgvt5takhdcab,5.0,Safeway consisted mostly of cleaning the gas station and reorganizing the snacks. I mostly worked all alone for my shifts but it was okay since there was plenty to clean. I would also help people pump gas and I really got to work on my customer service skills with this job. The most stressful part was when I'd be alone on my shift and cleaning outside and customers would come inside the store and I hadn't known.
Safeway,1bpfam6kuaqhk9om,1.0,"come in start my cooking and regular duties. I learded that i have to look out for myself because as much as they smile in your face they dont mean well. management has 0 cares about anyone especially if your trying to better yourself. hardest part of the job is working 6 days a week while going to school, volunteering and having tutoring to attend and you ask for another day off and they say NO! leaving is the most enjoyable part of the job"

Management is okay meaning 50/50 some employs  get treated better then others, which is unfair for everyone. nothing hard about the job. its fast learning quick to catch on. prefer to be in a better pleasant environment"
Safeway,1bpddv0jebrdteo2,1.0,The work it's self is fine. But when you mix in everyone's drama and complaining it becomes like high school or middle school. Management doesn't care about you only care about getting their bonuses. There always seems to be someone at the grocery store that will always try to get in your business and start drama. Best to lay low and talk to as few people as possible. I worked graveyard stocking shelfs which was good except for the hours.

Safeway,1bpbs62unaqhibej,3.0,"The daily routine was inconsistent. Employee call-ins proved to be a daily problem, and labor controls were tight. Often a heavy workload with little help."
Safeway,1bpag4c4bb820b7s,4.0,Retail pharmacy was a new environment for me at the time but I enjoyed working at Safeway.  The pharmacy technicians were very nice and helpful in the busy environment.
Safeway,1bpae4lqdb8208i4,3.0,"Doesn't take a whole lot of effort to become any sort of manager. With inexperienced managers, the turnover per department and in the stores is uncomfortably high. To the point that making an effort to learn peoples names becomes a joke. With that said, I learned a ton about customer service and how the grocery business works in general."
Safeway,1bp9toem4aqhiapp,5.0,"I cleaned off the salad and sandwich bars, Cut meat and cheese to the customer's liking, Stock the salad and sandwich bars, Sweep and mop the floor, Washed the dishes."
Safeway,1bp9odr2cb89p9vi,2.0,"Management could be good or bad depending on the person. The company as a whole seems to squeeze as much work for as little pay as possible from employees. Overall, not a company that I would recommend to most who want to make a career out of something they enjoy."
Safeway,1bp9joda3brdpe0f,3.0,it was an acceptable job. courtesy clerk work is the grunt work of the store so be prepared to do just about anything and everything. the people are nice but you will work like a grunt
Safeway,1bp9gd0ua5ndeepd,1.0,I learned  something about that store .ill will never see it the same. the customers are amazing and very chatty.No comments on management.the thing that i miss the most is the fresh bread.
Safeway,1bp87uuub5nd7b86,4.0,I like meeting new people. But every week the hours change. It's good if you get promoted. So far there isn't any advancement for me. It's good we get paid every Thursday.
Safeway,1bp86fpg3b85jemm,1.0,"no one who works there is treated well our store manager was awful very rude and disrespectful , the even cut hours if you were sick or got hurt or didnt want to come in on a day off"
Safeway,1bp84ki6i5j54d9h,3.0,Good working place but i find the job as a service clerk as some kind of stressful and the pay to me isn't encouraging especially for a college graduate. Therefore an adjustment to pay and other benefits would be a nice form of incentives.
Safeway,1bp7vekuc5j54ddm,4.0,"Typical work experience in a privately owned company. Friendly Boss and co- workers, friendly and clean and safe environment. Great starter job..with possibility to go from temporary to permanent position."
Safeway,1bp77a71k5j54f28,3.0,"Advancement opportunities are wonderful. However, there isn't a set schedule so your hours and scheduled days may lack consistancy. Paid vacations and wonderful benefits."
Safeway,1bp72ql3r5nd7ehq,4.0,"I grew up in that town and got to see old friends parents and old teachers, I was there for the summer away from college and it was a fun, easy way to talk to people and make some money."
Safeway,1bp6r8cpqb85jef2,2.0,"literally felt like and was treated like aslave every day I clocked in. Management doesn't care about you as a person, only about ""hitting the numbers."" Employee moral lower then I've seen anywhere else."
Safeway,1bp6o49utaqheee1,5.0,"Although fast-paced, Safeway is a great place to work. The Benifits are great. I worked there for 9 1/2 years and feel like they are family. I loved that I felt challenged every day to get the job done and do it well."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bp6n5426b85jffk,4.0,I personally think that Safeway could improve on the hourly pay. The workers bust their butt off to make our managers proud and also the customers. But overall I enjoyed working at Safeway cause ive made plenty of good friends who become family to me.
Safeway,1bp5upebib81m9ps,5.0,Most Safeways i've been to are pretty cool. Everyone one just wants to get things done and have a decent time doing it. When disputes happen it is due to miscommunication and is resolved quickly.
Safeway,1bp57nn5kbrdi895,3.0,"Courtesy Clerk was an easy job, but when I was there the pay was about $9.57 without taxes and union dues coming out. Everyone expects a lot out of you even though you are the lowest paid employee there which doesn't make sense to me."
Safeway,1bp4vto2gb81me9b,2.0,"Workplace culture, had great friends with co workers, learned time management and quick thinking to solve various tasks. stayed for 9 years and learned an experience"
Safeway,1bp4u3ecmb85ja5b,1.0,The company is not stable they treat employees like slaves. Employees are  treated bad and rode all the time. The work load is dangerous. It is a horrible way to work.
Safeway,1bp4icietb89gfko,3.0,This was a job I had while in High School and during the summer. It was a decent job to have and it was a good experience and taught me a decent amount about customer service.

Safeway,1bp26umrib85j9qq,3.0,Not enough help
Safeway,1bp2058p752tb9pc,5.0,Great atmosphere to work in. I learned a lot this this being my first job. The pay was good for first starting out in customer service and hours were not bad either.
Safeway,1bp1ucucu52tb8qf,4.0,"A typical day in File Maintenance depends on whether you are putting up the sale tags overnight on Tuesday', working during the day during the week or weekend. Tuesday nights a person is just hanging tags, the rest of the time a person is hanging tags, making display signs and hanging those signs.  The weekend is the same as the weekdays with fewer tags and signs. File Maintenance is great as a 2nd job. While in this position I learned how to print tags and apply price changes. The hardest part was working overnight once a week while the most enjoyable part was helping the customers. Management is reasonable and easy to work with.  The culture is easygoing."
Safeway,1bp1niullb89gasf,4.0,"enjoyed the company and regret no longer working for them, i did several grand openings and managed meat department all over the bay area. I was considered tp be if not the best manager,  i was one of the best."

Safeway,1bovgltk9b85jb17,3.0,"Working at Safeway was a challenge during the busy times, but I loved my customers and did what I could to give them a good experience. I got along well with my co-workers."
Safeway,1bov4c3kd52tbekq,1.0,"If you enjoy working on your days off and working long hours for less than $10 per hour then this is for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere. They will expect you to work 2 employees positions at a time when your dept is short handed. I am currently going into week 4 of this type of situation and having a promotion being held in front of me but with no straight answers as to when the position will be posted. I am doing all of the work for that position as well as whatever other position I am assigned to that day. My schedule shifts between 2am-12:30pm and 11:30am-8pm multiple times per week and I feel like I barely have time to sleep in-between shifts."
Safeway,1bouuslkk52tbc7b,3.0,"The pay and benefits are above average, even giving a fair amount of paid time off. However, the amount of work required by upper (out of store) management is inconsistant with the known amount of help/hours that were given to each department/store.  Hard work is not seemingly appreciated, and was often only met with criticism on other aspects that may not have been completed."
Safeway,1boul256db81md3q,4.0,Love it was the best place to work the discount was nice love the brake room and my co workers and staff would love to be still working for Giantfood store
Safeway,1botasj9jb89g9ce,4.0,Usually getting up early leaving to work i learned to do more things as i worked there management was O.K. i would've like a more nicer and appreciative management
Safeway,1bot30iagbrdfa9i,3.0,Every store is operated differently. My first store was great good people very fun to work with like family. Even similar to that family member you have that dosen't like you but you come together when family is in need of help to get the job done when necessary. The 2nd store I was sent too not as welcoming completely different environment than the first scenario. My first week there I was not shown around where I could feel comfortable or shown their procedure. They were mistrusting and rude. My last 2 weeks I worked a total of 8hrs. People that had been there for a long time got the most hours apparently.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bot2d83vbrdf8fa,2.0,"I would never tell a friend, family member, my worst enemy to apply or work at Safeway. Safeway is a cut throat company and can't keep people because of that."
Safeway,1bot2c885b81m8b0,4.0,Didnt't really dislike it I actually had fun when i worked there. There is on and off days to any job but i still kind of felt like a team player and a friend to my fellow coworkers and managers.
Safeway,1bospbolbaqhedk9,4.0,I would say that this job was definitely temporary for me. I remember it was fast paced and competitive. I did not really care much for this job. I would rate it good though.
Safeway,1borgsn1ob85edj4,1.0,"My first few weeks at this job were okay, but as soon as one of the worst supervisors got promoted to a ""front 'manager'"" position is when everything went downhill for me. The work environment is very toxic. Co-workers talk behind your back and rumors are spread all over about everyone. Even the managers are involved in all the drama. Management shows favoritism and sometimes even discrimination. I would often get chewed out for taking initiative while others would chill in the meat department for hours and nothing would happen to them."
Safeway,1borf69vbakh29u2,5.0,Safeway has been around for quite a while. Some stores dont pay as well as they should and others over pay. The real money begins to role in when the employee themself becomes a supervisor or has put in 8 plus years of service. All tools and experience providing to ensure success of the company as well as the auccess of each employee.
Safeway,1bore85dtb85ea4u,2.0,"standing for 8 hours two ten minutes and 1 hour lunch. the ten minute ""breaks"" are useless because once your on the ten minutes you dont want to go back to work its almost better not to have the breaks and just keep work"
Safeway,1bor78dobb89c8vs,3.0,This job was just a job. worked graveyard shift  stocking shelves with other pretty alright coworkers. not much else to say. The hours were okay I guess.
Safeway,1bor1gmptb85ed8c,2.0,"I'm a veteran employee. With this purchase made by Albertsons of Safeway and their banners, has been the worst. Albertson's core values are no longer in sight. Dignity, respect no longer exist. The hard work, that was invested in making Albertsons a strong company, has been systematically destroyed with the Safeway/Vons culture."
Safeway,1boqsm9s0b85eb8o,3.0,Busy place to work. People can be friendly and helpful. They give 1 hour lunches. Which can be good when you have appointments. Some jobs can be demanding.
Safeway,1boqjmekdbrdbd5i,4.0,"Safeway is a good company to work for. They do employee young adults who haven't learned how to treat their fellow workers. There was an air of favoritism, and how some employees were treated by management."
Safeway,1boq83htab89cfcd,4.0,Safeway had high energy with employees eager to go and help customers when needed. Employees and Management carried smiles on their faces and was very friendly. There was a lot of down time but work was high energy with much movement. Management was friendly and would look offer ways to work with the employees and provide help. A typical day at work consisted of communicating with customers and providing help when needed. I learned how to communicate better with customers and how to be as helpful as possible around the work place. The workplace culture was very friendly and high energy. We could joke around and everyone was willing to help in some way. The hardest part of the job would be during the rush hour points when the store was full and we had to manage to take care of many customers with little to no break time. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to connect with many different characters
Safeway,1boq7ub8pb85edkp,1.0,"i believe that a typical day at work can be stressful. i learn alot of things there because  you have to. the management is not that good at all, like something happends and you report it they dont move a muscle. i have nothing to say about workplace culture. hardest part of the job is been by yourself and doing everything when you have customer services to deal with. the most enjoyable part of the job is when is time to go."
Safeway,1boq3ij3lakd3d39,4.0,"A typical day at work for safeway includes clocking in and going to your station to begin work.

Safeway,1boot9cgtb89cd96,3.0,not much to say. its a job .
Safeway,1booge7thakd3dsn,4.0,Very decent job with plenty of room for advancement for those with the drove and ambition. I worked for them before the buyout so I can't really speak to its current state.
Safeway,1boo8dkemakh2b0f,5.0,"a typical day starts at 4:30 am, once you get everything up and running, you begin customer service. I've learned so much working for Vons. I learned to deal with different people.Everyone inst always happy but when you provide great customer service you could actually change someones day and attitude.I honestly feel as though management could have been more personable.The hardest part of my job would have to had been working the loads. the most enjoyable thing would have had to been working with the people i was working with and customers. As much as i made their days, their positive energy and feedback made my day."
Safeway,1boo6sdc3b89cah0,4.0,"Safeway is decent place to work, But once you get into management the expectations of the job sometimes are unrealistic.  Its supposed to be a family workplace but its anything but.  If something happens with daycare or family issues its very hard to get off work, manly only in management."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.

Safeway,1boo3muvhb81ic6t,1.0,"i learned Excellent problem solving skills and outgoing, friendly and impeccable customer service skills. The hardest part of working for this company was i was not given enough hours, and when i would get hours they would make me push carts the whole day because they had no other courtesy clerks."

Safeway,1boo2u681akd39or,5.0,"A typical day at work currently consists of stocking product onto shelves, cleaning and dusting shelves, discarding out of date or old product, and rotating product as well.  There are an opening, mid-day, and closing shift employees that work in this department on a daily basis.   The main goal each day is to ensure we have the product the customer wants, and it is kept full and fresh on our shelves to ensure absolute satisfaction.  Due to customer volume the days can sometimes be challenging for the crew, but the effort put forth is what keeps the store in top form and keeps the customers satisfied and coming back in time and time again."

Safeway,1bonncu0fb85efa7,2.0,Benefits are good overall. Weekly paycheck is always awesome.
Safeway,1bonl15tqb89cb97,3.0,"Since merger of Albertsons and safeway the company is not the same, everything seems to be micromanaged from above and frankly a lot of the expectations they ask for are just impossible and everyone knows it."
Safeway,1bongvf0sb89c9hp,3.0,Got let go after my probation period was up . Discriminated but management for a disability i discovered in high school . Unfairly let go for a good paying job .
Safeway,1boneaq32b81iauk,1.0,"I've worked as a Bakery Clerk in Safeway and enjoyed working in the Bakery department. but the way the management is handled there is really unprofessional.

Safeway,1bol7sirtb85cbp0,3.0,It's a great place to work and you meet a lot of great people but management is not supportive and or help full with anything you need. The employees there are great they are the best part of the job. The company is constantly cutting hours and threats of layoff.
Safeway,1bol68vkbb81hfed,1.0,The hours are capricious and constantly shift from week to week with no rhyme or reason. The managers are terrible at keeping up at their job. For all their qualifications they are really just glorified cashiers.
Safeway,1bol30qu4brdabcl,3.0,The managers in the store are generally good people trying to make the store better and help you find a nice department to work in. The people above make them cut hours or do various things that make the store look bad to save a buck or cover themselves when it suits them.
Safeway,1bokvqk3nas1ab0u,5.0,"Safeway is a good company to work for if you want to work.  It is not a company that will sit well with those that want an easy job where they stand around doing nothing.

I learned how to do arrangements and how to decorate plants. management in the store I worked for was okay most of the time. some of the co-workers were not okay at all. they always kept to themselves and seem to pick on some people. I mostly enjoyed working just in the floral department. I had a lot of fun with some co-workers."
Safeway,1boir5q3cb81g8ru,4.0,I thought it was a great job because you could work a lot of overtime. It is a fast paced job and I meat a lot of good people.

Safeway,1bohpnqrfb85a993,4.0,The job in its own was my very first and do thought saying it went amazing and they loved me I've got no beef with Safeway only with the working community but they vary and they are normally okay but can be disrespectedful and that not okay they need to shape up and become better people
Safeway,1bohndci4b81fbi2,5.0,When I first stared i was really excited only because it was my first job ever and i was excited because the accepted me when i had no experience. Working the was great but it came to mind that i was doing so much for this job but it wasn't paying me enough. I wish they could raise the salary because they expect a lot from the workers but only pay them so little. That is not fair at all. I would go back and work if the salary raises.
Safeway,1boghg6qsb895eq0,3.0,I enjoy to work with people daily. I sometimes help people to find the items for the customers. Help the customers to their vehicle. You have to be friendly to the customers daily.
Safeway,1bog3l791b8958s4,1.0,"I was never given a raise when I was promoted. The managers would say that they submitted the paperwork and that there was nothing more to do. The store needs new managers. You constantly have to fix the schedule because they always mess up. The job isn't hard but management sucks. After quitting, I never received my paid vacations or sick hours. Been months already and I am still waiting to get paid."

Safeway,1boc6ncn6b815a2j,3.0,"It's an ok job.  What makes the job worth going for are the people you get to work with.  They help when the job could be stressful or management gets overbearing, they help lift up the atmosphere. They job itself isn't hard, but having to deal with management that really don't have a nack for people, can be difficult."
Safeway,1bobmkag3b895bvp,2.0,"I spent many years working for Safeway and no matter which store I worked at, it was all pretty much the same. The people who worked hard, were the ones who were expected to do the majority of the work, while the people who didn't work hard, were allowed to do as they pleased. The compensation was not fair either. For my skilled position, I made the same as the non skilled positions."
Safeway,1bobjefhfakgt9b3,2.0,Overall if you want to work here for a part time job go ahead at your own risk. This is definitely not the best part time job it is very temporary. I was very happy to leave this when I finally did.
Safeway,1bobgpvvjb895drt,1.0,Don't waste your time with this company. Right now morale all across the board is shot at best. It's so bad the even ops wouldn't come back to work store level.
Safeway,1bobdcvo8akcqapf,4.0,"I went to work at 3:00 A. M., that was a challenge, I learned how to stock merchandise Safeway's way.  The management was great and so was the work culture.  The hardest part was waking up at that time to go to work.."

Safeway,1bob23ljib815afo,4.0,"Working Courtesy Clerk was a decent job, I enjoyed working with the manager who hired me, however the new manager made the job a nightmare. During this job I learned self control and what good customer service. This job was challenging enough to learn something, but easy enough to enjoy it.  The hardest part was the new manager; she had high expectations but did not know how to speak to her staff appropriately and accused without facts.  The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers and talking with the children."

Safeway,1boaluk9hb8549gv,1.0,"As a member of management, the upper management treats you very badly.  They will speak to you in very agressive ways that if you spoke to your employees that way they would repremand you.  The work expectation for management is unreasonable.  If your sales were low you would have to work 6 or 7 days a week and cut non salaried employees so that your store will make labor.  The management team is bullied by the upper management."
Safeway,1boak24sjb854eqj,1.0,"If you enjoy being confuse, from lack of training, and being pressure everyday to know every single detail about the store under a limited amount of time and like having privileged customers downgrading you everyday, well safeway is the job for you.

Hardest part of working at Safeway was people I have a great connections with people which makes me become attached and building relationships then  saying goodbye to this work place was difficult. when you have built a bond with these costumers, staff they become family to me its about  team work and working together which makes life easy."

Safeway,1bo8kh33vbrd387q,4.0,It was fun for awhile. moved up fast but the new store manager was hard to work with. Later was fired for bad management practices. union was useless when i asked for help
Safeway,1bo808pdi5j4p9j8,5.0,Installing new scales and upgrading the stores major technology. I worked as a temp 4 days a week for 10 hour shifts. Changes many registers and also time clocks at each store
Safeway,1bo7t5lkubrd3a4a,4.0,This was my first job and it was great. Loved doing courtesy clerk and was able to advance in hours as much as needed. Great first job and would totally recommend it to people.
Safeway,1bo6omatjb854eem,4.0,Working at Safeway was my first job and there was not much to learn. I would bag food and other things then proceed to push carts. It was good money for being in high school.
Safeway,1bo67r7elas0sdqg,5.0,"it was a greatjob ,at the time i had 5 small children and they were first priority one of my children was ill and required my full attention, so it did not work out. But i have always wanted to get that job back"
Safeway,1bo66vao7b895aue,3.0,Cool place to work and ok pay. A lot of work and room to advance. Everyone there is very helpful and willing to learn. The hardest part is to make sure everything gets done on time.
Safeway,1bo66t7i5as0sdeh,2.0,"Was constantly on the move, only 2 fifteen minute breaks and a half hour lunch SOMETIMES. I'm fine with working hard, and was promoted from stocker to Assistant Manager to Dairy Manager within 6 months, though through it all I got a pay cut. Heard management does it so they make a bigger paycheck."
Safeway,1bo5tc5b8b8159nu,2.0,"manager didn't offer much training or guidance. during lunch time received no help, they have unrealistic productivity goals for employees. Work scheduled wouldn't be organized or posted on time"
Safeway,1bo5om6rab8549ld,3.0,Lack of compassionate management made having any kind of personal life outside of work impossible unless you were a favorite. All of that favoritism lead to a very divided work crew which did not help the workplace culture.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bo5eehbbb895fet,3.0,There's no advancement at Safeway and they even cut hours. No one can survive off this job unless it is a part time pocket money job. It also doesn't offer insurance since people only work 25 hours.
Safeway,1bo5a6695ak4ud30,4.0,"Not a bad place to work, there is potential for advancement if you intend to put in the extra hours and show the desire to work hard. Some coworkers have a touch experience and would say negative things, but that is with any job. I suggest just doing what is required and not getting mixed up in the drama."
Safeway,1bo597usn52subur,2.0,"over worked and underpaid. going through the training process was difficult. when i completed that and actually went downstairs and started working it became easier. unfortunately, the individual that was training me called off one day. i had to fend for myself. i tried my best with the work BUT i did enter some incorrectly. when she returned to the office she YELLED at me in front of all of my co-workers. i will never work their again."
Safeway,1bo4s8ritakgqaa1,5.0,was fun working with happy people. preparing food for sale to customers. cutting deli meats and cheese to customers needs. suggesting alternatives and new product they offer. every day was different. never routine.
Safeway,1bo4e4h37b8158v5,3.0,"Courtesy Clerk position was a good position because it kept you moving and busy constantly. Checking position was very stressful and boring but easy. I learned how to manage stress with lines and customer complaints. Bookkeeping was my favorite position because it gave me the ability to handle unhappy customers, freedom to move around and monitor the front end, and I could work directly with money. Management was very different depending on the person working that day. Some are super helpful and some are not. The workplace culture feels like a second home because all the employees become very close to one another."
Safeway,1bo3t4k211aie0pd,4.0,During opening shift you pull stock off the shelf that has reached expiration.  To ensure quality you take temps of the products that have been left on the wall. Then you fill out the production log to see what needs to be made for the day. As you make product you wash quality shipped fruits and vegetables. After making the products you cool the fruits and vegetables to standard temperature. This job is relatively easy once you pick up pace. The hardest part of the job is cutting warm onions. Management is nice and they have a welcoming work culture.
Safeway,1bo3qok3tak4jbn7,3.0,"Not a great place to work from my experience. Everything is super unprofessional. It completely lacks organization and communication. It was like being at high school again with all the drama. I try to keep to myself and do my job. We were Extremely understaffed, constantly. They also cut me short $0.77 an hour for six months and they will take complete advantage of you if you let them."
Safeway,1bo3lpaigb80qd05,3.0,"Some days were slow, sometimes it was busy. To start, getting carts was the first thing on my list. And bagging groceries. I learned how to work as a team with my other co-workers. The culture was friendly, nurturing, customers were easy to get along with. The hardest part was gathering carts, I loved the people that I worked with. That is what I enjoyed the most."
Safeway,1bo37ahejb84p9vh,3.0,Its an okay place to work if you are a fast learner and dont mind working hard. Stay away from the deli department its the hardest in the store and usually understaffed.
Safeway,1bo370v2dak4jf2b,3.0,"I need full time to support myself and I cannot get it at Safeway. I start between 2 and 3 a.m. everyday that I work. I work in a very cold environment/refrigerated. I learned how to make hourly employee work schedules, administer time appropriately, sanitize and clean the chopping room, etc. The hardest part of my job is the hours. The most enjoyable was the people that I worked with."
Safeway,1bo36m13hb80q99q,5.0,Lots of different opportunities for each individual. Great place. Very friendly. Clean and inviting. Great way to meet new faces everyday. Never a dull moment.
Safeway,1bo3246pjbrcvbjm,2.0,"It was the first job I ever had, but if I could go back and change anything about it I would never have applied. The way I was treated there as a courtesy clerk was far beyond what I would consider an ok work environment. Very little of the staff was grateful for any help I provided and many times others put their workload on me because I was the lowest rung of the latter."
Safeway,1bo2rmvbfb84paoe,2.0,"poor management, lack of communication. not enough hours for employees, poor time management by upper management. disgruntled employees that work at this particular location. a lot of the employees are leaving due to hour shortages and such."

Safeway,1bo1oh56uas0jb28,3.0,The work is hard.  Been there over a year and do not have benefits. Big turn over. People dont want to to work. The people  I work with aregreat. Management has 2 turnovers since ive been there.
Safeway,1bo17p002b88rfgk,3.0,"Poor Management, once new management took over they changed the age limit to 16 and I was not 16 at the time. They did not want to wait until I turned 16"
Safeway,1bo15ipb5b88rao1,3.0,The safeway I work at needs a lot of work. Lots of theft. nothing gets fixed once it breaks. Hours are always back and forth. No one gets fired cause they need people badly.
Safeway,1bo13jqhgb88re17,1.0,Other employees disrespect the younger co-workers. Two managers are rude and talk down you. There is no sense of teamwork. Others don't do their jobs. The managers go back on their word.

I always had a joy of working with flowers and the fact I got to create some of the most beautiful custom arrangements and to see how happy customers were with them, made me feel good. I'd have to say that the hardest part about my job was working with occasionally rude customers but despite that I always carried a smile on my face to the best of my ability. My coworkers were so kind, caring, and overall great people to work with."

Safeway,1bnr1i8rrb88rcut,3.0,"Every day went by the same, check the meat case, grind beef we needed, answer customer questions. My direct manager was ok, however, the store manager was shady and untrustworthy."
Safeway,1bnqm6c9pakcheff,3.0,Safeway is a good company unfortunately I do not know what it is like now due to the fact that they got bought out by Albertsons. Overtime was available . Working and repairing hot ovens was not that much fun.
Safeway,1bnpt3hebbrcvfss,4.0,"Hours vary every week. One week you could be working 35, the next you could be working 15. It all depends on the sales for the store. I personally don't like having a steady amount of hours every week."
Safeway,1bnpp8rkdaqgk81d,3.0,"it was always busy lots of people shopping, in a cash register for most of my shift. It was an easy job just not a lot of hard workers. Management was good at the store."
Safeway,1bnph6ocfb80qcqo,1.0,"Managers failed to explain things they wanted done.

Safeway,1bnp482qjb88r8mm,3.0,"My typical day at work I would go in and stock the deli and frozen areas, and throughout the day I would prepare, wrap, and put out the meat for the meat department. It was hard at night balancing the amount of things that needed to be done because there were customers who needed assistance as I was usually the last one to leave if I was closing. The managers were friendly, if I needed help or asked questions they would answer me or try to help in any way they could. My only real concern was how late they addressed my reason for leaving.  I wish they had handled my situation more respectfully and promptly. All around it was a good job, aside from my few problems, I learned a lot working there."
Safeway,1bnoq0486b88r9iu,4.0,"During my position at Safeway I started off as a Deli Clerk and quickly advanced to Assistant Manager.  During my time as Assistant Manager I was promised a raise and did not get that raise. I however did learn how to stock, count, and order more products for the shelves. I also experienced a lot of good people while working with Safeway co-workers and customers of all different types. It was a great experience."
Safeway,1bnocm13jb80q8d9,3.0,"I originally left for the difficulties with the scheduling, but overall it was an okay job. A typical day as a courtesy clerk involved bagging groceries, getting carts, sweeping, and cleaning the bathroom. It was a pretty decent workplace culture."

Safeway,1bnmvtu62b84lf58,2.0,had it in high school as any normal teen. manager was rude a lot. worked at the flagship store so everything had to be sharp as a tack. probably wouldn't recommend it.
Safeway,1bnmu7e560mtc10f,3.0,"Working at Safeway was tiring. They always wanted you to do extra stuff that wasn't in your job description. Maybe not all Safeway stores are like this, but just the one I worked at and I have to hold managment at the time responsible for that."
Safeway,1bnmbam8fb80n832,4.0,"Safeway is a great first job. Its a great start to work on customer service skills as well as maintain schooling and a career. theres room for advancement to the right employee. The new management has kinda brought alot of people down. it has become more focused on competing with other store locations- If there is a shortcut, the management teams finds it and takes advantage of it."

Safeway,1bnkcp7kcb85jfml,2.0,"The unionized culture of Safeway lead to solid job security, in some cases too solid as employees consistently acted unprofessional on daily basis. It is a college town so I believe a better system of training and development needs to be in place in order to create a more professional and supportive culture helping instill work ethic, pride, and professional mobility. Rather than a very low-level of computer training and unsupportive management that allows an environment of failure to be existent, and is curious as to why young student labor and elderly minimum wage workers do not put effort into showing up on top, establishing clear uniform code, and putting  passion into the product."
Safeway,1bnjpeiee1fdm0bm,5.0,Safeway pharmacy at my location was a great place to work but changes in management were an unpleasant experience.

Safeway,1bnhou0nm5j5aeh5,4.0,Wanted more hours and room to advance but they hired more people and cut my hours. If a company makes you feel worthy and valued your eager to get to work but when they cut your hours to 8-10 a week you don't really want to run there..

Safeway,1bnfp5ij41fdm1b4,3.0,"Had a great time moving from department to department plugging me in when I was needed, managers changed hands and it all went down hill. I tried to get transferred and was unable to do so. Being late too many times did me in, though I did try to relocate stores."

Safeway,1bncmd89rb85j9hb,1.0,If you can't work fast don't bother. This company is totally unrealistic with its expectations. Sadly it's the customers that will choose a different place to shop.
Safeway,1bnc9b3h11fdm7f3,3.0,It wasn't the best job but it certainly wasn't the worst. When the company was taken over by Albertsons it really changed the mood of the company. It pays the bills.
Safeway,1bnc5q08qb81eagj,5.0,Hours are horrible. when i worked there the other employees were very kind and helpful management was outstanding. i just didn't agree with the scheduling.
Safeway,1bnbfoiq1b898e5e,5.0,I did not like the work ethics there everyone was always in a bad mood you couldn't really talk to ur boss about anything goin on because the boss was young and gossiped a lot
Safeway,1bnaa9sb1b81e9e2,2.0,"Unfortunately, being a courtesy clerk at Safeway was not a great job at all. At my particular store, you are treated like garbage, and you are forced to do all of the grunt work nobody else wants to do. I had managers make me do all kinds of jobs that the store manager asked them to do, but they knew they could just ask one of the courtesy clerks to do it for them while they relaxed or did an easier job. Do not work here."

Safeway,1bn9lk7ueakh58m3,1.0,"Management has their favorites. They do not care for their employees.  Pay is terrible, no one is treated with respect. You're asked to do so much with low pay.  Benefits don't begin till you've worked for a year. Hours and scheduling are a joke."
Safeway,1bn9lgfhtb898dvm,5.0,Contract Assignment.  Excellent company to work for.  The work was  challenging and rewarding.  I made a few unsuccessful attempts to secure a full time permanent position.
Safeway,1bn7kiaogak98fbj,4.0,This was the best place to work at one time. Most check stands were open and everybody smiled. College kids worked in the evening and the older people worked during the day.
Safeway,1bn7jlr16b85je55,2.0,It is a place to work. They pay you a low wage for high expectations. No managerial loyalty to long term employees. Unwilling to cooperate with a single mother's daycare needs.
Safeway,1bn7jidrqak98ffo,2.0,"Being loyal, dependable, hard working and still have unrealistic expectations from management. Also, one never knows when your hours will be cut, It's difficult to live on 24hours a week. This is a great place to work for a bored housewife or student."

I dont think the job was hard but ive never cut and weighed meats and cheeses like that"
Safeway,1bn6tp854b85jarl,5.0,"This job was very easy and exciting because it was always a new day and never knew what to expect.

It is a place where you constantly learn new skills and it is never boring. I enjoy working with all of my co-workers and the customers are usually patient and understanding  when we have a rush at lunch or dinner time. It is a great place to work when you have the right attitude and truly care about helping others.
Safeway,1bn54qq4kakd4b2k,3.0,"Overall not a bad place to work, just not very good wages even with experience. Good for students. Good prices on items and fresh product but no money to be made unless you are a meat cutter or upper management."
Safeway,1bn4v2vdsb85jap9,3.0,"If you're looking for employment with great benefits Safeway is the place to work at.  Every position there requires standing your entire shift. some require lifting either mild or strenuous, not recommended if you have a bad back."

Safeway,1bn4pboeib81eb0m,1.0,"I started off as a U.C., moved to Deli Team Member and then moved up to Baker in the bakery. Baker was an enormous strain. Too many things to do for one person alone. Prep for the day, prep for the next day, fry tons of doughnuts by hand and also frost them, make dough 150lbs to 250lbs per day and roll out by hand, bake the bread you rolled out, put toppings on items that need them, some goe through machines, bake off many other goods like muffins, cookies, pies, ect. All while keeping up on the timers, deadlines, orders, and customers and cleaning up and i skipped several other responsibilities but that is more than enough to prove my point. Plus, i never got a raise. I still remained at $10.00 an hour. My story of my experience there continues, but i wont go on about it. All and all, i dont recommend working there unless you are going for Cashier or as a Courtesy Clerk."
Safeway,1bn4nm23db81eeu4,5.0,"I was given the opportunity to excel in different avenues and they were always looking out for me like that. Very positive attitudes and professional management, which was a comfortable experience. Shopping there is fun too!"
Safeway,1bn4ju1p552t8f4d,2.0,"I was there for a week training for a new department, i cut fruit and assisted with all customers needs, and when training was over they said my temp position was over"
Safeway,1bn4fmudrb898flo,4.0,A typical day at work can be fast paced and on your feet a lot.
Safeway,1bn4bsjiabrdafa5,3.0,I really enjoyed working at Safeway. I had a great team and was very well appreciated as a hard working Front End Manager. I would have loved to stay and continue my career there if not for the for the need to relocate unexpectedly.
Safeway,1bn492dhmbrdacs0,2.0,"Small town pharmacy with numerous hospitals in the area, recipe for a busy store. Lack of qualified help and alway training or looking for new  technicians. Most of the work load got pushed upon the pharmacist. Very stressful work environment, I know every store is different, so this is just a snap shot of this particular store."
Safeway,1bn47nfac52t8c70,2.0,I just go to work and do my job or whatever needed then go home .  One of the good things about working at safe way is some of the employees are very easy to get a long with
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bn3tjm3jb85jejp,5.0,"My typical day is never dull. I would say it never be a boring moment at work. As hectic as my work is I enjoy the challenge it brings me and the moment I can achieve it. The minute I have achieve the coverage or resolve the issue, I know that I can move and reach out the next."
Safeway,1bn3sclqeb85jf7n,3.0,"Lived working at Safeway and meeting new customers all the time but also having regular returning customers, met some awesome co workers, and the managers were somewhat flexible"
Safeway,1bn2lvusfb88ueqv,5.0,Working at Safeway is fun and also very productive. At times you're very busy and at times you can be slow. Having to work with people you know is very fun and getting to know the people who have worked there longer is very nice. People are very inviting.
Safeway,1bn2aa06vb88ub9u,3.0,Can be very busy. epically on Fridays. And they are open every holiday. Can be a fun day when you have a good team. I did enjoy me time with this company but with the scheduling was better balanced.
Safeway,1bn2552aqak91c2s,4.0,"I am a FT employee as Produce Manager at a largest sales volume in my District , responsible to delivery Customer Service, Drive sales , meet my goals"

Safeway,1bn1v712rb88u8ho,3.0,"Good benefits, flexible work schedule, opportunity to advance, good pay, don't need a bachelors degree to move around departments. It is a tough and can be stressful."
Safeway,1bn1v5qjtb811evb,4.0,"Good place to work, they have different hours and departments to work in. I have worked there for 33 yrs. It has been a good place to work but it is time for a change."
Safeway,1bn1uh2ftbrcvbtd,3.0,"Along with continuous complaints from entitled customers, the non-union position made it difficult to feel appreciated and satisfied in this work setting.   The co-workers were easy to get along with and I made lifelong friends while I was there."
Safeway,1bn1u6tajb88ueng,3.0,I loved working here until they took advantage of my skill set. the managers were awesome but the store was a low volume which meant that labor had to be low and sometimes we would get busy and be understaffed
Safeway,1bn1tpb3g5nd09su,3.0,"Good company, but no room for advancement. I learn a lot on the job and continuing education that will help me in jobs to come in the future. Just time for something new."
Safeway,1bn1t1thnb856ddl,3.0,"I had a good time working at safeway, especially for my first job because its a little more laid back than the average job. Not a whole lot to stress about which was a good thing."
Safeway,1bn1sbchjb8118p3,4.0,"I would go to work at 4 in the morning. Grab a cart ,long on to the personnel orders and start shopping. Going aisle by aisle shopping for 8 people at once."
Safeway,1bn1j9dsvb88uasn,4.0,"I enjoy this job and my coworkers, but I wish we were able to receive full time easier. It is hard to provide for a family on an inconsistent 20-30 hours a week."
Safeway,1bn1d77c7akguaai,4.0,"An amazing place to work with outstanding employees,and an amazing store manager, the deli is absolutely amazing to work in,as well as working as courtesy clerk up front! Store is also very clean compared to other grocery stores!"
Safeway,1bmvnpcu2b88uecv,4.0,Fast paced an friendly work place.  Had to be open to working week ends and holidays - but holiday pay was great!  Management was easy to work with. Great company Christmas parties!

Safeway,1bmvlsqfub8568qc,2.0,there was always a chance to advance and get more hours in . i liked how you were able to learn new things in different areas of the company . the workplace culture would vary on who is in charge of each department .
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bmveasi052t1bdq,4.0,"Comfortable work place, unorganized, good pay. Lots of drama and very unorganized for a healthy workplace. Looking for a more professional beneficial job with great pay."
Safeway,1bmve4repbrcv9ai,3.0,"i worked here for three years, it was a good experience but nearing the end of my employment there the company started losing its values and mistreating employee's. managers for the most part were good."
Safeway,1bmvcks78brcv8g0,5.0,Working with customers and moving up in the company was a great start when I started working. This company had good management and stability. Only reason I left the job was to pursue an opportunity to work for the State of California.
Safeway,1bmvb4mj15n92bs0,3.0,"A typical day at work for me includes stocking and taking care of the produce department. I learned how items are organized in a typical grocery store system, how inventory is managed, and learned of new food items that I was unsure about. The management and workplace culture is very laid back, perhaps too laid back for me. The hardest part of the job is making sure you know every detail about every item in the store, which can be challenging if you lack experience in a specific department. The most enjoyable part of he job is the free will to choose what task you want to perform at what time, as long as it is within reason and the work is finished at the end of the day."
Safeway,1bmvajahdbrcvf5b,3.0,"Curetsy Clerk position is a base position that requires a lot of standing and basically waiting at all the time. I had learned how to bad, and pack groceries. Management was really nice, and was willing to understand your needs. It is small group of people that work side by side. The hardest part of the job is that you have to be patient, when it is super slow. The most enjoyable part of the job is a pay check lol."
Safeway,1bmv38isfbrcvbv1,4.0,The Albertson merger was a nightmare.  The company no longer cared about their employees and there was no loyalty.  The stores were not given enough hours to meet the company's expectations..
Safeway,1bmv169gqaqgr926,4.0,"Safeway was my first job and I went in fully committed and motivated. Unfortunately, following their merger with Albertsons to gain an advantage in the competitive market, decision making in the upper end has been very inconsistent."
Safeway,1bmuumc8r52t1e77,3.0,didn't really like my hours. Didn't really like how look it took for me to get a raise. Glad i got the experience though. nice staff great food hard workers.
Safeway,1bmurapegak91e7t,5.0,not a very good place to work for the whole year to be honest. horrible management and terrible hours a; though the employees their are really amazing  people to work with

Safeway,1bmtd9h6gaqgra8e,4.0,I liked working at Safeway. it was close to my house and was a reliable job for me to work at. The pay was fair and the work was relatively easy. I would reccomend to a friend
Safeway,1bmshskg1b88ubgr,1.0,All around terrible place to work. No matter what position you apply for be prepared to be a cashier and only a cashier.  You'll be over worked and barely any time off on a regular basis. But every Friday you get paid.
Safeway,1bmse61uhakgu8i2,5.0,Safeway was my first job while I attended high school. They were flexible with the hours I needed and it was an easy job to have during high school. My experience working here was positive.
Safeway,1bmq83nvebrcvcov,3.0,"Customer service, making sure the customer is happy and satisfied with their trip. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new customers and creating friendships with them."
Safeway,1bmpr8bheakgufqd,1.0,"The management at Safeway does not care about their employees well-being whatsoever. I was consistently underpaid, and never allowed a single opportunity for advancement despite being consistently promised opportunities. Management also refused to change my schedule to work around school."
Safeway,1bmpn0gulb856an0,4.0,"My workday... customer service is the name of the game here and I enjoyed every minute of it. This job also can challenge you to be and do, the best you on a daily basis. To me, it doesn't matter where you work, management only wants you to do what you are there for to the best of your ability. Work."
Safeway,1bmphnqn95j55dm3,5.0,Stocking store helping customers find what there looking for n the store. Busy always work to be done. Great teams members and management team. Love stocking

Safeway,1bmoagq4mb856f91,5.0,Its a really fast environment. They are caring but its mostly as in like your job done and no one will ever get involved with what your soing at your job
Safeway,1bmnnnnpeas0vaf2,3.0,"Wouldn't say I hated the job but I didn't necessarily like it. Management in my department never had what we needed. I loved working with the different types of cheese in ""CHEESE WORLD"" I can say i learned a lot about cheese. i also learned no matter how hard you work management stick together."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bmner70naqgrafe,3.0,It's a good place to work at sometime's when you have rude folks in your line. That's when you have to learn to hold your tongue and you have. To learn how to deal with people and you still have to be nice.
Safeway,1bmndulpab811c6p,3.0,Safeway was a great place to gather initial customer service and work experience. The management is helpful and if you communicate any desire to move up they will work with you as long as you show the desire and work ethic.
Safeway,1bmn3pp8rb88u9f9,4.0,"Although I was only employed for a short time, Safeway was a good place to work and the hours were flexible.  Working at the gas station was interesting."
Safeway,1bmmt796vbrcv9sq,4.0,"Good company & benefits. I worked in the Starbucks department but was a Safeway employee, we weren't allowed to except tips. Very busy at times & not always enough coverage. Room for advancement"
Safeway,1bmmnovn7ak52aa3,1.0,CHI is no longer about patients or employees!
Safeway,1bml7pju6b856e54,2.0,"managment doesnt want to spend labor to produce product, therefor dept always looks empty. they have unrealestic expectations for production people. also having two unions in one dept is not a good idea"
Safeway,1bml2bfifas0vcmb,2.0,"It was stressful everyday at the job. Very dirty in the back of the store, behind the store where the pallets were dropped off and in the bathrooms. Rat infested"
Safeway,1bml11ftkbrcvb41,5.0,I worked in the deli and the bakery for many many years. It was fast paced and stressful at times but a great place to work. I learned how to do most of the positions in each department. I know it was a job but I had many fun and happy memories. I loved our huddles that boosted morale and was just fun.There will always be some difficult customers but overall I loved serving the customers.
Safeway,1bmkrm1p9b88ue8i,3.0,Safeway has been a great company to me in the past. I have been there for 12 years. I have received a number of promotions and I have been recognized for being a prime employee.
Safeway,1bmklmcia52t1ec3,3.0,Learned a lot about multiple aspects of the job from this company and was given plenty of freedom to manage my area as needed though was never given the tools or help to do so.
Safeway,1bmkk4i4fb811dk7,1.0,Working at Safeway was a mix of negative emotions for me because if I needed help learning how to do something I would get completely ignored. As well as the fact that I was only paid $9.50 an hour
Safeway,1bmkcrcdeas0vfk1,5.0,"I enjoyed working there the manager was a wonderful man sincere and helpful . I was a cashier, but I also worked in the deli. The store has since closed"
Safeway,1bmj39ojlakgtccf,5.0,"Union position. Great opportunity to move up.I had a great boss who taught me a lot. This job was fun and helped me to see my creative side. Overall, great job!"
Safeway,1bmivqiklak51e1k,3.0,"I have learned a lot from working  here . i have learned how to deal with more people at once, became a very social person. The hard part about being there was the management was not at its best. We were very low on staff and our front end managers would no call no show. It was good that it fit around my school schedule and was a weekly pay."
Safeway,1bmituve3b80uf0l,1.0,Bad management. No available advancement opportunities. Incredibly unprofessional employees and management all around. The union protects the worst employees from ever getting in trouble for bad and lazy work.
Safeway,1bminrq93b80u9hk,5.0,"My experience has included opening/closing of store, visual merchandising, receiving shipments, counting inventory and ordering weekly foods and supplies. I assist the store manager in implementing store operations and monitoring cost performance ensuring cost does not exceed the authorized funding. I also train staff, deploy coworkers and delegate tasks so that we can maintain a clean, safe and positive environment."
Safeway,1bmigiscs5j50a29,5.0,first job out of college. worked on printing equipment that would lead to other jobs in the future. Great company to work for at the time. Grew many skill sets while there.
Safeway,1bmie6p7bb853aqm,5.0,you get the option to be a part of ufcw union
Safeway,1bmic7547b853ej3,3.0,"The management there wasn't the best. They would rather hire new people instead of giving you more hours. The coworkers were friendly, but management was very rude and uptight."
Safeway,1bmibdefsb88rdj4,4.0,Safe way was a good job very productive the menegers where very nice and supportive the job was easy to catch on and learn I also like that the work invierment was very calm and relaxing to work with

Safeway,1bmi1jgceb80ue8b,5.0,"I had a lot of fun made some friends while i was there. it was fast paced, there was a lot to do i was never bored, there was a lot of nice people. management was excellent."
Safeway,1bmi17hjk5ncvb2l,5.0,very simple work place with a very simple pace gives you great opprotunities to work on your customer service skills with others and also has great beneifits along with the job
Safeway,1bmi12177b80ua6k,3.0,The hours that my manager would give me were bad and i didnt get a lot. also working in the Union sucked because half of my paycheck went to paying to be in the Union.
Safeway,1bmhr28pp5n91edo,3.0,"I learned a lot about working in a fast pace environment here. It was always an interesting experience. However, as a cashier, I did not have a clear-cut manager so this was more of a group effort. Additionally, I was only supposed to be working part time but averaged out at full time hours by the time I quit."
Safeway,1bmgq3trgb88rejp,3.0,"Warehouse money and benefits are at the top of the industryear however it's extremely easy work made stressful by unrealistic expectations and a union so crippled by corruptions, it's ineffective"
Safeway,1bmgk29gpak8uc9j,4.0,"Safeway did not give employees 40hrs to avoid from giving them medical insurance which was a downer. At times i would only get 11hours per week , and if i got anything more than 30 hrs it required arriving for a 3am shift."
Safeway,1bmg83tk7ak508pr,1.0,"Hard working , with no help stressful and lack of communication, most of the time managers do not know how to do their job and they go to employees to do it and help out"
Safeway,1bmg2vt4jb80ubmp,2.0,"No one to take charge, long time techs did what they pleased. Floating pharmacist did not enjoy working there and most of the time things would not get done."
Safeway,1bmg2rs3852t0e3q,3.0,the store manager wanted me to fry donuts so with his encouragement I learned a new job. about a year later I became a baker. my best days were holidays lots of product made lead baker and I pulled it off together
Safeway,1bmg1i9rcak8uaj9,3.0,Don't get me wrong safeway is a good company to work for. But they should listen to there employees more. That way they would have better under standing what goes with there customers on these home deliveries.
Safeway,1bmfm7htab88raqc,3.0,"When I quit I was told that for a manager to be my reference they would need to go through hr and it would be a big ordeal, but it was my last day, so I just left."
Safeway,1bmfk23nfb80uam2,5.0,"Every day brought somthing new to the table, things i'd never seen before. But most were..eventful. If theres one thing that i've learned from working here is that be patient, do what your told and itll keep a good flow."
Safeway,1bmfjrtkeak50d93,4.0,"As someone who entered the work force for the first time at Safeway, I will say that the benefits and pay were not too bad and there were chances to move up in the company. At times, management was not entirely willing to work with my schedule, but it was rare that there were any big issues. Generally, my coworkers were respectful and positive and it was a good experience. Sometimes the work can be physically demanding/unpleasant depending on the department. Overall not a bad place to work."
Safeway,1bmfhmbsbb80udnj,2.0,"A typical day is stressful, your opinion isn't valued. They don't encourage advancement in the company either. I have learned how to work hard, and get things done without the help of others (Teamwork isn't something this company works on either). If you work hard you aren't rewarded. If you don't work hard you aren't punished either. So basically the hard workers are always picking up slack and never rewarded. The management is fine, that's not to say that there isn't room for improvement (there defiantly is). The hardest part of the job is not being respected, and not being shown reward for your hard work. And if  you want to advance in the company, its very hard to because they don't recognize hard workers."
Safeway,1bmfepa6f5ncv8o5,5.0,great place to work with a fast paced environment. not enough people are applying for employment at these facilities so alot of work needs to be done for a skeleton crew on a daily basis.
Safeway,1bmf77rhqakcrff0,4.0,The health benefits are outstanding in my opinion.  The management in certain departments can be lacking and sometimes the morale also leaves a lot to be desired.
Safeway,1bmf6qr3b5j50ak8,3.0,Not the best place to work. A very stressful place to work and management is very poor. They allow minorities to obtain positions but make minorities go through he'll to keep the position. Many managers in major areas show prejudice behavior.
Safeway,1bmedvd0mb80ucnp,5.0,Work with awesome people but management plays favorites. Great place to advance but very tiring. I love helping with price changes. Cashiering is very tiring
Safeway,1bmebm8buakcrc28,5.0,"great workers,Yes the work is beyond hard, but atleast they pay us well. The best thing about Safeway is the people, I've made tons of friends here over the years. I also help everyone here with their Real Estate needs� yup! REALTOR, and Fork Lift driver. I do it all. Facebook me, if you want to be friends.."
Safeway,1bme270dub80ndu6,3.0,Wouldn't call it the best place to work but you'll definitely earn your experience in the work force here. Alot of smiling employees. Happy customers.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bmdrdji7ak4rblo,2.0,Great company to start working for. Many opportunities to grow and continue learning new experiences. Great employees to work with and fun environment.
Safeway,1bmcs4v6rbrcl808,2.0,They schedule minimal hours and EXPECT you to correlate your life around your job. They schedule minimal hours with expectation of you staying to commit to the jobs needs.
Safeway,1bmcn89qhb84sekk,5.0,"Working as a barista was fun and exciting. Having to push sales on new product gave me more interaction with customers throughout the store. I learned many new skills, from making drinks to handling customers who were highly upset that their drink was made incorrectly. Management seems to care more about their days off then giving days off to those who asked for it. If you would ask for a day off then you would find that your schedule for the next week was cut to short and you lost hours. I enjoyed working their only because of the constant change in people and the safeway employees and manager staff."
Safeway,1bmcevnhpb88lcov,3.0,"My immediate supervisor (at Starbucks, Yakima) lacked many ""management"" skills which usually made for a difficult work environment for myself and my coworkers."
Safeway,1bmbl1rhfaqgmb8t,3.0,This job was sketchy as heck.  I had to be sent to the E.R because there has a heroin needle in the trash can. Would not recommend working at that place .
Safeway,1bmbhaj5pb84sb97,3.0,"The overall work requirements are easy to learn. The drinks are easy to learn, the customers more often than not a pretty chill and relaxed with exceptions of course. Being trained in the routines and recipes is never an issue considering that Starbucks outlines and has a standard for nearly every little thing that goes on in all store operations. Unfotunately, due to the fact that the location is a licensed store you often have to defer to store managers who are not familiar with starbucks store operations, schedules are unpredictable, you are often pressured to work on your own during busy store hours, understaffing has always been an ongoing issue and hour cuts are frequent. It's a good place to work if your looking for benefits as it is linked to the union and the work environment with other people besides management is overall good."
Safeway,1bmbgiu1g5n8qekf,3.0,"Poor management, the employees were good people , good environment but just poor lazy management. The hardest part of the job was dealing with managers giving me 3 hour shifts."
Safeway,1bmbghnhhb88lemi,5.0,I worked for starbucks in Safeway. I enjoyed it and had fun working in the grocery store environment. I also enjoyed seeing daily shoppers get their drinks they always get.
Safeway,1bmbfqpajb88ld23,2.0,At first I thought it was going to be an enjoyable experience  but on my first night I was told I wasn't allowed to clock off when my shift ended because my coworkers left me alone which was against policy.  They have major favoritism issues here and the management tried to make up their own rules to get what they wanted when they wanted.  They took me off the schedule for 3 weeks . During those 3 weeks I was checking in daily to see if I was working and then after the 3 weeks the store manager let me know she heard a rumor and had to let me go.
Safeway,1bm8h8k1n5j4rajm,2.0,I worked Night Crew and my fellow employees and our management team always never saw eye-to-eye. So I was unhappy for 6 years. I replenished shelves and rotated product.
Safeway,1bm8h7898b80nech,2.0,"They do not have hand scanners have to lift to scan or type in numbers, management has favorites, and assistant management drags their feet when I or anyone needs overrides or help on register. They need to empower us with more so we don't have to keep the customers waiting. Hardest part of job is lifting all to scan."
Safeway,1bm88s07jas0pbae,4.0,"My time spent at Vons, was a very memorable time indeed. The job itself was very fast paced, which really made the time fly by. I could not have asked for better co-workers. I believe it is the phenomenal people that work there, that truly made it an experience worth having."
Safeway,1bm7lsshjb84sfas,4.0,"This place was fast paced, No nonsense, but also a fun place to work .The management team is very fair and and willing to help you out in a crisis, (work related or not). I've learned (in my last 14 years with them) how to think fast, multi task, and find my way out of a jam. I really enjoyed my time there and hope to find employment with a company that has the same feel"
Safeway,1bm7goa3ub84s8bo,2.0,"co-workers are wonderful i love the work i do, but our store manager is a controlling bully who has not only yelled at me on the work floor with customers around but all employees in our store.  he talks down to everyone and has created a very stressful environment.  we've only had this manger about a month and our store has crashed with him there, our old manager had the store and employees in great shape we were like one big close knit family that all worked together.  theres a separation now from the negative manager."
Safeway,1bm6q6tinb88l9n2,3.0,Alright place to work. Compensation is every week which is good. the courtesy clerk job was more than what it is said. closing sucks!
Safeway,1bm5r97ggbrclenq,5.0,Management was great and treated everyone equally. The people I worked with made twice the money that I did and I was always doing twice the work because of some old union contract and new union contract. Other than that it was an enjoyable workplace.
Safeway,1bm5mgbh1b88lesa,4.0,"What I did most of the day was bag groceries, retrieve shopping carts, restock shelves, clean areas that got dirty such as spills, build up, and spot cleaning. I learned the ins and outs of grocery retail. Management has a strong presence, mainly because the workers were young, and inexperienced. Management worked just as hard as the employees. My co-workers were just as busy as me most of the time. The hardest part of my job would be walking across the huge store to do something urgent, so I did a lot of power walking. My favorite part of the job was the dairy freezer. In Arizona it was hot, so the cold isles, and freezer were always refreshing."
Safeway,1bm5i21vvakcn9u8,3.0,A typical day is very fast paced and challenging at times. The opportunity for advancement is there waiting for the right person. The jobs in management are stressful most of the times.
Safeway,1bm5btauob80n8na,3.0,Well i give it a bad review because the Safeway i was worked at was in Berkeley and they were so unorganized they didn't treat it like it was a place of business.

Safeway,1bm3vum69b88la2o,3.0,"The overall job was not that bad. I was not a fan of management and they way that the handled certain situations. For example, I was told that in order to get a promotion I had to work night crew but people that started work the same time I did, did not have to do this. I also did not enjoy all the theft that happened and the fact that the company did nothing. It created a feeling of an extremely unsafe work environment which was the reason I left. The customers were also extremely rude but they were seeing all the theft that was happening so I understand why. Overall this was not a great job and I am glad to be no longer employed with this company."

They would tell me I wore to much makeup and not to wear a lot and my co workers would try also getting me in trouble. It was a okay job it took me at least 2 or 3 months to remember the drinks. I only had the closing shifts because my boss played favoritism. In the end i got hurt on the job and the people there didn't care even though I had a doctors note they kept telling me to come in.
Safeway,1bm0ikrgsaqgjfi3,5.0,"i love working at safeway.  i did not mind being part of a union.  everybody including the store manager and assistant store manager knew when everybody needed to take their schedule break, lunch break.  upper management does their best to try and ask if you can stay longer or come in earlier and when they ask it is always in a nice and polite way, and if you ask who or what they will gladly and politely give you  an answer"
Safeway,1bm0evgpq1d056ck,3.0,Personally I had not too many issues with this employer because I mostly ran my own department and excelled at my position. The management could use a look into though as I'm sure better qualified people are waiting in the wings for a deserved opportunity.

Safeway,1blbctbtub875brq,2.0,"Fast paced, compensation has been very fair, ability to move up quickly if you have common sense and are good wth people.  It can be a difficult environment as you are working with the public and under a generally unrealistic timeline.  If you are a manager you will never go home having completed your job at the end of the day so there can be very little satisfaction in that regard.  You always feel inadequate at best and a complete failure at times.  Best part of the job is that you have the ability to help others achieve goals and get to a point in their lives they can achieve financial security and accomplish more than perhaps they thought was possible."

I've learned that each culture is represented by a fruit or vegetable. Management, an excellent team that understands and works with the workers. The mix of people that work here are all represented by their own cultures and offers a better understanding of bringing people together. the hardest part of a this job, is it demands a physical part of you. Meeting the customers needs makes a challenge but also allows you to understand the need for the lives to stay normal. The most enjoyable part, would be to meet different people of all walks of life. It offers a place where you can relax shopping and seek new meets."
Safeway,1bl0p3dmoas1jdse,4.0,Managers will work a 10 - 12 hour day. Two days off but will often spend some off time dealing with work issues or getting caught up. Manage approx. 120 employees. Customer Service is a big part of your entire day. Expectation is to be on sales floor 80% of your day. Constant redirection from upper management can be very stressful. Management goals are to develop employees for advancement and when you can find time to do this it can be a very rewarding experience for both manager and employee.
Safeway,1bl0jc6jvb87594b,4.0,Working within DOT.COM they had a really bad scheduling issue. Often worked 14 hour days with no lunch or breaks. Often found myself living there instead of home.
Safeway,1bkvqcdgs1d176gh,5.0,"Only hard part is the heat, otherwise it is an great job and easy to learn. You can do it! Yes you can! you can do it! try if you can! I don't know what else to say."
Safeway,1bkvjpq685n93ckd,1.0,"I like workin the Bakery. It's a stressful environment. Ppl talking bout ppl. Manger's show favoritism. We make minimum wage. Part timers only get 4 hours a day, to do 12 hour work in. Shaking my head. Manger's telling employees business and it's jus a crazy work environment"
Safeway,1bkvcr9na1d174la,4.0,"a typical day at work for me consists of rotating and stocking milk, eggs, and perishable dairy products, temping coolers, and writing safety observations. I've learned the importance of date checking items as well as rotating them and what items sell in what quantities when. I feel as though managers are managers and just that, never being personable with their employees and breathing down your neck more often than not. In the workplace you're always dealing with people, greeting them with smiles and asking if you can help them with anything, you always have to provide 1st class customer service. The hardest part of the job is being expected to get EVERYTHING done without help in a department that needs 2 people to work it. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is working around the other employees in the store."
Safeway,1bkvcd5441fdj7iv,2.0,"I worked here for 14 years but after that time it was time to go. I did not see me moving up or out to a better position so I needed a change. I worked in the deli most of the time I did work at Safeway and you can get burnt out very quick. It is a fast paced job and a stressful job if things don't run smooth which all boils down to the crew and most importantly the supervisor for that dept. I did enjoy it at some times but people change and come and go and at the time of me leaving it was my time to go. I am looking to move up with a company not just stay in one spot for all the years I am there, they say they are a promote from within company but it is not true for some. If they need you in the dept. you are in then that is where you stay. The benefits are the best part of this job. Medical is great as well as dental and vision. I will miss the benefits but sometimes you have to make sacrifices for a change."
Safeway,1bkutudgk1fdj1oa,4.0,"Even as a contractor, I experienced good teamwork in resolving technical issues."
Safeway,1bkumtarg1fdj4ed,3.0,Working here to get through it you just have to keep to your self and don't listen to what other workers have to say . Supervisors are ok to work with union is good
Safeway,1bkug3qprb875dpq,3.0,"Entire HR staff was given lay-off notice, but then asked to re-apply for our current positions. We were all replaced by people from the corporate office, but then I was offered the same position in a different state. Didn't make much sense."
Safeway,1bkuckjc4b8758vj,5.0,"My years at Safeway were some of my brightest. I started as a checker and was given every opportunity to grow within the different departments. Management rollover was high, but each one found and nurtured different skills I excelled at. I'm grateful for every moment I worked there."
Safeway,1bku708bhaqhsf6e,2.0,Underpaid and not enough working hours. Very busy and crowded. Very little advancement. Poor management. I do not recommend working for this company.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Safeway,1bku6m45l5nd39sc,3.0,could be better its management however that sometimes makes this job difficult.  I wish I could make an impact within my job but being around older and more seasoned guys its not this best place for me.
Safeway,1bkt79g921d0a7gm,4.0,"Good times, worked for a year and half. Started as a courtesy clerk and moved to cashier. It was a little difficult to manage school/work, not very flexible hours. Management barely showed appreciation."
Safeway,1bkt6dq471d0a609,5.0,The workplace would be more workable if management is better.  Not he best place to work if you're in the pharmacy. The pharmacist can get over stress and take it out on their coworkers.
Safeway,1bkt622hg1d124sj,3.0,"Working at a grocery store is one of those jobs you do to gain retail experience. The typical work day isn't difficult. For most, it's either bagging groceries or standing at a checkstand for 8 hours. You learn about the ins and outs of the business. Made me a better shopper for one thing. Helped me look for sales and get info from other parts of the price tag you'd normally never look at. Management depends on the store. Sometimes you get good managers who are willing to work with you and help you. Other times, you get managers that don't care and just want to get paid and go home. I've been somewhat fortunate to have good managers of the most part. They like to promote from within. A promotion typically means a department change or to Front End Supervisor. No significant pay raise to go from Checker to Supervisor. Raises are given by how many hours you work. For example, working 1,000 hours is roughly a .20-.30 cent raise. Front End typically tops out at $5 more than an outside department. Again, it's your typical ""get into the working world"" or ""get work experience"" job."
Safeway,1bkseubqhb8b6dnm,2.0,I was a Florist when the new store on Sunset opened. They hired hundreds of people to help get the store running and I was one of the hundred or so who got laid off when they realized they hired too many people.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bksc7oemb8b2fia,2.0,From working at Safeway I endured a great deal of bullying and a lot of unprofessional behavior. I reported a problem that was promised to be taken care of and it wasn't.
Safeway,1bks7rbqgas1fcns,2.0,A typical day at work is long standing and short breaks (15 min) if working less the 6hrs. I learned a lot about retail by this being my first time.  A lot of standing and people's attitudes when services is poor because of management and scheduling.  Not enough cashiers because of cut back on schedule.  There are no problems with the culture of and the hardest part is long standing.  The most enjoyable is meeting the people most are very friendly and appreciate what I do.
Safeway,1bks5uqjtb8b2amc,5.0,A great friendly place to work. As long as you enjoy serving smiling and having fun. This place would be great for you. High paced environment. Loved working there.
Safeway,1bkrbf0knak60bo9,4.0,"Healthcare jobs are stressful. Overall St. Vincent is a good place to work. Just need better people in management that are willing to stay and care about the workers. Also, management stop trying to cut benefits."
Safeway,1bkq8d2a5akhjbde,5.0,i liked a people and how they value they workers.. they had good benefits however i wasnt there long enough to use any but i liked work there.........
Safeway,1bkq671upakhjdpl,5.0,It was definitely an interesting experience while I was in high school.
Safeway,1bkq66s5mb86e9k1,1.0,Hated working there. Management was terrible. Employees did whatever they wanted. A lot of favoritism. Some got away with things that others would get fired for.
Safeway,1bkq4kt62brdd82f,2.0,"Before Albertsons took over I would have given Safeway a better rating.  Now, nothing but stress (unless you are a bagger).  No help so you work twice as hard as you should. Decent insurance.  Not as good as it used to be.  I wouldn't recommend this company to an enemy! (Well, maybe an enemy!)"
Safeway,1bkpuu4d9b8amao6,4.0,"the job was simple as a courtesy clerk, which basically meant i had janitorial duties and bagging. after that i became a checker which was ok, part of me missed walking around but the hours were better. overall consensus I enjoyed it."
Safeway,1bkptr48fbrddasj,4.0,"a typical day at work would be fast-paced with 1-2 breaks. Lunch could be optional. There's always something to do. Management is tolerable, they know what they're doing. Couple hiccups here and there. Hardest part of the job would be the time-management or heavy lifting. Best part is that the other employees are sociable and you can easily communicate with them to get the job done. Once you're out of high school it becomes a serious occupation, the grocery business doesn't mess around."
Safeway,1bkpkkn62brdde1v,4.0,I had no work life balance as a direct result of working in the night crew meaning that in order to maintain my sleep schedule for adequate performance I needed to sleep during everyone else's waking hours meaning I couldn't really socialize.
Safeway,1bkpk4b9vb86ee0n,2.0,"Grocery stores are great for starter jobs. But I took on more responsibility without ever seeing the pay. 3 job titles i held, at one point. Even worked the deli with promise to get payed a dollar more an hour...the new guy got what I was told I was going to make."
Safeway,1bkpji4qf0mt638c,2.0,"I work here as a school job do not remember anything most of the time I would just sweep and mop the floors filler filler filler filler filler filler,"
Safeway,1bkph9b2c5ncqerp,2.0,"Always worked long hours, because i wanted to advance. When you finally advance there are longer hours. They want you to do the work of three people, and never give enough hours to departments."
Safeway,1bkpg17g7ak9ic2i,2.0,"I handled all of the ordering and marketing for the floral department at this particular store.  I also did floral design for customers upon request and filled the coolers with ready-to-go bouquets daily.  My manager was a tool, to put it mildly, and had it not been for him I would've stayed there longer."
Safeway,1bkpcsma0b83k92o,3.0,"It enjoyed working for Safeway, but I worked a lot and hard but just was underpaid for that little money they want to pay. I wouldn't go back not inless they paid a nice salary."
Safeway,1bkp9sgohb83kc1t,5.0,The customers were great and I enjoyed working with them.  I am a people oriented person who actually enjoys engaging with others.  I enjoy helping people.

Safeway,1bkoi0ad8b86efqn,4.0,"A typical day at work will consist of cart-pushing, grocery-bagging, garbage-tossing, and helping customers. I learned that work can be rewarding not based on how hard you work, but who you know, management can be your best friend, or a nightmare."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bkn163tgb8amdu4,4.0,change in open door policy is needed. raises are needed for entry level employees and cashiers. Garnishment plans can be changed a bit. Changes to higher benefits could be changed with some of the back breaking work. insurance deductibles and comprehensive could be lowered as they seem a little on the steep side. it would be better to be able to pay out of check.
Safeway,1bkmngt47b8am8kc,4.0,Safeway management can be very flexible to work with your schedule. Unfortunately schedules are only posted weekly and if you don't have high seniority you can work all different hours  throughout a week. The staff is very nice and all together a fun work environment.
Safeway,1bkmjfj8sb83ka17,5.0,Safeway was a fun place to work at. I loved the work environment. My co workers were fun and enjoyable to work with. My managers were cool and understanding.
Safeway,1bkmip4ctas0sf8u,1.0,The safe way manager there was boring and didnt do alot to help the store progress in to any thing greater that backed up cash registers and angry customers.

Safeway,1bkl3ck3pb86ebjl,4.0,I worked in multiple areas of the store so there was a lot to learn and I loved that. I worked in the deli doing production 2 am shifts making all the cold and hot prepped food for Safeway's grab and go cases. I was in charge of temps for the store and calculating our wastes every morning. I also worked in our produce's new department the fresh cut room. Here I'd package fruits and veggies as well and cutting and preparing them.
Safeway,1bkku6h720kbo3q8,4.0,Like any retail job it can be very stressful. The job is a great beginner job and you can advance quickly if you want to stay in the grocery Industry.
Safeway,1bkkgbc7kb8amdfk,5.0,"Busy, stressful."
Safeway,1bkkfkjvob86ee3g,3.0,"As a whole its hard for me to recommend this job because of what i experienced in working for Safeway in the 11 years that i did. The management team i had at the store i worked at had a very bad mentality toward its employees. I witnessed and experienced a lot of favoritism and retaliation throughout the store. Our store had all the potential to be a great store, and a great place to work at, but because of management, and their treatment of their employees, it was hard for many people to show up and put in their best effort and enjoy coming to work everyday. Hard work and experience was constantly looked down upon as absurd as that sounds, while mediocre work and laziness was rewarded. The store i worked at was ran upside down, and as unproductive as possible. Because i worked at only one store, i cannot compare it to any other store, or experience."
Safeway,1bkk8mbt5b83kc8p,4.0,"It was a decent workplace. I'm neutral about it, not much to say about it. Sometimes staff could be rude, other times friendly. Customers could be extremely rude at times."
Safeway,1bkk3u59gakdgbmb,5.0,The only thing I didn't appreciate was I worked 8 days straight with one day off then another 8 days. And I did a 5 person job. I wasn't able to explore out of the departments. Management had favorites.
Safeway,1bkjr4r4o0mtr4vh,4.0,I was a rehire great start for me and I will recommend others as well to work with Safeway it was a  learning experience I was able to be a successful with working as a team and being promoted to verious positions

Safeway,1bkhkfkn40mcj77o,2.0,"Being a courtesy clerk, you had to do pretty much everything for minumum wage. Doing the shopping carts was the worst part of the job since you had to do it outside in the heat. The managers are meh to say the least. Overall, not the greatest place to be working at."
Safeway,1bkhh2qpib83kc20,3.0,"i would still be working there today, the different weekly schedules threw my life off balance, i'm ready for a regular mon-fri set hours kind of job."

Safeway,1bkg0bktnakhjae6,1.0,didn't like management. They mocked me when I had to quit to go back to college. They ran the store in a very average way. Can i be done with this yet?
Safeway,1bkfkkqedbrddev7,5.0,Every day was a different challenge as the customers needs varied from day to day. Organizing tasks on a daily bases to meet the needs and demands for that particular day was satisfyingly a challenge. Getting to know some of the regular customers and being able to meet their needs and seeing the satisfaction on their faces made even the most chaotic of days great.
Safeway,1bkfetdrkas0sd6t,2.0,Safeway doesnt see their employees as people you are nothing more than mindless slaves to them. They dont train you properly  not even close to it infact.  Will even stick you in a department your not trained for. the lower on the store staff ranking level you are  at the more you get blamed when something goes wrong in the store even if you didnt do it.
Safeway,1bkfchqj4akdgc3c,5.0,Moved up the ladder fast. Only left because I needed more income at the time . Nice company care about the community and the people that work for them .

Safeway,1bkettsupak5mf05,5.0,"Busy days always moving always have to be ""on"" handling many customer service needs. Communicating. Having confidace in handling people from all over.

I'm very good with handling people."

Safeway,1bkdo49bd0mcj7o8,3.0,Safeway doesn't really like to pay for the work that they want done. They write you up for staying later to complete you work and they write you up if its not completed. I like that Safeway taught me how to be able to prepare food for the customers as well as safety rules and health procedures. There is no room for growth in this business.
Safeway,1bkd878omb8ah9n9,1.0,"Minimum wage, no advancement, work schedule is posted 2 days in advance for the next week. Management is toxic."

Safeway,1bkcie7090mtr4d5,3.0,I didn't like working at my particular Safeway . Everything was unorganized. On top of that we had a new manager every month. There was issues with payroll and things of that nature. it was a bad experience for me.
Safeway,1bkcern83brdd9c2,3.0,Hardest part of the job is the constant changing of leadership to be able to maintain profits in the grocery industry. Depending on area clientele is not always the friendliest.

Safeway,1bka87nefb86b84p,5.0,This company gave me the majority of my retail experience I moved up very quickly and received excellent management training. This company wants their employees to succeed and gives opportunity to anyone who desires it.
Safeway,1bka7q6vcb8ab8n9,5.0,"It is a back-breaking, manual labor job. It is not an easy place to work by any means. There are days with mandatory overtime. You can end up working 11 hour days and not know that that's going to be the case until an hour before you're scheduled to be off. That being said, you are compensated very well with the pay and benefits for your hard work. (Another bonus is the overtime. Any more than 40 hours is overtime. However, if you work only one day, but work 10 hours in that day, you get two hours of overtime pay.)"
Safeway,1bka5ps74b83ddo1,4.0,"I had a great team in the Deli department but the store manager had a bone to pick with the department always, no matter how good things were going, or how nice the department was kept. He would go off on us if we didn't recieve enough product even when it was out of our control. There was also some serious sexism issues in the store I worked for."
Safeway,1bka19ujfbrd78dv,2.0,"I've met some of my greatest life-long friends through working at Safeway. However, management does not respect their employees and does not give room for advancement.

Safeway,1bka0h472akdccpf,3.0,"Friendly work environment but there is a lack of capable management and the workers have to pick up the managements slack. Safe and clean work space, and there is room for advancement."

Safeway,1bk7p6a6ab865cgf,1.0,Good pay.  Cut throat management and minions trying to move up the company ladder but stay right where they are at because management doesn't care about them.  Overall bad company to work for now unfortunately.  Safeway PIC used to be a good company to work for but not anymore.
Safeway,1bk7oedebb8abcbh,2.0,Starting off it seemed very nice at first but took bad turn soon after. Some of the managers I've encountered had very poor treatment to employees and myself.
Safeway,1bk64l3smb83da1r,4.0,Some days challenging some days rewarding. Hard company to work for like you own it as requested. No connect between employees and managment. High employee turnonver makes it hard to create a strong managable team.

Safeway,1bk5t2bbqas0j8a6,4.0,"I have realy enjoyed my time in the deli. If it's not something you enjoy, it's not where you should be. Fellow employees who don't want to be there only make the job more difficult. It's quick and chaotic at times but you get to interact personally with customers. You get a lot of regulars that you get to know and it's a friendly atmosphere for the most part."
Safeway,1bk5d91efb8a7dlg,4.0,"This job was good experience for me in terms of learning how to interact with customers and provide quality service to shoppers.

Safeway,1bju4k596ak5efoi,2.0,The pay is close to minimum wage starting out. There is not much room for advancement. Advancement opportunities tend to come to favorites. Jobs are not very secure since the company has a problem with keeping stores productive.
Safeway,1bju4fh00ak5e9tq,2.0,"Working at Safeway was the worst seven years of my working experience. The bakery was mismanaged. The people who were promoted were ""yes men"" and oft-times under qualified. The management took credit for all ideas from the hourly workers. Overall, this job was a disaster."
Safeway,1bjthgoo6akh9c7s,4.0,Management and people were fun to work with. Work was balanced and pretty straightforward and not too demanding. Pay was good and hours were good. Was a great first job and was not upset working there.

Safeway,1bjsq7d74b8a7bbu,3.0,"Felt like basic entry level work. Wasn't something I was particularly interested in doing, and management didn't make up for lack of enthusiasm. Poor higher ups led to many problems around the work place. However, the environment and coworkers were all very nice and fun to be around."
Safeway,1bjsol6m75nd08j7,1.0,"You are expected to do everything, without a break or lunch, and get treated like garbage.  Because of the lack of help, you're constantly flying, trying to get the work done, and risk making a mistake.  Their mentality is shocking.  Wish there was a union."
Safeway,1bjrvct46b85v8jn,3.0,"Typically bagged groceries daily, gathered carts, swept & cleaned store and helped other employees while greeting customers. Learned how grocery stores are organized. Management is mediocre at times. Hardest part of the job is gathering carts during busy hours and standing for long periods of times. Most enjoyable part of the job is lunch time where you have a great selection of foods to eat."
Safeway,1bjrgedl7b85veer,4.0,Nice staff and management. They had snacks in the break room and got me out on time most of the time. Wouldn't get annoyed if I asked for time off and were always really sweet when I came in on my days off.
Safeway,1bjrf14foak97cp4,1.0,"The management is very bad, pay is minimum wages, no extra hours, favortizema to certain employes, new employees get crispy hours, treat you like slaves. Don't work there not worth it."
Safeway,1bjrcdq9hakd8bvh,4.0,good place to work. great benefits. made everything from scratch back then. hardest part of job was washing the large mixers between batches of breads or cookies or cake batter. customer service was a priority here. you would leave your area to show a customer where a product was if asked. I earned most of my baking process here at this store.
Safeway,1bjr3ipe8b8a78ju,4.0,"It was a good job, nice to work at while in school. Every day was fun at work, felt like coming to a place where family are all the time. The manager was okay. The assistant manager was the down fall of the company"

Safeway,1bjr0v4ttb8a7bvl,4.0,Making sure all my customers leave the store happy. I would like to get more hours working there but they don't have any to give. I'm looking for a more set schedule and full-time job status.
Safeway,1bjqjrbo6b8a79q6,3.0,My overall experience with safeway is okay. I've requested more hours and have not gotten any. My only income is covering for other employees shifts..
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bjqgtmkl5nd0bc4,2.0,I would not work at this company ever again due to the terrible management that is provided. They do not care about their employees and they will steal from you if they have a chance.
Safeway,1bjq6cr1pb8a7ccg,4.0,"It was fun but it's hard to juggle work and school. I did my best and gave up the job to begin job corps. the people were cool and i enjoyed the work place, nothing dull at all."

Safeway,1bjo297v15n8s961,3.0,As a employee of Safeway the store was clean and management was available if you needed them for assistance. The hours were good for me as student. I enjoyed helping the customers and talking with them while still doing my job.
Safeway,1bjo0v7ds5n8sddh,3.0,"It provided great benefits a medical care , however poor job training skills by management us mainly why I was not there for too long of time and it was a poor work environment for those who can not do things fast paced . Although some people were very nice , I was called stupid and had an anxiety attack because of it , I learned not to stay at a job if I dislike it."
Safeway,1bjnubisib8a3fe0,4.0,"I've worked at Safeway for about 5 years or so, all of that time in the Bakery department. The work isn't too difficult but definitely more tough than you would think. Constantly having to lift and move freight, on your feet all day long, physically demanding. As long as your fellow employees are fun to work with and do a good job then Safeway is enjoyable. I was able to advance in the company and become a manager while being under the age of 25. I've had good and bad store managers, so definitely depends on location. Work life balance is very difficult, if you're working full time 40 hours it's hard to have a personal life. If you have availability problems good luck getting any hours!"
Safeway,1bjmm3odib85pcak,3.0,"I've worked for this company for many years and they have been very good to me in terms of compensation and opportunity for growth.  However, the work life balance is not there as demands keep increasing and help decreases."
Safeway,1bjmhq9gnb8a3e50,3.0,"I worked in every department for about 4 years. ICC. Produce. Meat. Dairy. Liquor. Floral. Bakery. Day Stock. Night Stock. You name it, I did it. I'd work 32-48 hrs a week because sometimes OT was necessary to get the job done. Whatever it takes, I am a team player."
Safeway,1bjl8gvssak5bbik,2.0,I worked there before the Albertsons merger as a head clerk I worked my way up from the bottom. this was just like high school in the inappropriate  conduct and Rumors that even the upper management took part in.
Safeway,1bjjvi6peak54f0i,3.0,"It was okay working here. Management sucked but the customers were really nice, they were also understanding. I was payed well enough and the schedule worked with my school schedule."

Safeway,1bjja5f7rb82mem8,1.0,The Manager is very unprofessional. The assistant managers are no better then the manager. Some are nice. A job is a job. But you won't have respect!!
Safeway,1bjit86ltb82mdj6,5.0,the customer service is a must and you should be a people person if you plan to move up in the company you can't be mean and grumpy and expect to the Store Manager
Safeway,1bjiqbppd5j4r9ak,5.0,it was a very good place to work. it is in a nice community and all of the people are very nice. management is great and they are willing to work with you.

Safeway,1bjgodgmc5nclcp1,3.0,"Safeway as a whole is a beautiful place to work at, from the beautiful women that fill the Starbucks to the beautiful fruits and vegetation in the produce section,"
Safeway,1bjgmecjp1bg93ab,3.0,"Overall, working at Safeway was a fun way to learn about a company especially as a courtesy clerk where not much people regard you. It is just that you are not seen really well by others because of social stigmas but overall it is a interesting work experience especially when trying to understand how an entry level job is like"
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bjgkue9gb86bemn,3.0,as a barista you get called in to work very often due to short staff or sick calls at least once to three times every two weeks which means more hours but for little pay the most enjoyable part of the job is the kind hearted customers but the scheduling needs work
Safeway,1bjghp5vvaqgvfbu,3.0,"During my time working for Safeway I observed the redundant, disrespectful conduct of a manager towards their departments' employees, that was reported repeatedly to higher management but the situation never improved, and drove away good workers. I also witnessed signs of favoritism being shown by a member of store management to an employee, such as getting more hours than senior members in the same department and taking extra breaks without any disciplinary action being taken."
Safeway,1bje22h4152sse34,4.0,"Safeway is a decent company to work for as a first job while in your teens.  I was trained in all aspects of the company, but I was never given a full time position."
Safeway,1bjc68hmcb82md6o,4.0,Great place it a way to meet people and get to make relationships with them. Favorite part was getting the regular costumers in and knowing what they already wanted to drink
Safeway,1bjbuus37b85p8va,3.0,It was an easy place to work with but poorly managed. Most of my co-workers were nice but some were highly child-like. The management was well around the store but never listened to many suggestions and wouldn't pay you very well unless threatened to leave.
Safeway,1bjbrq3ajak92fiq,4.0,Descent place too work especially if you have small children or attend school. Routes are flexible can obtain other jobs cause it's seasonal. Your out in thee summer. You don't have any benefits but if your Lively hood is made then you have no worries but if ur trying to have benefits and make a living then this is not the typical job.
Safeway,1bjbnjiahb85pcka,2.0,I would greet customers with a smile as I bag there groceries. Ask if they would want help out with the groceries. Clean the store with a mop and sweeper.
Safeway,1bjb89p3fakh0dt8,5.0,Very adaptable position. Easy going work atmosphere but you must be hard working. Deadlines are extremely important. Great training by management. Fun atmosphere
Safeway,1bjb744b45j4r9tl,2.0,"Your will do sweeps,bagging, and collecting carts. Customers are generally friendly and very grateful when you help them to find items and assist them to their cars. Your schedule will be all over the place unless you are opening or closing."
Safeway,1bjapu51fakd0d6j,5.0,A typical day here would consist of scanning or checking items. The mornings were usually the slowest as for the afternoons it was always busy. I learned how to memorize numbers on stickers which helped me move quicker as I would be checking food.
Safeway,1bj9ku6mvb85pcs0,3.0,"Load groceries deliver return unload totes. To work with others at the store or on the road. Didn't know manager well had 4 in the 5 years I was there. The work place great people I worked with at the store, at the dock, in dotcom area. No hard parts about the job. the most enjoyable were the guys / Drivers I worked with. Was hard to be there 4.5 years and new people come in starting pay the same as yours they should have fixed the pay with time served"
Safeway,1bj9k9nembrcmdjr,3.0,This job taught me to be a smarter planner. In the beginning I struggled to keep up with the workload and I felt over whelmed but the more I planned out my routine the faster I completed my tasks the less stressed I felt.
Safeway,1bj9c16qmb85pclv,4.0,I really enjoyed working here! My manager was kind of a jerk but my co-workers were awesome! I worked as a cashier and stocked when I wasn't in the register.
Safeway,1bj8qejm5b82mfqe,3.0,"Safeway was a great company, but purchase by VC has jobs leaving Pleasanton, California."
Safeway,1bj8n3qrhak54dns,4.0,Come in and make sure my bags and register was accurate. After I went from a bagger to cashier. I would converse and make sure the groceries they wanted are scanned and placed properly in the bag. I would make sure I went fast and remembered all the numbers for veggies etc.
Safeway,1bj8ks61pbrcmf29,2.0,"Understaffed in order to stay in budget, so employees are worked pretty hard, with long hours. Sometimes hard to complete all the work that needs to be done within your shift, however if you stay over to complete the work, you will get in trouble for doing overtime. As well as you will get in trouble if the works not done, so it's a lose lose situation."
Safeway,1bj8jri39b85pf3v,3.0,First job I ever had. A good place to start out a working carreer not a great place to work long term. Inconsistencies with work schedule a detriment.
Safeway,1bj8hiii4brcmavp,2.0,"This was my summer job right out of high school. It was a good job for just earning some extra cash. Very easy, and not a hard process getting hired at all."
Safeway,1bj897evb5ncla9t,1.0,"The work is monotonous, at least for the position I had. The managers were always upset and arguing with other managers or employees. I was afraid to speak to my managers when I had issues or questions."
Safeway,1bj79presb82mf25,4.0,I would recommend working here as job since they had great staff and the people were great to with and everyone was friendly. It was small area so everyone knew each other

Safeway,1bj6js4ptakcucgd,4.0,Anyone can do it so don't expect more than minimum wage. A need job for a summer. You can move up and get promoted but the pay doesn't get much better until management.
Safeway,1bj6fdi665n8ha7m,2.0,The fellow employees are very kind and they are willingly to help others. The manager is flexible for your schedule and but some times there are problems with your schedule.
Safeway,1bj66janj1fdl0vp,4.0,If you like working with people and love helping customers to either check-out their goods then this is it because you would be helping people with what ever they want.
Safeway,1bj60agdqb84j8ki,5.0,"Beginning my day on time with a smile to interact with peers and customers.  The vast majority of my work experience with Safeway was as a Checker in the check out line.  Here I conducted myself professionally, happily and with speed as the Check out counter can be fast paced.  I greeted my customers, thanked them by name, accepted payment, suggested items, anticipated their needs, bagged up their groceries and asked if needed assistance to their car."
Safeway,1bj4g4j5sb84jdh9,5.0,I have nothing but positive things to say regarding my experience with this company. As long as you are a committed employee that does what is expected they will treat you with nothing but respect.
Safeway,1bj4bl09t1fdl49v,5.0,A typical day at work in mostly about managing time and do all work with patience and carefully.work place culture is fun and productive.
Safeway,1bj46kk82b84j9g5,5.0,"Only worked there for 1 year, but it was always so very exciting to go to work. Regulars would come to my check out to talk and see me!"
Safeway,1bj3sev09ak5094q,5.0,"At safeway there were rarely moments the employees weren't smiling, and the customers definitely saw this and were a part of it. It's important to have this. Management took care of their employees, so the employees took care of the customers."
Safeway,1bj3dsanib82f854,3.0,"A typical day requires me to listen to many customers questions and  give them quick concise answers. The management does a good job knowing when you are excelling, thus allowing you to work more on your own without being analyzed."
Safeway,1bj3bsbs30mtv5db,4.0,A typical day at Safeway ESC was busy and fast paced. I learned to identify what caused problems that may occur with payroll and how and and where I needed to go to correct the mistakes.  Management was good but could be a bit unapproachable. The culture was enjoyable most of the time. I would say the hardest part of the job was lack of communication between management and subordinates.  Changes would occur and we would not be informed of them until the day of the change and we were the first point of contact for callers.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me was to be able to assist callers/employees with payroll issues and bring them to a successful conclusion.
Safeway,1bj3531og52spct5,3.0,Manager was mean but has since left. I swept floors and cleaned the bathrooms for very little money. In addition to this I cleaned up necessary aisles when there was a mess. I made minimum wage.
Safeway,1bj333gc8b89offf,4.0,"There is no typical day at Safeway, for me at least. I have been trained for many different departments and do something new almost everyday. I have learned how to do checkout, how to make arrangements/bouquets. Lastly, to be more organized as well as learned the basics of customer service. Management had good days and bad days with their employees, as does every company. The hardest part of the job would be being crossed trained. When you're trained for multiple departments and ever department needs you, it's difficult to be pulled in every direction at once. The most enjoyable part is being able to be creative in Floral."
Safeway,1bj209vl8b82fdhk,2.0,ok so I had started working here to work in starbucks but within the first two months I was moved and trained in at least 3 other departments.  not a great place to work
Safeway,1bj1phi9cb82ff58,4.0,When a first started at safeway I was afraid to be judged due to my autism so I refrained from making any mention to it. After a year I let the store manager know and nothing changed. Over 2.5 years I learned the skills needed to run a dairy department with the company and was asked if I wanted to run my own. if I was able I would go back to that same work culture.
Safeway,1bj1k6vgvb84jfl7,2.0,Got fired after a few weeks learning how to bag and talk to customers. The manager was very rude because everyone else was gone and she wanted one courtesy clerk to do all the work.
Safeway,1bj1k5kc91fdl5un,2.0,If you are a kid and need a summer job its not a bad learning environment. But overall its not the kind of place you want to work if you have goals in life.

Safeway,1bj19s2vs1fdl4k4,4.0,"As a part-time worker, I did not get to truly reap the benefits of Safeway, though when I worked there I could see that it was a pretty good place to work."
Safeway,1bj0vdc6uakcuast,1.0,working for the bakery was fun because I got to make fresh brad in the mornings and bagels and donuts and other bakery idioms like cookies pie's always loved the early morning and being home at lunch time
Safeway,1bj0v9ml01fdl58a,3.0,Boring time consuming.  Every one in mangement hates each other every one is unfair to each other.  The union there is rediculouse and useless.  You cant get fired there but seems like all the workers want to be fired.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.

Safeway,1biva0sntb82fd4n,3.0,"There's a lot benefits, good hours, but management is difficult to communicate with and get a Long with. Overall,  if you can handle bosses then you'll mostly likely stick with it."
Safeway,1biupb4tfb89jcus,4.0,Thank Goodness.
Safeway,1biuhpkbm1fdl1bd,5.0,a typical day at work just pushing carts on the Safeway parking lot while the weather was at 101 degrees  outside. I learn that when you work for a store like Safeway you need to always be own top of customer service. The management was excellent  always keeping their workers happy and keeping a safely  working environment. The hard part was cleaning the restrooms when certain people made a mess. what I enjoy the most was I got to get along with everyone and they always worked around my school schedule.
Safeway,1biu91iqf1fdl31t,3.0,Typical day starts off by cleaning all the food cases and anything metal. Proceeded by washing any dishes left from the night before. Slicing and serving deli meat and cheese. Serving different premade dishes. Customer service job. Job wasn't hard if you have good customer skills. Loved meeting new people.

Safeway,1bis1qbi71fdl608,3.0,"Safeway was a solid company to work for until the merger with albertson's. lots of corporate change-ups that created a more stressful work environment. All in all, it was a good company to work for with decent benefits."
Safeway,1birmagen1bg60o4,4.0,"After getting the proper training I was able to run the floral department on my own.  Ordering, cleaning, designing."
Safeway,1birl5kfgb89j8np,4.0,safeway is one of the better places i have worked. it's hard but fair work. all the managers at my store were very understanding and worked with you on any problems you may have. only down side i would say is you don't get full hours.
Safeway,1bir7biok5j4ncsh,5.0,I earned a lot about the customer service industry and enjoyed my overall experiences with this company. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a position in customer service.
Safeway,1biq74khcb82faah,1.0,"they claim to be a team but no one there is team players , management is handled poorly , great benefits from working with them but unsafe , dangerous environments"
Safeway,1biptv6pdak50f2n,4.0,I really enjoyed  working at safeway. If i didn't have to come back home to minnesota i would still be employed there. It was a fast paced deli so the time flew by. There was always something to do. Safeway catered to their customers and they went above and beyond to make them happy. Which I thought was great. The whole store was busy. It's a big store but very clean and organized. It was just a nice place to work. The deli was huge and had a wide variety of deli meats and cheeses. We also had a large variety of salads in our deli case. We had a whole deli case of hot food too that eas pretty good. Especially our fried chicken. And we had a sandwich bar where customers could custom order a fresh dandwich. I guess you could say we had it all.
Safeway,1biposke3b82fe79,5.0,"I loved working for Safeway, most of the employees were great but most of all getting to know the customers and knowing them and their families was the best part."
Safeway,1biplce6db89jb6j,2.0,"Easy job mostly includes packaging, labeling, writing on cakes, keeping sales floor stocked, taking special orders, cleaning, and helping customers. I learned about all the different breads, pastries, and desserts that we carry. The workplace culture is very lacking in motivation mostly due to poor management. There were many harrassement issues that were ignored and/or dismissed by management usually in a very unprofessional manner. The enviroment was hostile, unorganized, and always stressful due to having unqualified supervisors in charge. The most enjoyable part of the job was writing on cakes and adding decorative touches. The hardest part was dealing with an unprofessional supervisor who had no regard for food safety and personally attacked/harrassed the employees and created a very distractng work enviroment."
Safeway,1bipgefclb82f84s,1.0,Store Manager was the worst and had no idea how to make a schedule. Treats employees with disrespect and treats their jobs lower than her own. All around poor leader and treats her workers poorly.
Safeway,1bipelrb00mtv30v,5.0,When I worked at starbucks it wasn't that popular there was always a line out the door and I worked in a little kiosk but I had a lot of fun my manager was really cool.

Safeway,1binp8ekeb82fcl2,3.0,My manager was fantastic however upper management was awful. You got weird an inconsistent hours and you never got overtime. It was very fast pace and you never felt like there was time to get everything done and they put me on closing after working there for a very short time. The most enjoyable part was the costumers and my manager. They made the job tolerable.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bin1o3u6b82ffqk,5.0,The job was required you to always move so time would pass by very fast. The people i worked with really made my job amazing. They were all so friendly.
Safeway,1bin13o3c1fdl5oi,4.0,working at Safeway was a great learning experience to build a great foundation in customer service skills. if i have had the opportunity to work at ranstad(Google work project) i would still be working at Safeway. its a great place to work yourself up the latter and learn from the different departments. Safeway really take care of the employees
Safeway,1bimvn4b7b84jfqo,4.0,"Both jobs are physically demanding. Have to be able to bend, lift, carry and/or push carts from the lot. In produce you cut fruits and veggies daily for sale on the sales floor. It a process of making things easier for the customer for their home life. With Courtesy Clerk you serve customers on front end, from greeting to bagging their groceries to taking them to their car and loading car. You retrieve carts from the lot on 1/2 hr basis on hot days. I have to say I enjoyed the people I met while working here. Most are family friendly."
Safeway,1bimmr5561fdl0op,2.0,"Great benefits, high employee turnover and lack of skilled upper management. Low pay for entry level positions, ongoing labor cuts affect productivity."

Safeway,1bimcl607b89jcol,4.0,This was a fun job to work at. Flexible hours and there is a lot of room for advancement. Management was always respectful. The only hard part was working during the summer when it was really hot.
Safeway,1bim6j7m3akcsdqp,4.0,"This location was by far one of my best working experiences.  My management team was great, and they encouraged my growth within the company.  Our team worked very well together which made it such a pleasant place to work."
Safeway,1bil30nrlb82hdbv,3.0,"I like this place, just wish they would crack down on the theft, poor management, only because there is a lack of hours due to the theft....someone needs to come in there and set these people straight, but you can't do that because this is a liberal state and you wouldn't want to hurt anyone's feelings...its ridiculous if you ask me. I work hard and pay upwards of 30% in taxes...my work ethic is unparalleled.  Time to move to a red state."

I have worked in Pharmacy for 6 years and enjoy all of my customers and being able to help them back to health."
Safeway,1bikdt776b89da8s,1.0,"Clearly a lack of communication within the store, does not care about employees and promotes gossip among management team and workers, general manager joked about firing employees in front of other employees, degrading and disrespectful, openly talks to customers about employees wages... I could go on, just a hostile environment and not worth the stress to stay with this company. There were a lot of unhappy employees and it was just depressing."
Safeway,1bik4e8ubbrehdp4,4.0,"a typical day at safeway was honesty very stressful, we were under a lot of pressure and it was really difficult to keep up w all of managements requests and requirements w the hours we were given. we were not treated equally w other departments, but we always did our best to get our product out, and make everything look decently presented."
Safeway,1bijno2d1b89ddef,4.0,Most managers are caring and providing to your needs. your work is well recognized and it is a great place to move up in promotions when starting at entry level.
Safeway,1bijk9ke0breh997,3.0,Working at Safeway you need a lot of energy and good customer service. The other staff are supportive. The hardest part of the job is the schedule. The best part of the job - is you know you worked hard that day. I learned a lot about customer service.
Safeway,1biji6d54breheho,3.0,"Work in the back end. Professional Shopper. Manager was on a short fuse most days. If the Manager was off, work days were very good. Great co-workers and the assistant Manager worked well with everyone."
Safeway,1biig81m152snfu4,4.0,Managers show favoritism. Work place is messy as far as the people . They act more like friends than managers . Talk about employees amongst eachother.
Safeway,1biif6lm0b89dfab,4.0,"The other departments besides the deli seem great.  I have heard from co-workers that they really like the people they work for.  However, the deli is another story.  I was advised from another manager that I should move on and find another job.  His reasoning was it would take two years for me to get a decent raise and the sweat and the effort that I was putting forth would not be rewarded.  So to sum things up deli no, any other department is good."
Safeway,1biib761fb89d90k,4.0,"If you have never had a job this would be a great place to start at. Courtesy clerks have the easiest job, If you could put up with the supervisors then it shouldn't be a problem, all you do most of the time is bag groceries for customers."
Safeway,1bihtjsnqb852a21,1.0,"They demanded so much from you without rewarding yo. I gave my boss my schedule that she knew 6 months ahead and she barely looked at it and tossed it, and still wanted me to come in when I gave her my schedule."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bihs3pkoakcqd5e,5.0,"I enjoyed going into Safeway/Vons everyday typically because as soon as you walked into the doors you had a task to do but everyone still managed to make time to have a great relationship with our team. I learned how to adapt to working with different groups of people which helped me at Chase. I was taught the importance of verifying the points of interest when negotiating a negotiable item when I was a Cashier. The hardest part of my job was doing price changes. At the same time it was very enjoyable doing it with our team. The hours were hard if I had to choose. The most enjoyable part of the job, was the professionalism I learned as a teenager and the staff I worked with."
Safeway,1bihmr4teb82h9k9,3.0,"Grocery business is tough,  the hours are long and you can expect to work many hours over the years.  Lots of people been around a long time at all levels."
Safeway,1bihfkdupb852drk,3.0,I have only been working at Safeway.com for a short time but I already see some flaws. You never know when you have to report to work until that day when you get a text from dispatch. The time varies so much that its hard to make any plans outside of work.
Safeway,1biha8m9sbreh92o,5.0,"great place to work, its hard work but it keeps you busy and its fun. the pay isnt the best, but its a good company. wish they wouldnt start you off part time"
Safeway,1bifrn3e0b8978c0,5.0,"My duties at Safeway was just to load any beverages that was low on the shelf and also organize the back stock in the back by using pallet jacks, etc. I would have to unload the load every night from the shipments we would get from the mainland."
Safeway,1bifkqqj8ak4r99a,2.0,work hours cant support a family nor basic living. the pay is to low for the fast pace position. the customers are great they just want to be treated with respect.
Safeway,1bifk76ngakcldkv,3.0,The pharmacy where I work can be pretty intense. We do our best to do right by the customers while looking out for the bottom line of the company. They seem to be reducing hours when work load feels like it's increasing.
Safeway,1bifeljurak4rc3n,2.0,i would get there at 6 and stand in a room for 8 hours cutting fruit i didnt enjoy it. some people were great but some people were horrible. an older worker who worked there a long time got me introuble a lot because for some reason she hated me.
Safeway,1bife195cb814e35,3.0,"I have been employed with Safeway for 13 year's, it is a good company to work for the expectation's of the company are not out of reach as far as daily tasks."
Safeway,1bif4up0lb897eum,2.0,"Everyone including the managers are great! Having to work with the managers are tough for me becuase I would ask for time off and they wouldn't give it to me, however they would give it to other employees."
Safeway,1bietg8rmb81499d,2.0,"A typical day the moment you clock in, your supervisor is breathing down your neck to do something another department should have done hours prior. Once that was done your supervisor will force you to go outside to perform cart duties when there was easily only 4-6 carts no where near the store while there is a rush."
Safeway,1biesk03sakglbgc,4.0,"Great benefits,  good pay. Works around school schedules.  Advancement is available in every department.  Great staff and Management.  Must be available weekends and holidays."
Safeway,1biesceok0kbu6ea,5.0,A great place to shop & a even better place to work. Made allot of friends. Some I still see today. I quickly became a favorite. Management & employees.
Safeway,1bierrvq1bre8emp,3.0,"A job that offered benifits, biweekly pay. Great people and advancement opportunities. Not much diversity in this region as far as management or hourly positions."
Safeway,1biej2uk7b814fre,4.0,"A typical day at work is usually busy, since it is retail, I learned how to handle different situations and apply different customer service techniques, the management was good, I never had any trouble switching shifts with anyone or making time to be at work, the workplace is a friendly environment, I enjoyed working with a lot of the people there, the hardest part of the job was getting carts, if it was really hot, or really cold, it made it difficult to get the carts inside in the snow but the job got done. I think the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and talking to them, getting to know how their day was going."
Safeway,1biefdo6pbre8bfn,3.0,"Great paying job, you have to deal with a lot of stress, that's what the union environment does. I got so much knowledge from being crossed trained asking questions"
Safeway,1biec87v61ah73b1,4.0,"I am a delivery driver for this company. While the hours can fluctuate quite a bit, if one is money savvy then there should be no problem. The flexibility of the schedules are probably the most notable highlight of this job which is great for someone who may be going to school or anything else. Unfortunately there is promise of increased pay, advancement, and full-time work, all of which seem to be unlikely as I have been working with this company for well over a year."
Safeway,1biebsq2fak4p9fc,3.0,I worked at safeway as a courtesy clerk if you don't like cleaning I wouldn't recommend the task. You start off at 7.25 so I would recommend this job for a teen. You just clean around the store bag groceries and collect carts outside. Not hard at all. The bakery was better because I got to work in the department by myself the independence made me want to work even harder because no one could distract me or tell me what to do. I didn't like how they still made the courtesy clerks get carts in the scorching sun or cold winter with no remorse. It's a good job if you're in school they understand your availability but will give you less hours not more just to save money.
Safeway,1bidjfeecbre8b7s,3.0,Safeway is a fast paced grocery chain.  Working here is can be challenging or very slow depending on what your job is.  It can be very tedious work with long hours.
Safeway,1bid7m61qbre8dt4,3.0,Good starting job in the customer service industry recommend if you want to get to know the ropes and are looking for good people to work with and grow with.

Safeway,1biceof3jbre89ip,4.0,"I worked for the Safeway in Duvall, WA for over 3 years. I started as a courtesy clerk and moved up to a food clerk, assisting other departments as needed. The community there is pretty good, but upper management (district/corporate level) has a slight negative effect on the store as a whole (from what I observed). Good for a starting job, but recommend not making a lifelong career in Safeway (though this particular store isn't bad for it)"
Safeway,1bic64v82akglea2,4.0,"Back room merchandise processing; organize unloaded merchandise; process transfer or damaged items; maintain the store during the night making sure the store looks neat professional, customer service, cashiers and help manage and order for the Milk Dept."
Safeway,1bic1emoob814fus,5.0,"I may look at moving into mid-upper management this year. I had a business which I made #125,000 last year and have always had other income options so Safeway was my fun job.  Now it is time to do more !"
Safeway,1biaqviblb814bb4,3.0,It's a good place to work but management is not very organized. Schedules can also be on and off with hours. No set days off on many positions and call in and shift changes happen randomly
Safeway,1bia1erh4ak4md9p,3.0,"Every aspect of working of this company is mediocre. Its not bad, but can definitely be made better. the pay could be higher and most people are not put on full time schedules unless you were already in the old union contracts."
Safeway,1bi9oajbpb878au0,5.0,"Honestly, I hated working here as a courtesy clerk. I feel like you do not get paid enough to be running around all dang day without a break. It's also not a good job for young girls. I was harassed every single day by customers when I would go outside to push carts. Do not recommend this job."
Safeway,1bi9nq9k0b878e8c,4.0,Each day of work at Safeway taught me quick and effective stocking techniques. Maintaining a clean and organized store. Assisting customers to find product and the best deals. The management was flexible with employees needs as well as their work schedule. The company worked promptly to award raises to hard working employees and pushed to help excel them to higher positions of the company if requested.The Graveyard shift was the most difficult part of the job considering it was 11pm to 7am.
Safeway,1bi9lvhelakclco3,3.0,"Proper training was provided, there is an opportunity for advancement. Working at the correct store would offered further advancement and compensation for work provided."
Safeway,1bi9gg9rvb878e4o,3.0,"A typical day at work was very hectic. There was always so much work to do, even with the amount of customers that came every day. It was very difficult to tend to them when there wasn't enough people working. It was also difficult because customers get impatient very quickly. There wasn't any pro of the job."
Safeway,1bi9g6qu4b814e0e,3.0,"Although room for advancement and salary can be a downside, they were very much willing to work with my college schedule during the Fall and Spring semesters."
Safeway,1bi9d4cgub897e83,5.0,"Great Place to work, good benefits.  Fun and productive. Great atmosphere, yup with on. But could use new management, And full time hours. Career advancement."
Safeway,1bi8ofd6naqgldd2,5.0,"A typical day at work consisted of clocking in on the time sheet, going to the check stand to get everything was readily available and organized to start working. I learned good communication skills as well as how to work in a fast paced environment during the peak hours. The management was okay but there was not cohesion within the workplace between the staff and managers. The hardest part of the job would have had to have been learning all of PLU codes and using my time wisely while on the job. The most enjoyable part about the job was interacting with the customers and seeing their faces at the end of each transaction."
Safeway,1bi7ghinvb897932,3.0,its really repetitive most days. the people are fun to work with most of the time. sometimes you have to deal with a mad customer. but for the most part its a good place to work.
Safeway,1bi7avvjtbre8fp1,4.0,"My job involved working with customers, employees and management.  Constantly changing, everyday was different.  Counting money, doing deposits, reports."
Safeway,1bi53bmr80mct4bj,3.0,Dealt with customers from when I clock in until I clock out. Learned how to keep a positive attitude and a great deal of patience. Didn't really get raises from the time I was there. Work schedule was great. Got the hours I wanted. Overall meet some great people and decent full time job.
Safeway,1bi52jc5d0mt70me,2.0,"After working at Safeway for many years, I have become increasingly more upset with how it is run. The pay is poor, the management varies from hard workers in one department to someone who texts on their phone all day while assigning tasks to their co-workers in another. Depending on where you work, you could get anywhere from 10 to 40 hours of work a week, but it will vary so much week to week that you will never be able to reliably predict how much you'll be getting paid. The employees overall are very nice. At my store, there were quite a few people who had worked their for more than fifteen years, and seemed to plan on that being their career for life. However, these people are the only ones. Every employee I've worked with who did not start a long time ago has left for a hundred different reasons. Varying hours, an uncaring or lazy manager, and poor pay were the most common reasons."
Safeway,1bi50taef0kbu3jc,4.0,"My 2 years there were generally enjoyable. Hours were okay, people friendly; relatively easy job. As a courtesy clerk there's a lot to clean up usually. So just prepare to be needed."
Safeway,1bi4vfkkh0mt776c,5.0,"A typical work day at Safeway was always an interesting and productive one. Being employed there for a year taught me a whole lot. I was able to better my customer service skills, better my work ethic, and also learn whats it was like to be promoted for doing my job so well. Management there was good, but there's always room for improvement. The hardest part about working at Safeway was knowing how to put my emotions aside and still be off great service to a customer and the most enjoyable part about the job was the environment, even though everyday wasn't perfect I never really had a bad day."
Safeway,1bi4k8mvrbre88qb,5.0,Shift from 11pm - 7am . Friendly employees that are always willing to help. Stock shelves and face isles. Pick up cardboard and make sure isles are clean and tidy.
Safeway,1bi4gfe5hbre8c78,5.0,"Learned a lot from this job I've gotten employe of the month, great working environment, worked in almost every department learned a lot from management, and none stop working all 8 hours of the day 40 hours a week."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bi37gc9eak4mc0n,5.0,In Texas a lot of the stores were older and I guess they had lived out there expectancy and the owner was selling off.teamsters union really hurt this company in Texas area I have never been a union man and was not a part of the union when I worked there. Do not believe in it.
Safeway,1bi2tbes4b8118k8,1.0,This is a good job for a teen that lives with his mom in the basement. don't get too comfortable there are better options for you when you turn 18 . believe this
Safeway,1bi26698lbre48ta,2.0,"it was a good place to get started, not much room for advancement and did not pay very well, you also had to pay union dues which the did not compensate the pay for."
Safeway,1bi1u5p7nbre4dms,5.0,"I miss working at Safeway/Vons, great opportunity to grow as individual and career wise.  It just takes time for advancement due to people not leaving the company as often. The shifts can be difficult due to constant change for coverage. Can be strenuous on the family due to the constant change or working weekends, nights and holidays."
Safeway,1bi0dru6rb84ob9f,1.0,For such a big company the pay is not worth the work you give. Way to many managers and not enough workers. No teamwork or communication I learned I don't want to work in the grocery industry again
Safeway,1bi08me4maqgjdhq,3.0,"The job was necessary to pay for university but the management had several people more interested in making themselves look good than actually managing (or in some cases, actually carry out minor personal attacks in front of customers)"
Safeway,1bi08g09gakcidvj,4.0,I haven't been working at Safeway long enough to give a hard and strong opinion of the place.. That being said so far I like it. My co-workers and my customers tend to be friendly for the most part. Its a nice place to work.
Safeway,1bhvuud0db8118e3,3.0,They don't really care about you they just want the work done so you have to do it. I never really liked working there it seemed like I was always being watched under a microscope and if I do anything wrong there to pounce on me
Safeway,1bhvu0l3s0mcr1e4,3.0,"My duties required me to be an all around worker, duties was basically whatever they ask me to do as a service clerk from pulling trash, to stocking groceries, to gathering grocery carts etc,etc,I also performed special duties when asked by my supervisor."
Safeway,1bhvso13paqgjflk,3.0,It's a good place to work just has a lot of boss's  and too many people telling you what to do I lived working there but some people take it to far. The pay is good
Safeway,1bhvrguc5b811buu,3.0,"It was an okay job, but the pay was not that good. The management was not good, they would let days pass by before they replaced things that we needed in the deli even after we asked."
Safeway,1bhvarsdi0mtm583,1.0,"With the exception of my direct supervisor and a couple of my fellow managers, management is a joke at this company. 1/10 would not apply again unless i absolutely 100% had to"

Safeway,1bhtk2vofb81qekn,5.0,Great work environment and work benefits. Management could be better. I learned to work with a larger group of people and learned accounting and bookkeeping skills. I also learned a lot about merchandising and the grocery business.
Safeway,1bhthi0vcb81qfqd,3.0,"Typical day was taking care of customers, collecting carts, cleaning of restrooms/deli counter/meet counter/bakery.  I learned working along side others is a privilege. Management could be better. The workplace culture, I made some friends there. The hardest part of my job was collection of carts.  The most enjoyable part of my job was taking trash to the dumpster."
Safeway,1bhte61rvak8lf04,4.0,"After paying initial union dues compensation is quite good, so are the health benefits associated with being a part of the UFCW. Hour can be irregular which is tough on family life."

Safeway,1bht10grs0mco6gb,1.0,great people managers was ok some time but not all the time safeway taught me how to manage my time and it gave me great customer service skills the the work environment was excellent
Safeway,1bhsq8l1jbrdtb73,2.0,"The company has been going through a corporate restructuring since they have been taken over by Albertson's which has led to a massive downhill effect on management. This puts all the strain on the workers to over-perform while also managing the cut backs on help and hours. It is not a place you want to work if you value a positive culture, or cannot handle a high stress lifestyle. This may vary based on the attitude of the employees at each store, but the atmosphere does not foster positive attitudes."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bhso70lib81q9te,5.0,Safeway taught me comprehensively to be a manager.  I was able to learn in every department as an RLD candidate.  The management training program is amazing.
Safeway,1bhsn5gkvbrdtfhd,3.0,"My review is simply this, I am willing to work starting now. Thank you. I would like a job consisting of 8 hours a day. 4 to 5 days a week to be able to support myself and someone else that might live with me."
Safeway,1bhsio876b88m9vm,4.0,"Very high paced with lots of customer interaction. If you are bored in the deli, you are not working hard enough, there is always something to be doing there. Co-workers were great. Store management was good."
Safeway,1bhsdvrve5ndkake,1.0,Very Stressful environment. Everything has to be done now. Work 6 days a week only off on Mondays. Working every weekend. No time to spend with family. Doing alot of the work by myself.
Safeway,1bhra9k37b88mdum,4.0,This company has great benefits and is a fun place to work. They however do not like to take into consideration the lives of their workers. They are not willing to work with your schedule if it does not suit them.
Safeway,1bhqv9qh1b81qfqs,4.0,"All of my coworkers were friendly, but management was awful. Schedules were often posted late, then abruptly changed. Manager always had a kind of rude/condescending tone."
Safeway,1bhqijigebrdtfnu,5.0,I worked there for 6 years. I worked my way all the way to be a jounry man cashier. If you are looking for a place to start your first job this is where to go. You get benifets and 401k and stocl options
Safeway,1bhqi4huub85n9ld,4.0,"I have enjoyed working at Safeway but only as a means to pay rent and school, I wouldn't make it a full time career. But a good part time job for that extra money in the pocket."
Safeway,1bhop4v0k0kbp7rn,5.0,"Cash office is a position that allows me to work by myself in a back office while handling and processing cash. Typically cash office is only for a few hours and is done before the store opens. It isn't hard, but it is a lengthy and detailed process and there are steps that must be taken in order or else the whole process will have errors. Typically you count the safe, change drawer and registers making sure they balance, followed by preparing deposits(check and cash), advancing drawers, then opening registers and receiving manager approval before store doors open to the public. I learned a good amount, mainly understanding how the money and registers are prepped for the day. The hardest part of the job would be having to find missing money and fixing the errors of others when there isn't a lead on what could have happened. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work without supervision, and being allowed the time to complete and focus on the task at hand."
Safeway,1bhol2eddb88me24,4.0,They were pretty cool about everything you just come in an do your job and the people were cool at least where I worked. It may vary from place to place.
Safeway,1bhoa6b3jb88m8oi,5.0,"Safewaybwas a good place to work. Some of the managers get a ""better than thou"" attitude, but for the moat part, i loved it. I worked in every department of the store."
Safeway,1bho0o8deb85naje,3.0,Safeway gave me a lot of opportunities while employed there that I do not feel many other companies would have given me. I have been there a very long time and it has been worth it.
Safeway,1bhnuq49qb88mepg,4.0,"It's really easy to get stuck at Safeway, but it's a great place to start and get some experience in the real work. The relationships are top notch. It can be very stressful, and your experience will definitely depend on the store you end up at, but if you work hard you'll be appreciated and be able to make it a really great place to go professionally."
Safeway,1bhnj12nt1ahj33j,3.0,"A good place to start your career and get your foot in the door. The schedule and shifts leave a little to be desired, understanding of course it is retail."
Safeway,1bhn9tur61ahj785,5.0,great job great company great teaching skills good benefitshopefully I can go back in miss working for this company learned a lot and got my love for food started
Safeway,1bhll5d01b81qdlp,4.0,"A fast paced work environment with friendly employees, competent management, and great hours until a change in management that saw my hours cut and many undeserved punishments."
Safeway,1bhlh459u1agi5va,3.0,Management can be very distant. Customer can be very rude. A very physically challenging job. Not a lot of room for advancement. Overall not my favorite place to work
Safeway,1bhlf0k6vak8laat,3.0,a typical day is making sure the store is faced up and in the good condition.  Doing our best to keep the lines short even tho we may not get the support that we want from upper management.  Supporting the staff so that they can give customer a great experience so that they shop with us again
Safeway,1bhl3bf87b81qc0j,4.0,Arrive to work on time clocking in cleaning and making sure your check stand is ready for customers going on break is the best part because some customers can be rude but the most part some customers are very nice you can learn a lot from them
Safeway,1bhl1tspmb81qcd3,4.0,"Management matters here. Store management can change frequently based on their performance and attitude. Secret shoppers abound, so be on your guard at all times. Good work is rewarded frequently. Incentive programs for employees work well. Was not part of the union, though most of the store was."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bhkr0bnubrdteb3,4.0,I have worked at Safeway for a little over a month as an order selector. While my time their has been short i have learned a lot and would greatly recommend a Safeway job to any of my friends or family.
Safeway,1bhj92bs10mco1f2,3.0,"If you are new to the workforce and is looking for a job, Safeway is a good way to start off! They provide benefits, the pay is okay, and you have room to move on up. Whether you start off as a courtesy clerk, then become a checker or move to a different department like the floral or deli. You can gain great experience from working here. It teaches you to work on your customer service since you are dealing with customers on a daily basis. And it will really test out how you work under pressure when it comes to a crazy busy day and you are running around like a chicken with their head cut off."
Safeway,1bhj85f88b85nemm,5.0,easy to get the job done with helpful and friendly coworkers.  I got to work with all customers and co-workers.  managers were helpful.  understanding of health conditions
Safeway,1bhiels4ebrdt9pi,4.0,"Very busy at times,learned a lot about everyday store operations. Co-workers were like family and we always pulled together to get things done as a team.I enjoyed keeping busy and learning new things daily to be able to give the best service to our customers."
Safeway,1bhhokfehak9v9em,5.0,Its a nice place to work while still in school. The day at work is usually routine.  I liked working with the customers because they appreciated the assistance I provided to them.
Safeway,1bhhatih7ak9v9a9,3.0,"Overall it's mediocre, the negatives balanced out any positives so it just comes to a middle ground of ""not horrible, not great"". What really bothered me about working here though was that it wasn't a cooperative community, if anything it was the opposite. Departments seemed like they would just pawn off their problems on to the others and as the night crew a lot of that laziness would pile on to us. Management was unresponsive at best and excessively nitpicky at worst. Day off requests were generally honored however after a point they no longer honored my request to have a specific day off of the regular schedule. Co-workers were a bit hit-or-miss some where really good but others would backbite and gossip. Now for the customer service, the benefits of overnight work was that there was less customer service but make no mistake there will still be a lot both direct and indirect. After closing you'll likely have people trying to be cheeky and get their shopping done while the store is closed and give you the stink eye or berate you if you tell them that the store is closed. Indirectly you'll have to clean up the messes people would leave on shelves or relocate items to their proper places. Overall I don't feel like my time working here was wasted (resume fluff, payment, etc) but I would say my time there caused me to become fairly jaded. If you get a chance for something better I would implore you to take it but if you have no better job prospects this should be sufficient."
Safeway,1bhgst4evbrdjbje,3.0,"Not enough hours, confusing scheduling. I have been here almost a year now and still only ever get closing shifts. Management doesn't listen to employee concerns. Sick days are a joke."
Safeway,1bhgsgra4brdjd2e,2.0,A typical day would be me working almost every position in the store because I was reliable. Working at a very fast pace and being attentive to every customers needs.
Safeway,1bhgsfjfib857foc,3.0,"I worked for safeway over 6 years ago i worked as a Helper clerk stocking shelves, its a pretty average job not to much different from any other big stores."
Safeway,1bhgle2joak5rft6,2.0,Cashier job can be tough due to large rushes of customers at certain times of day. Most of the workers are polite and understanding. Job environment will depend on quality and personality of the managers which seem to vary as I had one head manager and two assistant managers. Hours tend to be six to eight hour shifts with a half hour break. Each time of the day has its pros and cons. There is no actual enjoyable part of the job.
Safeway,1bhgkq5l5b83c9hp,3.0,"If you've learned all you need to learn and are ready for the mundane, this is your place. If you're looking to learn new methods, technologies, etc, this is NOT your stopping point, but a bump in your road."
Safeway,1bhgcd6p91d123p1,3.0,"could not count on anything, union dues were high with no benefits. This job was extremely stressful, someone always trying to blame you for something,"
Safeway,1bhg9cuct1ba43hq,3.0,A typical day at work for me would be providing superior service to ever customer that I see while abiding  by company policies and procedures.
Safeway,1bhg85pn1b85797k,4.0,Safeway is a fast-paced working evironment. Management is there to help you learn and to get to where you want to go. The department is constantly training the employees so that we are all up to date and on the same level too achieve our goals.
Safeway,1bhg4vscr1d123pq,1.0,The pay is ridiculously low. The management is bad and  everyone that works there is backstabbing the other departments. They give  you  bad hours there isnt hardly anyone working there that is full time and people have been with the company for years.
Safeway,1bhg3ue6r1ba46ta,5.0,I worked at my local Safeway all through high school and during my first year of college. I loved my coworkers and felt that the environment was very supportive. I learned a lot about customer service and quality control; skills that I now continue to use in my everyday life.
Safeway,1bhfqv9hobrdj8s5,1.0,No seniority in the business means you don't get many hours. unless you do cashier where you stand in one place all day. you make minimum wage with 5 cent increases every like 7 months and top out pay is like 13 something.
Safeway,1bhfq258mb83catk,5.0,I am/was very introverted.  They had confidence in me. And gave me the opportunity to become a cashier from a courtesy clerk. Great management. Loved the people I worked with.
Safeway,1bhfl9iakb857e4c,3.0,"Safeway is a good first job, truly taught me to work hard. It seems at Safeway like they do not care for you but at the end of the day they have to run a business ."
Safeway,1bhfk4tkpb857ah4,5.0,This is a great place to work!  They offer excellent pay and benefits.  Management cares about and supports all employees and treats them with respect.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bhfg862q1bg34nf,4.0,Very high paced job.  Management was the hardest to adjust to.  always wanting something different.  The work was fine as long as had the employees needed other wise very stressful.
Safeway,1bhfdq1h6b857aul,2.0,"Great starting positions for the high school student. Nothing worth staying for, unless you come from dual incomes, don't pay your own bills, or you need steady medical insurance."
Safeway,1bhebs3df1ai6489,3.0,Courtesy Clerk Pushing carts sweeping and bagging groceries
Safeway,1bhebpimfb83cbi9,4.0,Mostly if your looking to make a lot of money here's the place use to get plenty of over time but cut back recently overall good paying job good people
Safeway,1bhdklumvb83ce03,2.0,Not the best company to get promoted in and grow any additional skills. Many employees have to save money for future surgery on backs and knees. Once an employee makes the top store management they realize that the hours needed to fulfill job requirements leaves no time for family or free time.
Safeway,1bhdkhol4b857bsp,5.0,"Was a great learning experience in customer service and learned to deal with all kinds of people and approach with great attitude and affection, great knowledge toward my customer experience."

Safeway,1bhd9l1fm1ahk2bu,5.0,A job that has security and test your skills when it comes to patience. Teaches you how to stay organized and keeps your mind fresh on mathematics and being organized. You meet a lot of people and you also grow as a person.
Safeway,1bhd40948ak5r8p1,4.0,"Sign in, cut & display meat to be sold. made grind of lean to fatty."
Safeway,1bhcq9dqj5n9cckc,2.0,starting out Safeway is a good job. but i do not recommend trying to have a career in Safeway. they will cut your hours and leave u barely making rent
Safeway,1bhbj85efb8bmavf,2.0,Management will do everything to push you around and treats employees like children. Union however will fight for you to keep your job if they fire you for most circumstances and guarantees raises based on hours worked
Safeway,1bhacrodhb81be8q,1.0,not a good company. New people every other day. Kinda sums it up. Never felt valued. nice enough people. however management didnt seem to care if you were good or just there.
Safeway,1bh8jjsnab858df4,3.0,"Worked night crew for sometime and loved it for the most part, night management was great and understood team encouragement. Some of the main bosses views were misguided but night crew was great."
Safeway,1bh7v7jquas1r8dh,3.0,"Come in every night or every other nights sometimes, I Clocked in at 12pm & got off at 8am. Unload pallets of groceries off the truck , It would be 6 of us most nights & other nights it would just be me and two other people unloading trucks. Management in my opinion was poor , they showed favoritism , started cutting back on my hours. Typical week for me was 6 days a week and that dropped down to 2 maybe 3 days a week. The workplace was okay wasn't really my type of an environment but I acted accordingly , the hardest part of the job to me would be me having to unload two or three pallets of water , including soda and juice. The most enjoyable part was on my lunch breaks they would allow us to be able to buy food , chips , juices , candy , anything we wanted."
Safeway,1bh7qiuugbrdebvd,2.0,Working here was the poorest I've ever been. I worked minimum wage and only part time. On top of that I had to pay into a union from which I was not eligible for any of it's benefits. Technically making less than minimum wage. This was a very unpleasant experience for me and something I don't look upon fawnly.
Safeway,1bh6oejr3as1rd02,3.0,"Management unreliable and rude, schedule done only 3 days in advance, no help, degrading of employees, some teachable moments, no seniority given and cheap (buy your own uniform)."
Safeway,1bh6kcadhak9o97b,5.0,Working at this job is not the best at pay rates but it is a good starting job. Everyone has to start somewhere they would work with your schedule when needed.
Safeway,1bh697cqrb8bm9md,4.0,Good company to work for but not as big of a footprint in the retail pharmacy space as say a Walgreens or CVS.  Limited locations means limited advancment if thats is something you are looking for.
Safeway,1bh62hlsdb81bfo2,1.0,I won't ever come back to this company since they treat their employees like dogs on a tight and short leash. Hierarchy is not how to run a successful business.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bh5mc384b81b9u7,3.0,Pay is great if you work here long enough. Never enough help and too many things are allowed to happen with no repercussions.  Fellow employees are friendly.
Safeway,1bh3q09pobrdeeim,4.0,"As with any job there are always things that can be improved on.  Definitely not a career choice certain personalities should have, but offers good benefits for employees and teaches team members accountability, responsibility, and work ethics both individual and team wise."
Safeway,1bh3m42nuakdg86i,1.0,"very bad company to work for from every aspect that one can think of.   Poor compensation, poor benefit, substandard professional culture, toxic politics"
Safeway,1bh3em3hvb81babn,4.0,"The job was really easy since it was just a grocery store. The staff was not that great, They let the employees do what they want, They would hold people responsible for their actions. people working there didn't really care, some lazy and laid back. The paid was ok and for part time the hours I got were pretty good."
Safeway,1bh36j29hb8bm991,4.0,"Start your morning by walking the store, check for store conditions and communicate with department heads to identify any opportunities if they arise and start a list of action items. Check emails and distinguish which items to prioritize (throughout the day). Walk the store while performing your daily tasks, communicate with your team every hour or so to get a feel for the pulse of your store. The people I work with at Safeway are great! I've been to a handful of stores and have met some of my best friends in the Safeway work environment. I've learned a lot while working with Safeway, not only about how to run a retail setting but also about life. Safeway has taught me to take nothing for granted and has helped me immensely with my financial goals. The challenging part of the job is managing the resources given and translating that into growing sales while margins shrink. The most enjoyable is working  people, customers and employees alike."
Safeway,1bh365kqeb85880e,3.0,the company it self use to be great  but very sense the ablertson has taken over the business they expect more then one person can do and they dont give enough hours.
Safeway,1bh1b2b7pak9oeeb,3.0,"Typical day at work for me was pushing carts(no matter the weather), cleaning bathrooms and putting food back that the customers didn't want. I didn't really learn much. The management was very mean and not understanding. The hardest part of the job was everything. The most enjoyable part of the job was payday (sometimes)."
Safeway,1bh0spssvb8bmbjj,3.0,"Some stores are worse than others but in my experience, this company doesn't really value their employees. Their management staff doesn't lead their employees properly leading to a dysfunctional team. This job taught me that not every employer work alongside their employees and that you can spend all your time working your butt off but they will still only see the fact that you showed up 1 minute late that one time."
Safeway,1bh0oe1d2b85885p,4.0,"This place is all about learning customer service. I can't say they do a perfect job of teaching individuals how to change their attitudes, but the tools are all there from training to experience with customers and Safeway definitely gets people from all walks of life."
Safeway,1bh0nkd9hbrdeat7,3.0,"Safeway is a grocery store. Working for Safeway is much like working for any other grocery store. Compensation was competitive. Employees are at times stretched thin, and overworked."
Safeway,1bh0kphhvas1r90n,1.0,"When you leave a grocery store you tend to miss the coworkers more than the customers. I do not miss the stress or the problems associated with the store, I do miss my coworkers though."
Safeway,1bh0cov8kb81badc,4.0,"Very fast paced job, never a real moment of down time. Great for multi-tasker types of people, good for those who like to meet a variety of customers."

Safeway,1bh008iepaqhh8uj,5.0,"Bagged groceries for customers, returned shopping carts from parking lot to store, provided outstanding customer service to shoppers, cleaned areas as necessary."
Safeway,1bgvpsg46b81b8vq,2.0,I have worked for Safeway for almost 13 years and this has to be the worse place I have ever worked.  All the employees talk bad about other employees and management treats employees horrible.
Safeway,1bguhqmvrak5iboo,3.0,"While this company does offer good benefits (due ONLY to the union workers belong to) and a fair opportunity to move up, management is trained to see only the bottom line.  A store manager once instructed me to leave dairy products (including eggs, yogurt, butter etc.) on the shelf after it sat unrefrigerated overnight.  Product was temping at 65 degrees.  I threatened to call the health department which is the only reason they let me throw it away.  This company is decent for short term work or if your ultimate goal is to move up into store management ASAP.  I had this job while I worked through college so that wasn't an option for me."
Safeway,1bguc4mqvas1pe7c,3.0,"I was hired on as a Deli Clerk to which I would start work at 4:30 in the morning 5 days a week. I was taught how to do everything there, however, they throw you into it after only about 3 days of training and expect you to know everything. Management was pretty good, they made work more fun. Though the hardest part was just all the running around and the stress to get through all the customers as quick as possible so that you can attempt to finish your daily tasks."
Safeway,1bgu2unlmb815cuu,2.0,Loved the work hated the people. Treated the employees like slaves. Threatened your job if you had to call in sick or needed a day off for anything. No job security at all
Safeway,1bgtvjbskb8bh992,5.0,i was trained in safeway after got done with clover park technical college program. then got hired as a floater technician there and traveled to safeway pharmacies around tacoma
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bgtqf5pnb815alk,4.0,"I enjoyed my work as a pharmacy technician at Safeway, because it was fairly straight forward and simple. The worst was talking to insurance companies and angry patients."
Safeway,1bgs7ok2kb815est,5.0,I worked there for 5 years in 2 different stores.  I was 18 and started as a bag boy and was promoted up really quick.  At the end of my 5 years i was the Frozen Manager in the Washougal store.  I had 5 different titles in my 5 years and I will never forget the time while i was at Safeway.
Safeway,1bgs1hjdvbrd7874,2.0,"typical day at work for me was coming in and doing what employees left of their assignments to do plus staying on top of my own. management was very poor, managers did not make female employees do their work instead assigned the guys to do their work. hardest part of the job was balancing m work and other given work that others wouldn't do. most enjoyable part was some employees that I stay in contact with."
Safeway,1bgrlus3j5nd58vl,4.0,Friendly co-workers and balanced work environment. Management was typically fair. Work place culture was like a family and everyone helped each other out
Safeway,1bgr02ft7brd78u5,4.0,I learned how to be productive and how to minimize movements to boost productivity.  How to build loads to be shipping without hurting the contents.  How to use a motorized pallet jack.
Safeway,1bgqpmfleb8bhd4n,4.0,"Good company to work for...people overall are nice...wish it paid more money to its non-union employees...the company pays weekly...and they offer health, dental, 401k benefits"
Safeway,1bgplrfchas1k9ob,5.0,It a nice place to work for. But all i can say is without time invested you will not move up to fast. Management is a hit or miss but its union will have your back on that.
Safeway,1bgpgkbhjakd693g,3.0,"Although many managers were decent and quite good, many were quite bad and would verbally threaten the jobs of employees and show favoritism, and fair treatment, to those that sucked up to them. Further the corporate culture seemed to favor those managers for advancement. This often lead to other employees having to do more work and getting more of the blame if things went wrong."
Safeway,1bgpgcf0ibrd38qq,4.0,"Worked as a bagger clerk for a little over a year until I became a checker/cashier. This was my high school job, really no complaints, too young to know any different. Very easy job."
Safeway,1bgpdsschb84ufi7,3.0,Unstable working environment. Not the experience one is looking for to further a career.  Lots of sudden changes which makes it uncomfortable and nearly impossible to adapt to your roll.
Safeway,1bgp9ag7sb810fu3,2.0,"They, like most companies have strayed from the ideals they were founded on, now with more inclination to satisfy shareholders than the well being of their employees, you'll find me looking elsewhere and not looking back"
Safeway,1bgp4lnbuak9fcml,5.0,Working for Safeway has been fun and challenging being a APC all purpose clerk make me realise how the store works around with the groceries ordering and many thinks more
Safeway,1bgp3bjhlak5cfvd,4.0,"i had a bad fallout with one of the managers, she was new and didn""t like my work habits i guess i don't know very well because she was just yelling at everything i did and i couldn't take it i had built a report with the main manager but i just couldn't handle her however safeway did say that i was rehirable."
Safeway,1bgoalsbd52t1bv1,3.0,"I love working there, but management was terrible. They treat you like a slave, they didn't show that they cared about the employees.I don't regret working there because I have a little experience now.\"
Safeway,1bgo2qck8akh79ga,4.0,"Being comparitively inexperienced, I learned a lot of new things here. All my collleagues helped and supported me a lot in exploring and learning new concepts."
Safeway,1bgne1dsnak9fek4,4.0,"Very good company to work for...they even sent me to blow molding school to refine my troubleshooting skills...lots of overtime  because of people calling off...spent many Friday and Saturday nights covering for my union brothers. Lots of rebuild time on the weekends...welded in a heat exchanger/ 14 hours until the job was done...had to be ready Monday morning for production to run. My positive attitude ...""can do""helped a lot on this job!"
Safeway,1bgn453oh52t1et4,3.0,"Working at Safeway has taught me a lot of life lessons: not being afraid of hard work, being able to handle stressful situations, and learning how to greet people and problem solve. But they do not value their employees at all. Management only cares about making money, they don't care about their disabled employees or their employees who have been working for their company for over 10 years. I value treating people with respect and having a positive working environment, however Safeway fell short of this."
Safeway,1bgn2m4c2b810ev9,4.0,Great job if you like people and customer service.  There are many positions available in all stores so you never get bored doing the same old thing.  Advancement and training is always available.
Safeway,1bgmerrglak5cegj,4.0,A typical day working at Safeway is demanding. If not enough courtesy clerks so up you do the work of five men this is much more common than you would expect.
Safeway,1bgm8ei8tb84ueu1,3.0,"If you want to work irregular work hours and suffer through endless rude customers, then Safeway is the place for you. But they do have pretty good benefits if you are a full time employee"

Safeway,1bglsoo99ak9fdbb,4.0,It was a good job it is just that i did or could not make as much as i  wanted.it always felt like there was never enough time to complete your tasks.
Safeway,1bgl9o7itbrcvcav,2.0,I did no get the chance to do anything else but stay at 1 register all day and sell and  bag groceries.
Safeway,1bgkfkdiias1ke5a,2.0,"I had to go our and retrieve carts, as well as put them away neatly back in their holders. Also, I had to make sure that the customers were all content with their shopping as well as having all of their questions answered"
Safeway,1bgkcoukgb84u8v7,5.0,"I LOVED my job at safeway. Weekly pay, amazing benefits, awesome people. Training was mainly done on the computer which didn't really help for when they threw you on the actual thing. I only had one issue. When it comes to last minute family emergencies management got upset with me and my brother was in the hospital with SERIOUS injuries and they said if I didn't work or get someone to work for me they'd fire me. AND they told other coworkers that too."
Safeway,1bgk5m3rrb8b78ib,4.0,"Overall was a good job. However the constant hours with just minimal experience and really early workouts was very fast paced for me to get used to. Whenever I started feeling like I was doing better, the other employees made me feel bad about how I was doing with my work experience."
Safeway,1bgk551gjb8109p3,3.0,I can't say that Safeway was a very enjoyable place to work for me. I am an introvert at heart and being in customer service is not my strong suit. I was only a cashier so my duties consisted of helping customers checkout items picked up in the store.
Safeway,1bgk345h6b810fs8,3.0,"Too low of pay to bother unless you are in high school. If you like getting cheaper food from the deli and you really like eating food from the Safeway deli, go for it."

Safeway,1bgioc28bbrcvbqg,5.0,Co-workers are all friendly in the store. The management team is very helpful to co-workers and customers. The hardest part is the rush hour because the line overflows
Safeway,1bghmj0jbb8108cc,3.0,"It is difficult to match the pay with most other retail management positions. Store Manager positions vary from 75k - 105k depending on experience, etc... Culture is somewhat negative and very high stress. Hours are not very flexible."
Safeway,1bgh15bts5n8v8c7,5.0,"Safeway was a great company got along with other workers and managers, and you always had a great connection with all of the customers also I would highly recommend this job"
Safeway,1bggvd8bfb8108e8,4.0,-Can get crazy depending on the department you are in
Safeway,1bgghdk1eb8b7f9i,4.0,Great place to work if you enjoy a fast paced work environment. Expect to be held accountable for not getting everything done that you are supposed to in a day.

Safeway,1bgetq4s2akd6da8,4.0,It was a good place to work but at the same time it was consistently understaffed. Management was fair and people were friendly. I realize that they had to cut hours for a reason but being the only courtesy clerk on call meant some of my responsibilities weren't always fully attended to.
Safeway,1bgen6t5u52t1agk,3.0,"Safeway is the second largest grocery retail in the US.  Eastern division operates roughly 120 stores in MD,  VA, DC, and DE.

However, my new manager had told me, the last day I had worked (almost a full week ago now) that she would call me when she got my schedule figured out. I have heard no word, the online schedule has not been updated, and I can't seem to get in contact with her."
Safeway,1bgegddrhb8b7al2,4.0,I liked the work and was okay with the pay. However the hours I received weren't good for any sort of long term work. I am leaving after a year here because this job just can't cover my bills when I get less than 15-20 hours a week usually.
Safeway,1bgedf98bas1gd64,5.0,Typical day at work is dealing with a lot of different personalities and cultures.  Store are busy but are kept clean and safe.  Good environment to work in.  Very professional  the hardest part of the job is not becoming complacent because you perform the same function over and over with little change from day to day.  the work life balance is good.
Safeway,1bgece3lkb810c69,4.0,This is a great company to work for. A typical day would be bagging groceries and going outside to push carts. I learned a lot of patience while I worked at Safeway. The workplace culture is great. The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with the heat in the summer time. The most enjoyable part was interacting with customers and having conversations with other employee's when your not busy.

Safeway,1bgc5uilraqh6ea9,4.0,"Its a very chill job, good first job. Seems to suck people in and many of the workers there tell you how they got stuck there so go to school. Sometimes customers are very picky but depends on location."
Safeway,1bgbv62l4brcscnd,3.0,"Customers are easy to help and work can become fun at times, however there is heavy favoritism and at times a disregard for seniority. Hardest part of the job is moving as fast as you can to get the job done because Safeway is afraid of overtime. Best part of the job is the always friendly coworkers, as well as many friendly and interesting customers."
Safeway,1bgbm56qvb80p9jd,3.0,It was a hard job.
Safeway,1bgblbf4mb84pbgp,3.0,Good place to work if you are willing to pay your dues...literally. They will schedule you the absolute minimum hours possible but expect you to work off the clock to get you job done.....

Safeway,1bg9qdgvhb80jaa7,3.0,"I worked as a courtesy clerk for Vons for a year. The work environment is usually fast-paced. Soft skills are helpful, but not required. The management was pretty good most of the time. Overall, not a bad place to work."
Safeway,1bg9p3gpeb84j9v6,4.0,Easy work. Only problem being a lack of management knowledge on how the store actually runs. Feels like random people thrown into management sometimes.
Safeway,1bg9lii0hb84je2q,3.0,"Safeway is one of the easiest companies to get hired by, but that is because so many employees have quit."
Safeway,1bg9inndvb80j9b6,3.0,its a good company to work for need to train management more and give more hours the employs are friendly and a joy to work with I would recommend and enjoy would working here again
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.

Safeway,1bg99e2geak94e2t,5.0,Good part time job to have as extra income. My Typical day would start at 4am. Setting up the kiosk in time for customers in 30 min. Greeting my regular customers was fun.
Safeway,1bg98tvu4aqgub01,1.0,"They only care about the business, instead of the people conducting the business. Low staff, barely breaks or lunches. They wrongfully terminate and create hostile work environments."
Safeway,1bg96qdnlb8aodd3,5.0,Management and crew made work here much more enjoyable. If time is managed properly it is a very rewarding work place. Be ready to work outside retrieving carts. This can be challenging if you live in an area that gets particularly hot.
Safeway,1bg7j35aob84ja7d,4.0,"First job in pharmacy. Management always encouraging, willing to help out. Learned a lot."
Safeway,1bg7g15h6b84je3h,3.0,Nice job to have.... I would recommend... They are a union... So if you like union jobs than I am sure you will like this one as well... nice place to
Safeway,1bg7ahh8oak94drl,3.0,With Safeway being a union office a lot of the time the rate of pay wasn't necessarily fair because there were no merit raises. So no matter how much harder you worked than your co-worker everyone still received the same rate of pay.
Safeway,1bg73biocb8aobov,4.0,"You tend to enjoy a job when the worst part of the job is the hot weather outside. Safeway has had some of the nicest fellow employees one could work with, reasonable wages with very flexible work schedules. However, just from personal experience, you may end up working rather late or at the crack of dawn. Again, just from personal experience. There are also some duties they'll ask you to do that training exercises won't prepare you for, which can be glaring for the first time, but you get into the swing of things fairly quickly."
Safeway,1bg702ikhbrcma6q,4.0,"Worked in kiosk of gas station, was a pretty good environment. Also worked in the store when it was busy. They have a good union and benefits. Lots of culture."
Safeway,1bg701d0rb80jad7,2.0,A typical day would be seeing your favorite customers and friends and putting a smile and there faces.. You start to learn alot about your coworker and customer. I love working for the company before we got new management they do not care about your situation outside of they company it like they only want to make there bonuses and could careless about the underdogs who do the most and best for the company. The hardest part of the job is not being able to meet the customer satisfaction and the most enjoyable part was seeing all the same smiling face of customer over the years
Safeway,1bg6vafs4b80jbeo,4.0,"Fast paced, detail oriented atmosphere.  Take care of company guidelines and you will be fine.   Great chance for growth within the company. Will work a lot of holidays and weekends."
Safeway,1bg6mpr5vb8aoe7h,2.0,"During my time at Safeway, it was painfuly obvious to me that the common worker was the lowest priority for the store, with pay being locked at minimum wage ( even for those with experience in their field) and advancement being a rare occurence."
Safeway,1bg6aq9t6b84jbf3,4.0,The work day can either be really easy or really tough. Customers can be demanding but I stayed at this company for 5 years just because of those I worked with. Everyone was friendly and treated each other like a close friend or family and that helps a lot when you're working a day that seems like everything that could go wrong will go wrong.
Safeway,1bg4vfd1r52spf77,3.0,"People were rude, the hours sucked sometimes, always drama and somebody stealing. The environment itself was dangerous traveling to and from work. I enjoyed it at first but I began to hate it later."
Safeway,1bg4r91cnb80jbff,3.0,"stressful work environment, not enough hours to go around, managers only cared for survey results and nothing else.  Paid minimum wage for most of my time there with minimal advancement in job title or pay scale.  I could personally run each department by myself, yet i made the same as the newest clerks."
Safeway,1bg4q3eemb80jaco,3.0,This was my first job. Got hired as Courtesy worked it for about a week or two then promoted to be a cashier. then promoted to be a night crew lead.
Safeway,1bg252gu1b80jarn,4.0,"You will work every single second of every day that you are scheduled. It was very busy most of the time, and neither customers nor management are very appreciative of the work you do. There is never enough time in a work day to get done everything that needs to be done."
Safeway,1bg10p98db84j8rd,4.0,"Great job for someone in college, seeing that you can only start off part-time and it pays 15 an hour."
Safeway,1bfvs86d0brcmc7c,4.0,Management is often under stress and may tend to operate in ways inefficient to the company and or employees affected. Poor scheduling and pay discrepancies have been an issue for many including myself.
Safeway,1bfvom8p6b80jb5f,3.0,I really enjoyed this job. The only reason I left was because a lady I was working with slapped me in the face twice & was not even written up. Didn't feel respected after that.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bfvhv0bob8aoa00,4.0,"At safeway you learn to operate more than one department. I would be working all day in the parking lot rounding up shopping carts, then get asked to come help with bagging. I advanced to become a produce clerk within months. Great place to seek advancement and higher paying positions."
Safeway,1bfv9tp0kakcu8ps,4.0,i enjoyed working for Safeway. i spent 5 years there and i moved up the line pretty quickly. Safeway is all about customer service and is very people oriented.
Safeway,1bfv1on0oak52bij,4.0,"You're able to set your own hours and request days off 2 weeks in advance, so makes for nice work/ life balance. PIC or lead may change schedule any time after schedule is posted, so be aware to check it frequently. You may get called in at a few hours notice or can decide to swap hours with another employee if approved by manager with advance notice."
Safeway,1bfuvols8brcma4q,3.0,"Customer service was primary, work place sanitation was also high on the priority list. A typical day would involve product packaging, for our store and satellite stores. Stocking shelves with fresh product paying attention to organization and sanitation of the shelves and bakery cases. Assisting customers with placing cake orders guiding them to the best choice to make their occasion special and unique. I learned how to better communicate with various age groups. That being said management lacked in communication. Making the job difficult when supplies ran low or out. I enjoyed seeing the customers smile when i presented them with the cake they ordered. It made my day knowing they were pleased and i helped make there occasion special."
Safeway,1bftet8i6b8ao813,2.0,"Safeway can be very stressful for a number of reasons that cannot be easily explained in this format. It is a good starting job, they will train you, as long as your willing and able, to do pretty much anything in the store, making you more valuable and flexible to the store. A lot of store managers start out as Courtesy Clerks and rise through the ranks.There a constant struggle of needing help and quality help at that.  If you know someone that works at a Safeway, talk to them about it, it can be a miserable place sometimes so  feel it out. You may like it and make it work but just be careful with getting stuck there, you may regret it later."
Safeway,1bfsv0ugv1d0u57k,2.0,"I've met some awesome co workers and we all have such a great time. Albertsons took over Safeway and is running their stores to the ground. Corporate expects too much done with so little help. None of the management is happy and all run around like wild, angry chickens with their heads cut off. Its ashamed."
Safeway,1bfsk89qe1d0e78q,3.0,"Courtery Clerk Sweep and clean bathrooms,desks,and trash out, Also Put food into stocks, dispatcher groceries and sort groceries and push carts into store"
Safeway,1bfse5vtv1d0e1iu,3.0,Safeway is a well known grocery store and will almost have you be busy. Management unfortunately had favorites and it showed with what they would let some employees get away with but not others. Connecting with the customers and havig them become your regulars was a great feeling.
Safeway,1bfqqqeqlaqgnds8,4.0,"Although I met some very nice people and made some good money, I found the job to be very stressful and at other times, boring. Being a cashier is a lot more difficult then it looks. I would only take this job again if I was desperate for money."
Safeway,1bfqm96lr1d091p4,2.0,"Terrible, incompetent management trickles down, and without that, it can quickly turn into a chaotic, hostile environment. The job wasn't necessarily, but it was demeaning and soul-crushing. The only reason to stick around is for the chance to be promoted, but that carrot can only be dangled in front for so long. The best part is all based on chance, and that's co-workers. Unfortunately, I had to deal with a lot of hostile and unfriendly ones, or some that were even unwilling to work. What I learned was the basic operation entailed in the job(pump and till operations, customer service), and I learned them quick. Past that point it was really a test of how much the managers could shirk off onto me and see how long I'd last before I'd crumple."
Safeway,1bfq68t03aqgnd1a,5.0,Working At Safeway I Have Gained A Positive Attitude /Enthusiasm. Great Customer Service Skills Plus I am able to multitask  Got Better At My Cash  Register Skills
Safeway,1bfq3j0971fdv6m3,5.0,Working as a Produce Gm (General Merchandiser) was a fun position to have. It allowed me to assist customers in selecting products that they can be satisfied with. Being able to see them leave with a smile on their face and polite thank you as they left was all I really needed. Some customers would enjoy my positive attitude so much that they would even stop to make conversation with me just so that they could have a few more moments of company. Surely during the busy times it would become a bit busy so work will be double. Though all and all in truth I would say Vons was a nice place to work.
Safeway,1bfpksn29aqgn9uv,2.0,typical  workday:8hr work day
Safeway,1bfo9opgjakgpbul,4.0,Not a bad place if you need a job. Spent all day in back cutting fruit so not much change. Great time management skills are easy to pick up. Management doesn't mess with you much
Safeway,1bfo8l6121d0p289,2.0,"Really changed since Safeway acquired by Albertsons.  Took away employee association/benefits (employee fundraisers, discount tickets to sporting events, movies, etc.) that made you feel part of a family, not anymore.  If looking to move up, management plays favorites to certain clique, regardless of experience.  Once you go above and beyond as a hard worker you will be taken advantage of.  Benefits are okay, noticing slowly being taken away.  The job (work) itself is great, get ready to learn a lot and meet many wonderful people within organization and externally."
Safeway,1bfnr5ui0ak8udhu,4.0,I like to work here because its a good way to keep me busy.  I can affored my needs and keep me on a good foot. I think I need a little more time and payments to be a great job

Safeway,1bfmqc9l71fds5s4,4.0,Its a great place to work if you have the right people who understand your situation. I have been blessed with the people Ive worked with for the last couple years.  All I can say is be open and honest with your management team and they will do their best to work with you as much as possible.
Safeway,1bflq8nvd0mtq0iq,4.0,"Staff and management is amazing to work with. If you are willing to stand for a long period of time and have the patience to deal with extremely rude customers, you will be fine."

Safeway,1bfki7cps0mt9466,4.0,"Friendly place to work, learn good skills.  Learned new checkout register system, learned front desk management, managers were cool, customers usually friendly unless they thought they didn't get a sale, but then I could ask the manager to deal with it."
Safeway,1bfkgfufg1d0j4kt,4.0,"While it's rare for those with professional aspirations to stay in retail, it certainly makes for a great place to start as a young person getting involved in the workforce. Safeway is a company that I would recommend to someone getting their start young with, as they are fair but realistic in their treatment of their employees, and there is indeed early forms of advancement that rewards effort and ingenuity. The work is not complicated overall, but there is a rewarding increase in difficulty as one's position rises."
Safeway,1bfkbbshp1d036bd,2.0,Safeway has a poor work environment. Not one person truly wanted to be there and make a difference. I always heard the employees talking  bad about customers and their job.
Safeway,1bfka8hcm1d0j3am,4.0,"Working at Safeway you must be a lot of things, but efficient is the one thing stands above the rest. As a union worker you are expected to work fast and hard daily."
Safeway,1bfj5g0bpaqgh9g4,3.0,"I as a night stocker for a summer. We worked anytime 7pm to about 8pm. Working during the night time was tough. We were asked to be quick with our stocking. Once a person memorized the isles of where products went, this job wasn't hard. There was only four of us. I was the youngest one by far. My co workers were anywhere from 30 years old to almost 60 years old. I'm just in my 20s. Even though there was a age difference I was able to get along with all my coworkers."
Safeway,1bfitpl2e1d133t0,2.0,I was typically working by myself. I was a AM baker I would get in early and it was a lot of work on me for one employee. I feel like it should had been two bakers in the morning. It was hard to understand my co worker because a lot of them didn't understand English every well. It was a hassle to work the for the little bit of pay I was receiving.
Safeway,1bfit7npn0mtq35v,3.0,"The tasks of the jobs of clerk are simple but very physically demanding. There is rarely ever down-time. There are always different tasks that need to be done. Expectations are high from management to fill the bakery with products and not leave holes in displays. I've learned strategy, time management skills, new bakery skills from other positions such as baker's assistant, cake decorator, and bakery manager. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting along with my coworkers. However, satisfied customers who greet you and thank you also make the job better."
Safeway,1bfhi40uoakgke7k,3.0,Everyone have the same mind frame which is getting the job done before the end of the day. Everyone thought of safety while driving the pallet jacks on the floor.
Safeway,1bfg7uk2f0mt93rp,4.0,A typical day as a courtesy clerk mainly consist of maintaining a clean work space. I've learned how to manage my time. The hardest part of the job is being called for assistance while trying to complete a task.

Safeway,1bfd50aocak4mbc3,5.0,"This job really kept me busy with the amount of hours they give me. There were pretty lenient with giving you the days off that you need. I ended up working there for almost 3 years and I had a weeks paid vacation for working a year. This job gave me skills to work customer service, floral, produce, pharmacy, check stand, and of course curtesy clerk. I developed a lot different skills from working at one company."

Safeway,1bf9vs21m1fdl3f3,1.0,The managers did not look out for their employees. They threw you into the job without any proper training and expected you to hold up your position to the best expectations when you yourself are trying to figure out how things are done because of lack of training.

Safeway,1bf67uja8ak8m94r,2.0,"I've held a variety of positions and this has got to be the worst one yet. The compensation is very low for the amount of responsibility, detail, and stress involved. There is a shortage of staff with processing delays and the company is only concerned about their sales dollars rather than employee appreciation or customer service. Many customers are unnecessarily cranky (to put it nicely), there isn't enough time given for proper training, and management talks about shortcomings of staff to other staff."

Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1berecir11d025ap,5.0,Meat cutting is a fun job. Learning all aspects of cutting all kinds of meat. It is a fast pace environment which I liked. Working with the public is fun and getting them exactly what they. working with others made the job fun.
Safeway,1berblh9b1d1215t,2.0,"All it takes is one busy day at Safeway to see it can get pretty hectic. On the weekends or normally after 3 pm, the store can get insanely busy. But thanks to that I developed my customer service skills over the years and its helped me interact with people a lot better. Sometimes we were understaffed and overworked. The employees in my store were amazing with a few exceptions. Management was horrible though. Bosses didn't genuinely care for employees, they had favorites and it became so bad that I lost interest in working for them. The hardest part was definitely dealing with the managers. The most enjoyable part was the flexible schedule (when they actually gave you the schedule you ask for.)"

Safeway,1bep2drep0mcn22g,2.0,everything is done by seniority. there is room for advancement and growth. no set hours or schedule. the management is not to helpful and at times are only worried ab out their bonuses
Safeway,1bep0ii0nb87kfov,3.0,Safeway was a good experience for me when I was in high school. I enjoyed earning money but I didn't feel motivated at all. My motivation was to work harder than anyone else so I could get 40 hours a week.
Safeway,1beott1s5brfbbk4,3.0,clock into work with a identification number and went to produce to stock the shelves. management was helpful. the hardest part of the day was trying to help everyone out at once who needed produce and when you didnt have it in stock it was the end of the world for the buyer. the best part of the job is your employees.
Safeway,1beosq5khb8bdc9d,3.0,I loved working there.  I love people and getting to know all of them.  Managers were very unfair and biass at times. It is very fast pace and you must be ready for anything.
Safeway,1beoskcff1aht6lk,2.0,"The place is very dirty. And the pay is so low that you'd have to work 100 hours a week to be able to afford anything at all. All you do is stand there for hours and don't get adequate breaks. No one cares about anyone there, and all the people are snobby."
Safeway,1beopp48jb8bdaja,3.0,"this job was very stressful,hours very from day to day. production numbers didn't matter because you always have to do more. working there you didn't make enough money to live ."

Safeway,1benomghgakgidf2,2.0,"I didn't really feel like my position as a courtesy clerk at safeway had all that much upward momentum, but it was a paycheck. Super easy job. Pushing carts, putting stuff back on the shelf. Stressful hours though. Always random. Don't expect people to respect you."
Safeway,1ben7iqggb83k89e,2.0,"Employees can sum it up to you with a one word pun: ""slaveway""... No one could ever get paid enough for the things employees have to deal with at safeway..."
Safeway,1ben6os5gb8bdcto,1.0,"I worked at the same location for the better part of a decade and all I came away with was that not only does corporate not care about the employees, but the management will outright tell you to quit if you don't like it. No matter how far in advance you apply for vacations they will cancel even approved time off."
Safeway,1bemtp5ctb83cdci,4.0,Enjoyed interaction with customers and being able to help customer. Didn't like Union or hours given to me. Altogether had trouble providing for my family.
Safeway,1bemb3o5ab83c9l0,3.0,"Standard grocery environment of the day. Can be stressful and very demanding. Local and regional supervisors are at constant odds in regards to how they want things done; one says this...another says that. Changes are constant and ongoing. If you understand what it means to work ""with great urgency"", then you will thrive in this environment."

Safeway,1bem3mmmeb83cfea,4.0,A typical day at work is you go clock into the system. You head back too your where the items you sell on the shelf and see which one you need to start cutting up first(either vegetables or fruits) to make sure the shelves are never empty of items. After you figure out what you need to start working on you go back to your work space and start working. Pretty soon you end up realizing that your work day is done and head home.

Safeway,1bejb7debb87ccef,4.0,"No day is really average, sometimes busy, sometimes slow. Can be asked to help in other departments. Besides food clerk I am the safety champion, I was taught how to work the liquor department and GM department. Management is ok, through your career you can report to different management and some you will not be too fond of. The hardest thing is when we do not have enough food clerk staff and customers complain about the wait time to check out. When you get the right staff working together who communicate and help each other out is the best and you are helping to be there."

Safeway,1beh7lhrub8b1dqe,4.0,The things that are the bad part is you dont have set schedule and you can be working from 3 to 1130 and come back at 7 quiet often. Also management aren't the best at managing.

Safeway,1begrv39f1ah3797,3.0,"This job was my most enjoyable one after leaving the military. Management was awesome, unless you got on the bad side of it. I learned my best customer service qualities here. The hardest part is trying to remember what needs to get done for the day, because each day is different in its own way. The most enjoyable is seeing regular customers daily and making it worth the long hours."
Safeway,1begqbdpr1ba33k2,1.0,"horrible place to work, they""ll  expect a lot of work done in the 3 hours they give you for the whole week they want you to kiss their butt  and beg them for hours everyone talks about each other they start stuff between the workers because they think that that well make them work harder if they don't like each other the managers dont set a good example they dont lead by example  they talk on there phones whlie interrupting workers while they work,  my managers don't come to work in professional work attire, they treat courtesy clerks like anything , the managers lie and harass  their employees, and they got crazy rules that they dont follow themselves you'll get  fired if you buy some thing before your break and you'll get fired if your late coming back from your break but they do it all the time plus they got favorites  so that dont stop some  workers from doing it plus they'll write you up for  just about anything so dont blink or breath  they'll also assume that you aint doing anything even if you are they'll watch you on camera helping customers then tell you aint doing noting but talking mind you that one of their main rules is customers come first  my manager told me that they can find items themselves its a whole lot more pettyness that go's on in safeway but im a just stop here good luck"

Safeway,1bee755ofb8b19mc,5.0,A typical day at work consisted of printing out prescriptions and filling them. Maintaining stock and organizing workplace and medicine cabinets. I took some phone calls and learned the computer system. The management was very friendly and extremely willing to teach. They were fun and very professional. The hardest part of the job was learning their computer system in the pharmacy. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping management get tasks completed and extending friendly customer service to others.
Safeway,1becq8lufb8369kk,3.0,Safeway was a great company 23 years ago they paid well and they took care of their employees ! Slowly over the years they started trying to fire everyone that was full-time ! I did learn a lot at Safeway about the meat department ! However the management was always horrible !! A typical day at work would be complete harassment ! The hardest part of the job was dealing with management the best part of the job was dealing with my customers !!

Safeway,1be9obnd31bg346q,1.0,Only work for this company as an absolute last last last resort. Several years of cuts have resulted in higher prices and longer lines with an ALL time low in employee moral.
Safeway,1be9g1ffcb8b1cdm,5.0,I didn't really enjoy Safeway but I got the job done and that's all that really matters . But I just didn't like they way they treated me personally. But overall Safeway was a good job to have

Safeway,1be6iq3lb52uadgs,3.0,It's pretty much what you might expect of working any register job. There's room for advancement with the individuals who are charismatic and run the extra mile to please their boss. There's also room for job training in the other departments for individuals who are bold enough to ask the other managers for a chance at training.
Safeway,1be6d6nn1bretfk1,5.0,"great if you have no other options or retirement job. not a great career. If you have the aptitude you will rise to a higher position. people friendly environment, helps to have a desire for detail."
Safeway,1be4s8prhb8aoae8,3.0,"Safeway is a fast paced environment that pays minimum wage. Most people do not enjoy working there, however it is fairly easy to get a job with them. If your in desperate need they are a good route to take, just don't get stuck there."

Safeway,1be4it0icbremb46,4.0,safeway was a great workplace but management at that store was not very well set up i guess you could say. it was productive and stuff got done but it was a little chaos like.
Safeway,1be4efgciakaeeu8,1.0,No set schedule. Had to hop around to all departments. Seasonal wage. Had to pay union that did nothing to stand up for rights at workplace. Only ever conceded. Management weren't organized or educated. Only positions that were full time were department managers and they were probably the worst workers. Everything else was considered part time. Union only cared about full time employees. No chance to move up at all.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.

Safeway,1be3oj25cb86ubp9,4.0,"On a typical day at work, I would help with the cutting and grinding of meat products for customer purchase. I learned a lot about the anatomy of cattle, pig, and chicken I never knew before. I learned about a variety of cuts of meat and how best to prepare them. My experience with my manager was great, but the higher up the chain of command, the pressure was brought down on us to get more sales. I enjoyed my coworkers a lot and the health benefits were great."
Safeway,1be3norheaqi0dka,5.0,A typical day consisted of performing my required tasks as well as adapting to the ever changing events/situations that occur while while working the public.

Safeway,1be3gilhqbrem8n3,4.0,I bagged grocery's and worked in the deli I learned how to be a team-member my store was very busy but I loved the fast work jobs. I believe I did well because I moved up and had more response ability I open the deli some mornings.
Safeway,1be3dt4ngak6bfc9,2.0,"I worked at Safeway for less than a year, in that time I was able to work my way into becoming one of the bookeepers. Although I enjoyed my job, It is retail work, therefore you have to have an open schedule to get good hours. I felt the pay was low and the benefits weren't that great. There are really no incentives and if there are, you don't make enough to utilize them, who can go to Disneyland on minimum wage? Overall, I am grateful they hired me, they helped me get back into the workforce."
Safeway,1be3bvmfi52u5ftl,5.0,Good place to work with great benefits at the corporate level. Job requires to much travel. Expectations for Manager performance is unrealistic and unsupported.
Safeway,1be382e8j5j61afb,5.0,"Never had a problem here. My bosses are always nice. If i call out sick they dont give me a hard time, extra pay on sundays, you can earn paid vacation based on hours worked, raises are also based on hours worked. Uniform isnt the best but i can deal with that."
Safeway,1be2fkqc8brem93g,3.0,"You learn a lot very quickly working here, as a baker I got the full 40 hours usually. Although they list almost everyone as part time so they can cut your hours a TON if they feel like it, which they do sometimes. Overall, I dont regret working here and am sad to leave because Ive met some awesome people here,  but management is so unresponsive. I've asked to be scheduled day time only for years and they just do not care, they scheduled me working back to back shifts with less than 8 hours between on a regular basis. Employees are treated as disposable despite doing an awesome job. I see coworkers being treated just as poorly and it makes me angry to see this company just casually using people up without even trying to treat them decently. The pay is decent, and it gives you great experience and time management skills, but I just cant reccomend it as a long term job.... at least not the Bakery department... it seems like the harder you try to improve things the more they just take advantage of you. Being treated so poorly and having your concerns dismissed without a thought can really demoralize a person.  The work was great, and I liked helping the customers... but the schedule was intolerable, they went so far as to tell me that I was not *allowed* to ask for a normal schedule!"
Safeway,1be2b2m1ob86uar7,4.0,"typical day at work is like any other supermarket it has its moments where its slow and some days where its busy. i didnt learn much at the job it was pretty standard like retail. Management was not that good, always looked out for them selves and never really knew what was going on at the store."
Safeway,1be27ss2lak6b9uf,5.0,It was a very challenging position that kept you on your feet. Offered multiple opportunities for growth. The managers as well as employees were very friendly.

Safeway,1be132bmnbremfs8,2.0,"Not great....boring work. when you try to do more than you're assigned, you get yelled at. If you have nothing to do, you get yelled at. If you have too much tasks, you will get yelled at. they basically yell at you for almost anything."

Safeway,1be0m6hd5ak6bd4d,2.0,"Management was poor when I worked there. All low-level employees are in the union, so working your tail off is somewhat pointless. Not that I thrive off of recognition, but positive reinforcement after quality work is nice once in a while."
Safeway,1bdvmvudbbre4b3v,4.0,"is a great place to work and also has great benefits and an awesome environment would refer anyone to come and work for them. a typical day would inquire you setting up the deli, getting foods started and staying on the right pace"

Safeway,1bdqp6oc8bre4b9r,4.0,"Minors are able to get a job and gain skills to be employable elsewhere. It is easy to advance within the store if you are motivated and a hard worker. One of the most difficult tasks is dealing with the ever changing moods of the public, while always being courteous. This is a valuable tool to learn, that will be used throughout life."
Safeway,1bdprn79vb86c96r,3.0,good company til joined with albertson all i can say all i can say i do not think that good benefits. it is unfair when it comes to Human Resources as they come down go off on you if someone said something even not true
Safeway,1bdnm0rk4b82aeoe,4.0,"Expectations and standards are high. Extremely strict labor budgets and union contracts keep management's hands tied. That being said, the job is what you make it and there are lots of opportunities for advancement for those with the drive."
Safeway,1bdnffvc8b86cc1i,4.0,Clean the meat case while doing markdowns. Put the service meat case in. Run racks of back stock then work out back stock in shelves. Help other departments break down the daily load. Work my portion or the daily load all while helping costumers.

Safeway,1bdm1pu98as1pdqq,3.0,"the typical work day is stressful, you dont learn much as a courtesy clerk and the management team is unprofessional . the work place culture is relaxed and friendly enough, but also unprofessional and do not take care of customers adequately. the hardest part of the  job is being micromanaged by some managers and not given enough help or time to finish long tasks they assigned. when brought to attention, it goes unaddressed, as well as you have no job security. they hire and fire many people within a small time frame, you only have security if you have seniority.  the most enjoyable part of the job is the friendships you make with your coworkers."
Safeway,1bdl60oeab8a8c76,5.0,a day at work is fun you chat with customer with  thier shopping . Have your department in shape for manger to look at the work u accomplish  as well get an hour lunch

Safeway,1bdkisa1sak9ucfm,3.0,Nothing in particular is special about Safeway. It's a typical grocery store job filled with people who don't want to be working and where the managers are constantly breathing down your neck about something.
Safeway,1bdkgs6lr52tldfd,4.0,I worked night stalker and I enjoyed my work and the other employees there. I would go back to work for them any time.
Safeway,1bdkgmlft5n9m899,2.0,"If you want to be underappreciated by both management and customers, look no further than employment with Vons! They want to pay you the bare minimum and give you a ten cent raise every year.   Grocery stores use to take care of their employees and use to have amazing contracts with benefits, those days are long gone. Everyone working here looks visibly exhausted and miserable. Every coworker I had was constantly telling me of their financial struggles. On top of all that, this store is in a ""nicer"" neighborhood which means these pseudo-rich people think they own you and treat workers so disrespectfully. Management took the rich customer's side because they spend a lot of money in the store. Overall a very depressing and frustrating place to work.

Safeway,1bdfnfkfcbre48o5,1.0,"I absolutely loved the people. I looked forward to seeing my regular customers. The management are liars. They promoted me to PIC. So, I did the work of a PIC but did not get the pay. I was told to come for training and instead of training I was grilled by a very mean person from asset recovery over $9.60. It was a misunderstanding. I was suspended and fired a month later. I miss the customers."

The most enjoyable was being able to teach the safety first classes to different clinics."
Safeway,1bde2odjc8357cc1,2.0,"I worked in the deli, and we were constantly understaffed. It was a very chaotic environment, and there was never enough time in the day to complete the assigned work.

Safeway,1bddns5qfaqhedg7,2.0,"Schedule can be hectic and uncoordinated, as can duties change daily. But keeping a smile and going about your business helps the day run smoother.

There was just not any reason for me to continue there, as I could not survive on that pay."
Safeway,1bddfu6fgb89pdjt,3.0,Bakery was being able to get everything packaged and presented for customers.  Deli was making sure the food was hot and customers were helped in a timely manner.
Safeway,1bdd4821ob89p9au,1.0,"They expect you to learn everything in two weeks. Felt under constant pressure, I also felt as if they were holding a double standard for me because I'm (older). I was constantly under pressure to get ALL the carts in during my hour. Had to always go behind the younger ones and do their job since they didn't. They let me go just before I was to become a permanent employee, but they kept the younger people who have an umbilical cord tying them to their phone."
Safeway,1bdcrah68b85rf4b,3.0,"Pays well, with benefits.  Your pretty much always working if you have open availability.  Most stores are union now so thats a plus, but just like any other retail job, customer service is number one, so if you dont like people, it probably isnt the job for you."

Safeway,1bdcjeovoak5h9ca,3.0,At my particular store a typical day would be climbing a mountain. Lot of call ins and lack of caring. Seemed everyday was a battle to get to an operational stance. Just to come back in and do it all again the next day. Management was lackadaisical and never took disciplinary action to the ones who deserved it. The most enjoyable part was the customers. Always enjoyed helping them any way I could.

Safeway,1bdc0fhorak9lbn5,3.0,"A typically day was making  sure the line was short.The management there was very unorganized. Sometimes,the management can come off as being rude .

Safeway,1bd7lj8b7b85rfq3,3.0,I loved working at Safeway the people were great they are warm and very understanding. I was the key holder for ten registers and six departments. I also  handled payroll check cashing as well as western union sending and recaving  money. The manager however was the bad seed in the bunch and it made very hard to be there. I had to put my two weeks in due to the fact that he was the only one that treated me unfair.
Safeway,1bd5dsigab89pbdi,3.0,Safeway is a good place to work if you are just starting out as a teenager or need a summer job or need extra money for college. It is not a good job if you are looking to or are trying to grow or advance in the company as my experience with them has shown.

The work environment for Safeway was some what kind of hostile though, working for Safeway there is a lot of childish gossip in the work environment.

This was the first Starbucks I worked at and I had a few very good mentors to train me about the Starbucks culture. While the department management was excellent, the management of the store itself was not always as encouraging and friendly. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the yield of business we had while maintaining a clean and organized department. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friends I made while working there."

Lots of pharmacist turnover recently."

Safeway,1bcpre7psb89jad0,2.0,"Ive never been treated so unfairly by management in any other job but safeway. When an individual in the workplace feels scared, intimidated, or uncomfortable due to abuse or intimidation by a coworker, it creates what is called a hostile work environment. While any number of behaviors might create a hostile work environment, any conduct or actions that create an environment in which an employee dreads going to work is generally seen to create such a setting. A hostile work environment is sometimes referred to as an “offensive work environment,” or an “abusive work environment.” The individual causing a hostile work environment may be an employee, a supervisor, an owner, or even and independent contractor. There are federal and state laws in place to protect employees from being subjected to workplace hostility."

I learned how to be a courtesy clerk and to gain more experience in customers service. Unfortunately, I did not get a whole lot of hours because of management's decision due to new ownership. I heard there were good benefits but I did not get any because of being part time. I put my two-week notice in to move and seek better opportunity. I would say for a short term part time job I would recommend it but in terms of long-term opportunity I am not sure if it would be a good career due to new ownership!"

Safeway,1bc6c2emtb89f8k9,3.0,I enjoyed learning management skills and my mutli- tasking. It was a great learning experience and I refer this job to people who want to build their resume
Safeway,1bc4ivl37b89fd42,4.0,"It was a good place to work, my coworkers were nice, they included everyone, no judgement or gossip was thrown around and overall it was a wonderful first job opportunity. I quit because I needed more hours and a different schedule but I don't regret working there."
Safeway,1bc3tidanakd3a54,5.0,I really enjoyed this job since you do learn what goes on behind scenes for the Bakery. You get to learn that the bread is made from scratch and baked. People are very nice here and you get to help with decorating and stocking the desserts when needed.
Safeway,1bc3qfmubb85f93l,5.0,Convenient Parking...Superior Customer service...Shelves well stocked.Greeted with Friendly service while shopping..Management was awesome a lot of Team work and effort.
Safeway,1bc3p0b5das1cfo7,5.0,This company values the employees and is understanding of highschool students. I enjoyed my time here and never had an issue with scheduling. Was able to work as much or as little as I wanted.
Safeway,1bc3kg7qrb81fdp3,5.0,I have experienced nothing but the upmost respect and support in my work area. I love my staff and management!! We work in an extremely demanding and busy pharmacy but we all share the proper work flow and balance of assignments!
Safeway,1bc1lfn675n939os,4.0,I was in high school when i got hired here and i learned some much from the vets that i still apply it to my everyday work life made so friends and knew every single customer that walking in the store
Safeway,1bc16farkb89d9fj,3.0,"It really depends on what store you work at and who you work with on a daily basis. I had a boss who didn't care and it showed. I got a total of a dollar raise over the course of working there. Everyone expects new people to quit or not show up. Very low morale. Only the people who have been working there for 10+ years have any encouraging words to say, and they usually don't say them. If you work your tail off, you may eventually get into a department. But that isn't much better."
Safeway,1bc124ahbb81fdk7,5.0,"I had fun, it was a fun job surrounded by good people,and the opportunity to make people happy, I really loved this job,they gave me the hours I needed and were willing to work with me with NY class schedule."
Safeway,1bc10i4kv52t3c3s,4.0,"A typical courtesy clerk is a high school college age person. Our duties would be collecting carts, cleaning up messes, helping people to their cars and activities that follow that same suit. Not much room to advance to another position because when one becomes available they tend to hire from outside."
Safeway,1bc0rtqs6b85fci5,4.0,"Safeway was a great place to work,or so I hear, before they merged with Albertson's. I was employed during the transition period while the companies merged. There was a lot of chaos, and confusion, from the head office, down to the district and store management. This level of confusion with those in charge had a negative trickle down effect on the employees. I found the confusion frustrating and ridiculous."
Safeway,1bc0khpdhb81faqc,3.0,They were really in need of people so although I only wanted to work 24 hours a week because it was my first real job they scheduled me full time and it took a lot of hard work to clean and make food in the deli.
Safeway,1bc076fh552t3clv,3.0,"Got to work on time and do your job ,and your day will go by fast. It's a really good company to work for and it work with my  schedule as a person with  two jobs."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bbve89ghd051f9j,3.0,Es una gran empresa sin embargo en la época en la que me tocó trabajar estaba en crisis.
Safeway,1bbuqlmojaqgt97k,1.0,"Are you a masochist?  Have no self esteem?  Do you want to be chewed up and spat out?  Well, Safeway is the job for YOU.  We'll treat you like dirt and ask you to work even harder.  No amount of self-loathing and managerial disrespect is out of bounds."
Safeway,1bbuijd0fb81fa7p,4.0,Managing customer services and needs as well as associate performance.
Safeway,1bbue25r4b89d8c0,5.0,I loved working with customers and the staff that we work with is just as amazing as the customers. If we don't know what to do or how to do anything we always have support in helping us get it done.
Safeway,1bbu0a6tqbrd8akg,3.0,I really enjoy working with this company very nice people. I'm only a temp and hope I can get hired on permanent. Love my hours just hate the commute on raining days overall ive learned a lot of new things
Safeway,1bbsstv6vbrcrfni,4.0,"Safeway is a fun and good place for young and older people to work. It teaches young workers the way around basic knowledge on customer service , problem solving skills and organization. Everyday I stock merchandise for the customers and for a good looking store. The management is in order and everyone works as a team. I enjoy working here."
Safeway,1bbsjjg29brcrdbd,3.0,"Safeway Good company to work. Workplace culture is a good team work. Hour as flexible with good benefits in 401K and Pension plan. If you work hard, you get paid more."
Safeway,1bbsg9lsvb895c7v,4.0,"this was my first job and i have no real complaints, i learned many of my customer service skills by starting off as a cashier. the downside is that you are required to be a union member in order to work for the company, my dues as a cashier were $50 a month just to have a job!!!"
Safeway,1bbs1q1ccak52e4g,2.0,Very busy with limited staff.  They cut hours all the time.  The benefits are good and only need to work 20 hours to get them. Seems like they care more about money than staff or customers.
Safeway,1bbrurq6tb89589s,4.0,Its a great place to work with plenty of room to grow. Co-workers are great and friendly. Customers can get on your nerves but hey its a grocery store so its going to happen. Team work is an important role because it will help the days go by faster and you'll be able to enjoy them.
Safeway,1bbrre1jqb851dp3,4.0,The work was easy and fast paced. Co workers weren't always friendly and turned their nose to new people. The deli manager encouraged drug use which caused me to switch departments. Night crew was amazing and management was always on top of things.
Safeway,1bbrqsv4cbrcrc7s,4.0,"The work/life balance really differed by department, but it was good in the Finance department (Avg 60+ hrs/week).  The people were great to work with, but the executives made some questionable decisions that were responsible for Safeway getting into the position where an acquisition/merger was necessitated.  I enjoyed my time there as I was able to work with some great people, advance my career and move to different areas within a large organization."
Safeway,1bbrpv1p0brcr9e0,5.0,It was fun  and hard work.  Also made alot of Good friends. I did not mind doing the early morning shift and getting home earlier.  the hardst part is pulling the carts apart when frozen during winter.
Safeway,1bbrjo4tvb811cib,4.0,"The people were friendly and were very appreciative of hard work. At times of the day there would be rushes but that should be expected and we got through them as a team. I worked as a night time supervisor and was responsible for all of the employees in the store so I'd have to jump between departments making sure everything was getting done while also getting my work done by the end of the night. I'd often have to work after my shift ended if the day was too busy. It was hard being a full time student and full time employee, but I finally made it through school, so it's not impossible."
Safeway,1bbrdag15b8958th,3.0,Safeway is a great company for pay and benefits. However the management there isn't to great. They tend to not help get you to where you need to be in order to be a productive member of the team and if you end up failing they'll fire you at the drop of a dime.
Safeway,1bbqdlq8cb895837,4.0,"I worked here starting as a teen, and continued into adulthood. They provided excellent customer service training, It was also union driven with great employee support."
Safeway,1bbq7vtqlb8519k3,4.0,Customer Service Based Retail Establishment with positive energy and a Successful Raport with its customers and employees. Fast Advancement at the Retail Level.
Safeway,1bbq4lnmpb8119jl,4.0,Safeway is a great place to work. The employees are fun to work with and the management are an outstanding group to interact with. Even with difficult people you still must act professional and respect their wishes.
Safeway,1bbpp3d3tb8959gp,2.0,"A company that only cares about how long you've worked there ; seniority and does not care about how hard you work or your customer service skills. Ridiculous work standards for minimum wage and lack of employees. I honestly hope I never work here again but that's just me. The whole store has to suffer if a certain department ""cough"" pharmacy messes up really bad so everyone gets their hours cut for longer than a year hoping they can compensate for their terrible decisions and expecting us to pick up the slack for other people's mistakes. I had to close the deli about 5 times by myself cause they were too cheap to hire an extra person, and after that they totally cut my hours saying I was the problem cause I wasn't smiling to customers. This is a place to get some money and get experience, it is not a stable job and they will throw you out like an expired container of hummus unless you call seniority and literally take someone's hours even though they can have a much stronger work ethic than you."
Safeway,1bbpaggffb811as2,4.0,"Great place to work, though no consistency with schedule.  New employees contracts are very different from the older contracts and seem unfair. Management was firm but fair."
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1bbot739bak52bn9,5.0,training progam is not efficent for new employees money is good and hours were good too. the breaks were very very short but the lunch was free and long
Safeway,1bbn68lq7b851ca8,3.0,Not too bad. The front end management was okay however the higher level management was like a monkey fornicating with a football. They seemed to have no idea what they were doing and very unorganized. No overtime either even when you worked overtime. In general it was an easy job(cashier) but very boring and repetative.
Safeway,1bbn0rer0b851ct5,4.0,You are on your feet all day and have a 30 min break. Monotonous work and repetitive. The days were very long and sometimes the hours were a little unreasonable. It was very hard to get time off.
Safeway,1bbmut396brcreva,2.0,I was taking orders for birthdays and going to get orders for customers close down bakery when it closes clean and make sure everything is sanitize help assist the cutting machine
Safeway,1bbmi5li1aqgn8lg,1.0,"I would score less management there was a nightmare no communication, you see new faces every week they cant keep people, advice to the new people going  in beware..."
Safeway,1bbmbrhf55n8qac0,4.0,A great work environment was established quickly during my time there. The management team as well as the a lot of my co-workers worked really hard so we could all come to meet one goal.
Safeway,1bbla0lveb8519ri,5.0,"As the bookkeeper for the store, I handle all the money as well as the records for the accounted money. I make copies and fax paperwork for the store. We also have a five line phone system that I answer and redirect calls to other departments. As part of being the bookkeeper I keep track of the weekly sales; also what money comes in the store. I keep track of all debit/credit transactions for each day in order to go back and look up customer charges if need be. After balancing and calculating for the day, I enter numbers into the express ordering system before closing it out for the day"
Safeway,1bbkslfpbb895eql,4.0,"The organization was eventually bought out by another grocery retailer. However, the corporate side of the business was well established and fun to work for."
Safeway,1bbje37tab811av7,3.0,"Typical as most retail type locations, hours vary unless you're in management. Best part of the day, coworkers. Hardest part of the day, unhappy customers."
Safeway,1bbi74grkb8118b0,4.0,"Great place to find out how to work hard. Was pushed everyday, and will take that with me my whole life. Learned valuable skills in terms of customer relations"
Safeway,1bbgvbj2cakgsbs4,4.0,"Work with grocery procurement specialists purchasing grocery all across the United States.  Working with internal and external teams ive gained and expert level of knowledge of the grocery business as a whole.  Covering not all procurement, but demand planning and the business impacts of sale and merchandising.  Hard working company with good communication and cooperation across teams to achieve results and minimize conflicts in business operations."
Safeway,1bbgcdtd0b851dug,3.0,It was one of the locations considered as one of the worst in the city.
Safeway,1bbfkao5oakcsdui,3.0,Employers who are understanding and are willing to work around schools schedule.  I learned how to have good customer service and that patience is key in retail.
Safeway,1bbf67u9jak929c7,5.0,I started at minimum wage and told my manager I wanted to move forward. He put me in positions to show my individual skill set and I became a manager in 65 days.
Safeway,1bbeg6kijakgschb,2.0,I would interact with many new people but a lot of the same regular customers as well. I would clean and maintain a clean work environment while interacting with customers and crafting the beverages.
Safeway,1bbeergt0brcr81c,1.0,Management was irresponsible and I had to correct mistakes made by management often. There was no support when I had food poisoning and my manager would not answer her phone. The scheduling didn't work with out department but our store director wouldn't make changes.
Safeway,1bbdel5uh5n8qbu1,1.0,"Like the job except the hours, I enjoy the people I work with,helping the customers find the items they are looking for,and deliverying to new customers."
Safeway,1bbdb39545n8qat7,2.0,Will never work for this company again management sucks they don't care about the well being or health of employees some employees get time and a half for holidays some don't they will have you working a department by yourself self when the work load is enough for 3 people and won't allow overtime so they expect you to work off the clock
Safeway,1bbc2m4bab88v9vm,2.0,"At vons there was to much drama and people talking trash about each other. If you associated with someone another person didn't like they would talk trash about you. The managers were kinda rude and not caring. I got sick for about a month or so, throughout the time of me being sick I could hardly breath and I let the managers let that know however they didn't care and they had me on carts."
Safeway,1bbc15ueqak508sc,4.0,I was able to travel with Safeway. I worked in Hawaii for 1.5 years and all over the colorado area. I liked the people and the job structure We had a lot of fun .

Safeway,1bbbu23q05n8qdof,3.0,very hectic and short stuffed. most of the time pharmacist has to do all the wor. no tech to help. pharmacist does all the work. hours are long and wait time for patients is short. Hard to provide customer service.
Safeway,1bb9o4905b80icn3,5.0,I extremely enjoyed the atmosphere within the work place and in patricular I loved the customer service work that I did. I could easily manage the work while having a fun experience as well.
Safeway,1bb9mi1g90kbt755,4.0,It felt as though the managers didn't care for their workers. Considering that there was so many departments to keep up with that it's as if they don't know your name. But besides that I enjoyed my time working there. It was  a great place to have your first job. It was fun seeing a new face every day. But you can't depend on management when something goes wrong because they can't keep up with all the workers.
Safeway,1bb9h15egbrchd23,3.0,Answered phones to customers looking to resolve issues. Learned contact resolution in a call center environment. The hardest part of the job was letting the customer go without resolution of their issue. I wouldn't admit to defeat and never gave up on achieving their happiness while resolving the conflict. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with other people and making them happy.
Safeway,1bb9ec2msb84j8ot,4.0,Safeway was willing to train me to be a cake decorator which was a huge blessing. enjoyed all the fun things we had to create and the bakery manager was great!
Safeway,1bb85qq6eb80ic55,3.0,"It is difficult to precisely explain the qualities of working at Safeway in a nutshell because it widely differs from store location and department.  For example, I transferred to another Safeway after a year of working (though not for negative reasons) and found the second Safeway to be much more laid back than the first."
Safeway,1bb82fmfdas0nfh8,3.0,"a typical day at Safeway, we would usually start out with helping up front with checking people out. by the end of the day i would usually be stocking shelves or checking inventory. i loved being able to help customers, but highly disliked when i would get that one rotten egg."
Safeway,1bb81kbp8ak4pakh,3.0,Well it was good at first then upper management messed everything up like they always do. The only thing I miss is how busy I always were when I was working for them.
Safeway,1bb7bnv12brchd3i,4.0,"I would make sure everything in cold cases were up to date and replaced. Made sure the product on shelves were dated correctly , In correct order.Stock when needed to."

Safeway,1bb72om940kbt4ta,3.0,"I worked for Safeway for 6 years, and I can say if you've got your head in the game the company has room for advancement. When I started with Safeway I worked part-time as a cashier and within 6 years I had run various departments and managed to become a store director."
Safeway,1bb70qmm7b80ibof,5.0,"great way to start a career, good environment, costumer experience is highly broadened. you learn about new merchandise, how to stock, also how to open or close a running corporate business."
Safeway,1bb4l2q6f1bgd0kt,4.0,"Safeway was my first experience working at 16. it was wonderful to be apart of a team working together to operate a store. I regularly helped all departments with collecting supplies and taking trash for them, I built store displays daily. I had a nightly responsibility of stocking all display shelves and making sure the entire store was swept and mopped."
Safeway,1bb4hfufsb88kb18,3.0,"Management was ok to a point but then again when I needed to leave for a family member funeral was told I could not go so I left and found a new job. Got moved back to seafood department was happy at first but then started not liking it. They only had me working from like 4-9 at night or 5-9 at night. The manger back there not started being rude every day and making things up all the time but things that he says I would not do, even those I was doing them."
Safeway,1bb4f01hub88ka3m,5.0,Good place to work and advance for a dedicated employee. Good benefits and communication from management to other employees. Good training programs and attention to employee needs.
Safeway,1bb4esps7akgjcqe,5.0,"I worked at Safeway in AK for a few months. It was fun and honestly if I had the option I would work there forever. I went to AK to work for the summer. I got hired on the spot and put to work. The hours weren't ridiculous,but not less than enough either. It was amazing and I would honestly work there again if I had the chance."
Safeway,1bb3br69a1fdt0r2,4.0,"A typical day at work would be me bagging groceries and cleaning bathrooms, the management was sub par and leaved a lot to be desired.

Safeway,1bb1kp0usb88hct5,3.0,"Irregular hours, always calling to ask employees to come in on their scheduled days off.  The hours vary greatly from week to week and unless you have a lot of seniority it is difficult to get enough hours to live on"
Safeway,1bavleuvsb84hcl6,4.0,a typical day of work here would include checking customers out. the biggest thing I learned at this company was running a check-out stand and all of the different fruits and vegetables. the management was decent some of the higher ups could have an attitude when asking them for money change to give the customers their money back. the hardest part of the job for me was standing in one spot for 8 hours a day and not being able to move around often.
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.

Safeway,1baqvogo11d0s6ah,2.0,"Standard grocery and customer service job. Hours are low if you're not full time. You have to join and pay the union in order to work at Safeway. Benefits aren't that great and are provided by the union, lay-offs frequent, management likes to schedule you to work at stores without asking you if that's doable. After layoff I was sent a letter in the mail to report to a city 2 hours away if I wanted to start work again."

Safeway,1banna9v00t8a66k,5.0,"This job first exposed me to the concept of customer service and it left a lasting impression. While the core parts of the job, stocking/wrapping were tedious, the emphasis the company placed on the customer gave it purpose.

Safeway,1baig0lo01d182lc,3.0,I had some great managers who actually cared about their employees and I had some terrible managers who cared only about their numbers and were not above threatening employees on the sales floor. I left when it seemed all the good managers were gone.

Safeway,1bagvgk151d181ae,1.0,"Management cared more about profits than about customer satisfaction and product quality, which often led to a difficult and uncomfortable work environment.

Safeway,1bagtal431fdm6a0,3.0,"I loved working at Safeway because the customers were so friendly and the job itself was worth dealing with the poor management conditions. Managers lost my paychecks on multiple occasions making it so I was not paid on time. They have extremely poor communication skills and neglected to tell me about union dues and other important things. They were never able to honestly answer any of my questions, either. It was hard to learn the job duties."
Safeway,1bags443e1d18731,3.0,"filling RX, stocking medication. assisting pharmacist. stocking mdication orders when they were delivered. completed my schooling and what I learned in school."
Safeway,1bagren231fdm263,5.0,"Vons ( Safeway) teaches great skill and advancement lessons. I worked in every possible area of the multiple stores I was employed at. Pay was very very low especially for my position of ""Customer Service/GM/ Bookeeper) where I trained new Bookeepers and traveled to close or far stores to do so (pay was not varied for this). As well a working in and helping in every aspect of the store in sync with the Manager and corporate. Wonderful company and so happy i started there, pay was a large disgrace however."
Safeway,1bag2ccp21ai712u,2.0,"No clear instructions for months, bearly any comfortable hours, absolutely random schedule, and extremely short breaks. The manager was unethical and unfair."
Safeway,1baf3svnf0mck385,5.0,A great worker and friendly to everyone i go out of the way for the customer great company to work for i love working with my coworkers
Safeway,1baecglpo0mtj3na,2.0,"Company is very strict about breaks. The second your 15/30 minutes are up, they'll be calling for you over the speakers. Allow no room for advancement or raises. Going above and beyond gets you very little if anything, messing up (even if it's minor) gets you a warning and a good slap on the wrist. The work is constant, breaks are given sparingly. If you have an eight hour shift and ask for your 30 minute lunch break, they'll make you stay an extra 30 minutes at the end of your shift. The work is mind-numbing, customers are incredibly rude for no reason way too frequently. The store I worked in was a 24-hour store, which adds a completely new dynamic of awful for the low-level employees, especially since there were no self-checkout lines in the store either, so cashiers were on the clock constantly."
Safeway,1bact6eg61bg62hp,2.0,This is a good company however the salary for the amount of physical hard work you are required to do doesn't compensate.
Safeway,1babt0v200mt3070,5.0,Awesome place to work! I would have stayed but the Union Payments were too high. Also the people were great and Its so much fun working at safe way!
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1babepf5g1d0n1pc,5.0,"Met a lot of great employees and customers, it was nothing but fun.  I learned a lot of new ways to handle and deescalate problems. I also learned how to use the cash register more efficiently. All in all, It was a great experience."
Safeway,1bab0gdpr0mtj4q2,3.0,You would have to do a floor sweep every hour. They trained you on almost everything.  They taught how the customers groceries are supposed to be organized.
Safeway,1baarmvpv1ahk1aj,5.0,Every day is different for me. I have learned so much but Im also still learning. The managers are amazing. The culture is different but its a good different. The hardest part is trying to figure out to what to do after my tasks are done. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers out.
Safeway,1baahg2ti1d182k4,3.0,In my experience always short staffed so everyone is always really tired and busy!
Safeway,1ba9i2ftn1d18571,3.0,"a typical work day starts off good, i have plenty of happy customers, and what i learned at this job is to keep to myself. management is ok. hardest part of the job is working until 1 or 2 am in the morning. the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know a few great coworkers and having awesome customers."
Safeway,1ba8j1n2p1fdm5j0,2.0,Worked in all types of weather. Took a long time to advance or change pay grades. Go through a lot of employee's. Some employee's been there a long time and did not put forth the effort that was expected from others.
Safeway,1ba8iarm71bg644e,4.0,I enjoyed working for Safeway because my work was interesting and somewhat challenging. I would code and process all invoices for two warehouses and I had to make sure all work was accurate and balanced . There were times when the work was challenging but fun. Great group of people to work with. I don't think there were very many times when I found the work itself to be hard but in some cases there were one or two persons that were hard to work for. The most enjoyable part was when I was able to help other employees gain experience in the accounting field.
Safeway,1ba8hno7c1d0n0c9,3.0,"Working at the Safeway location I worked at, there was a lot of customers who were drug abusers and there wasn't really any life work balance."
Safeway,1ba8b4n0t1d0n1s1,4.0,I worked at Safeway for the bakery department and enjoyed every moment. I especially enjoyed all of the fresh items we made daily. I would recommend Safeway to anyone who loves being around customers and working in a rewarding environment.
Safeway,1ba89rj4v1agm49m,4.0,"A typical workday included seeing many friendly faces, and assisting with many grateful customers. I acquired better communication skills while working for this company. Management was very helpful, and understanding of my scheduling needs, and always tried to grant me the days I requested off. Working at Safeway, there was a friendly feeling to the environment. As with most jobs, it was difficult to deal with stubborn customers, but there was always someone to lend a hand. The managers treated us with respect, and treated us like adults, even just as high school students. I enjoyed working for this company, and if I needed to, I would work for them again."
Safeway,1ba759id91d077l8,3.0,"I haven't worked there for quite some time, so management may have changed drastically, but my time there varied in terms of hours. As a full time student doing cashiering along with stocking was very taxing on the mind and body. I would come either at 3:30 p.m. or 5:30 p.m. and work until 12:30 a.m. or 2:30 a.m. I would cashier for 6 hours and stock/cashier the rest of the time. I would the top managers at the store I was working at were not very receptive to other employees. I felt as if they only saw money and not people."
Safeway,1ba6o3fuqb89rfn4,3.0,"A typical day would be clocking in, then going to check what your doing at what times of the day as in when you will be doing carts or when you will be inside bagging, helping customers, etc."
Safeway,1ba675snqakhcfun,5.0,"A typical day at work consisted of restocking shelves, completing nightly duties such as vendor ends, end caps, restocking coolers, etc. I learned a lot about how stores run. Amazing night management. Workplace can be stressful during rush hours. Once duties are done, very laid back."
Safeway,1ba5u2a1maqhsak5,3.0,"It's a retail job, so nothing out of the ordinary. As long as you like your coworkers it's not a bad place to be. It definitely kept me busy, which was awesome."
Safeway,1ba5u0jr2b84mabe,5.0,The company and management are frequently providing feedback and the means to improve. They are are willing to work with you to help you with necessary time. I feel welcome and secure in my position.
Safeway,1ba5lcrveb89rdkm,4.0,"Working there was fun. The other employees were always willing to help out in the time of need, and everyone treated each other like family, and as equals."
Safeway,1ba5ki3uj5nb2b61,4.0,"My job experience working at Safeway as a Courtesy Clerk was very helpful and I formed a lot of essential skills.  I swiftly picked up useful janitor jobs that I wasn't familiar with before, costumer service skills, bagged groceries and stocked shelves.  Every Lesson I learned at work was very beneficial."
Safeway,1ba55agflaqhse4c,5.0,A typical day is customer service

Safeway,1ba3tncjbbrepbo7,4.0,"If you work a certain amount of hours (20 I believe) you receive benefits. Loved my coworkers, felt like a second family. Great customers and relationships that last! Not much discounts or anything for employees unfortunately. Good job security; everyone needs to eat right!"
Safeway,1ba3tl7jcas1lep5,2.0,I was always working and didn't get the choice to get days off even when asked for in advance. I was always picking up others hours when I didn't get hours off myself.
Safeway,1ba3k24ekb89rf3l,1.0,"It is a great place to work for a short time but not a place to make a career. It was a great place when I started, but then the policies and procedures flipped completely, hours were cut, and they expected you to do the work of 3+ people by yourself."
Safeway,1ba3h007ob82cfkc,2.0,this is one of the worst places I have ever worked. I worked in the deli department for 10 years and the deli manager was constantly talking behind her employees backs. The Management is very inconsistent on how people get treated. There is no attendance policy UNLESS they do not like you. Would not recommend this work place to even my worst enemy!!!!
Safeway,1ba3f01rn5nb2eos,2.0,Corporate functions as one giant bully and could care less about the store and employees.
Safeway,1ba36tisib82cbeu,4.0,Excellent starting point. this company is a great place to start a career and it assists with your growth. Great overall experience.
Safeway,1ba34ukbv52v0fa8,1.0,"Worst job experience I have ever had. If you don't believe me,"
Safeway,1ba2uv7ksb89rb7i,2.0,"Managers change every 6 months and change the way things were done, because they don't know the store.  Some do not know how to manage employees, just customers"
Safeway,1ba2t59i5ak9gb1d,4.0,Safeway is ok to work for but the management expect the world from you. enough is never enough and they dont like to help out much. nothing hard about job it just the management.
Safeway,1ba2mag9aak9gfhq,4.0,"Safeway was very good about providing training. Anytime you advanced in the company it was optional to go for training, but was recommended. During my sixteen years of employment I went for food safety and sanitation training, work place violence and harassment training, payroll and schedule writing and many more. I would take this training and hold classes at safeway, as this was part of my job."
Safeway,1ba14g611brem9ta,3.0,"I thought I would begin a long tenure when I was hired by Safeway. Within the first week of the job, I was miserable. The PM seemed to be more interested in flirting with the ladies than doing his job, there was a new PIC every night, and the techs gossiped regularly. the patients were downright horrible to us (I know, it's pharmacy, I'm used to it... but I shouldn't have someone threatening me with violence over the wait time on their RX)."
Safeway,1ba12p8na5neubni,5.0,"Safeway was one of my first jobs. i learned how to be responsible. i had a chance to work in multiple departments. The people are so nice and kind. I enjoyed working at the customer service counter , i love interacting with people."
Safeway,1ba0na6pkb828euh,3.0,Good place to work at and sometimes management is a bit questionable at times. As well sometimes people are on call when someone is on a day off from work.
Safeway,1ba0hs6nlas1jdg9,5.0,"I would to work, clocked in to start shift, and immediately get to work.  I would bag likeable items together. Then I would put the bag in the cart. I learned that at the end of the day they would have me put the donuts in a big bag and would throw them out. The store would put fresh ones out each day. The employees were very nice.  The hardest part of my job was picking up heavy trash bags and throwing them into the dumpsters below.  The most enjoyable part of my day is when the job ended for that day.  I could then clock out and go home."
Safeway,1b9udluktas1jbss,3.0,I enjoyed sprucing up the store with seasonal flowers and plants.  Management was always available to help.  Anytime I was having a bad day I could stop and smell the roses.
Safeway,1b9u9hn7cb89obfp,4.0,"i was a courtesy clerk and they had me running around doing every other job but my own, it seemed like every day i was doing someone elses job"
Safeway,1b9tt7ht25j6ja4r,5.0,"everything was positive about safeway: salary , management team, training, DM attitude"
Safeway,1b9tlhisvb84jc5i,4.0,"I worked for Safeway for four years.  In that time, I was able to move from a courtesy clerk to a coffee clerk, and crosstrain in floral and deli.  I generally liked the flexibility for hours, but I do not approve of the way I was treated by management during my pregnancy."
Safeway,1b9s6ofs8b84j9gs,3.0,"The best part of this job was the ability to walk to work. If I had been able to move up though the company, or store I would have staid with the company longer"
Safeway,1b9ri8ql7bremf05,4.0,Everyone that worked there was normally always in a positive mood and always willing to help everyone. Only negative thing would be the customers that would come into your line that would try to ruin your day
Safeway,1ds90b9394s1g803,4.0,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
Safeway,1b9ovjudeb828fvr,3.0,Overall a good place to work nice people.  Built good rapport with the public.  There's no healthcare.  You now have to work two years to get it.  There's not enough help scheduled to move the lines faster.  Some management is like a robot they don't really listen to the needs of their employees.  And some management is really good to their employees.  So not stable management.  Not a lot of opportunity for promotion.
Safeway,1b9op497ib89of89,5.0,"I like the enviroment, my coworkers and the enviroment. The customers are friendly and happy to see us. A downfall is that we don't always have enough staff so our lines get backed up."
Safeway,1b9oi7b75b828aj3,3.0,I am not very fond of the vons company.  but it was a job and i got paid .  So I gave my best and appreciated the new skills I picked up while working there.
Safeway,1b9nettd7b828b6q,4.0,"Safeway is a nice company to work for, nice customers and co-workers, I  learned how much people out there are addicted to narcotic, seeing new born and hearing elderly's surgery stories, co-worker transfer in between store stories. The hardest part for me are ""medicare's payment rules"", I enjoy working at Safeway, because i get to hear new stories everyday from different customers."
Safeway,1b9n9um6ab84j92f,5.0,i worked as cashier in safeway. safeway is a verry good company. everyone is very helpful in safeway. safeway is a big company and they also give lot of benefits when we work with them. Thanks
Safeway,1b9n5u5vmb828djv,3.0,Hard work and a lot to remember in training but once you're on the floor it becomes a lot easier. It was a great busy company with a lot to do. you'll never be bored. They could pay their employees more.
Safeway,1b9mokv0ab84j940,4.0,"A good place to work at, not the best place if you don't like to stand for 8 hours a day doing many projects. Management is not set as good as it use to but still a good place to work."
Safeway,1b9ml3f2jb84jbes,5.0,I have an everlasting love for Safeway. I would've continued my career with them if they hadn't sold the company and starting eliminating positions.
Safeway,1b9ltuqirb828deo,4.0,Not too thrilled with working at Safeway again. A lot to do in the service desk yet only one person works at a time because they really don't have anyone. Management likes to keep close eye on every. Sometimes feels like they are trying to find a way to write you up.
Safeway,1b9kpv3gdbrem9mi,3.0,Working at a grocery store is for some people. I am not really one of those people. It wasn't a bad job and I didn't dislike it. It was just not the best fit for me.
Safeway,1b9kesl9db89oft7,4.0,My typical work day was different every time and I learned a lot over my two years there. The management was great and they made sure that you do your job and do it well. The hardest part of my job is multi tasking I was getting called for something what felt like every minute. The most enjoyable part of my job Is talking to customers.
Safeway,1b9k45nk3breme23,5.0,"There were days where it gets busy or when we have a new shipment come in, but for the most part the work is pretty steady, i learned how to stock shelves and improve my customer service."
Safeway,1b9jm6pqgb84jco0,3.0,"typical grocery store chain, you fill in one of their open positions. Sometimes you get to do something different. I enjoyed working in the deli and restocking the shelves."
Safeway,1b9jkqvepb84j9md,3.0,Working with public was a plus. Being able to help people with their choices and enjoying feed back from those choices. Hardest part of job was having to be at work by 4am but loved working with public.
Safeway,1b9jfu2jobremfkf,4.0,It is all about getting your team to work together if you are able to build one or inherit on the quicker you get them to buy into your vision and get the main players in your store on your team the quicker you will succeed but you fail at winning the players over you will lose.
Safeway,1b9ib2vj9b89obp6,5.0,Great management and amazing benefits! You will always be learning something new every day. Pay is great and it is weekly. I worked at the customer support Center for 6 years and enjoyed every bit of it.
Safeway,1b9i9ltvlb828d7n,3.0,I feel like all stores are understaffed which makes it harder to do your designated job properly. If youre a manager forget about a life...you will be demanded to work crazy and unreasonable hours with seemingly no help.
Safeway,1b9h3iruv1d0q7iu,2.0,Working at Safeway is interesting because it feels as if the managment dosen't really respect their workers. To a new employee it would seem that they care more about earning money then their employee's respect and trust.
Safeway,1b9gvhjuk1d0q3on,2.0,"The people I worked with in the bakery were great, everyone else, not so much. The store manager had no idea how a bakery was ran and would set ridicules deadlines for us and would nag as like we weren't doing anything when we were working our tails off. Then the CEOs' would throw need product at us, with no place to put them. Would take away popular items, with no warning and tried to make every store be the exact same and not always care what the customer liked."
Safeway,1b9gnd3ojbred9s7,4.0,"I liked Safeway . For a temp job that turned into a 23year job .It paid my bills and the medical /dental really came in handy . Like any job ,it is what you put in to it is what you are going to get out of it ."

Safeway,1b9g8vn7pak9afvf,3.0,"Management was ok at best. Don't know how the company is after the buy out. I was laid off because of down sizing. Went to work for Kroger after even though its the same type of company, they dont do much differently. Same bad enviornment"
Safeway,1b9en3itqas1gcs5,3.0,"A typical day at work consists of me serving customers 90% of the time that I am on the clock. I slice meat and cheese, make production, prep for the next. If I'm lucky I get to work on the register sometimes which helps my customer service skills. Learning how to deal with different people and their personalities, with a smile on your face is an important skill to have. I also work in other departments of Safeway not only the deli. I choose to expand my knowledge to benefit Safeway because an employee may call out or not show, then I will be available to work or help customers. I've learned to manage my time because customers want to be in and out so I try to work a fast pace. The workplace culture is pretty friendly and very homey since the Safeway I work at is small. There is no hard part about my job because after a year you're pretty used to working. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with customers."
Safeway,1b9ekpb8ibred96k,3.0,"At Safeway Starbucks, you are often expected to do the job of three baristas, due to a lack of staffing. You may end up running the entire kiosk by your self for hours at a time. Emotional break downs are something to look forward to."

Safeway,1b9d897hkbredaqq,2.0,"A good place to start as a young employee. I think there would be room for advancement because others around me had done it. Bagging groceries, pushing carts and stocking shelves. Meeting lots of new people and lots of different situations."
Safeway,1b9cv5jseb89g9cf,3.0,"typical day was bagging groceries, stocking shelves, cleaning bathrooms and collecting carts. management was hectic and very often rude to the workers"
Safeway,1b9cpb0nsb89ga4t,3.0,"Average paced job, not a lot of responsibilities. okay compensation. Okay management."
Safeway,1b9cjgrqh1d0q2sc,1.0,"The store I worked at was, and still is, a mess. Management didn't want to work with anyones schedule, they were rude, my store director actually FORGOT to do the paperwork for my raise and I had to threaten to call the union and corporate before I got what I should have been being paid. I also got zero backpay for that. My co-workers were all very nice though. Had management been better, I would have actually loved to stay, but it seems like management at all safeway stores is just as incompetent from what I've heard from my old co-workers. Honestly just save yourself the hassle and don't work there. They will treat you horribly and use you as a doormat if you let them, and if you don't let them, they'll fire you."
Safeway,1b9cas2hiakh7cj5,4.0,"A regular business day at Safeway usually begins with making sure everything is stocked ,trash taken out , and entrances and bathrooms cleaned before customers come in. Having worked at vons prior to this job I new what to expect but I never thought this store location would be so different . Management is unfortunately very poor which has caused a decline in morale throughout the entire staff . The hardest part of the job for me is when I am contactly having to clean up either after the employees the worked before me or after other departments but I'd have to say the most enjoyable part of the job is being the last face the customer see before the leave , I always like to make sure they leave with a smile on their face."
Safeway,1b9ca1vpaakh79ug,5.0,"Great staff at this store. Sometimes we had so much work to do overnight we did not know what time in the morning we would leave. We got through it though and always made it fun, My wife and I still shop at this store for the quality and for the staff."
Safeway,1b9amfnlr5narfmv,3.0,"Safeway is a pleasant place to work compared to most companies. We had our own union and we also received 1 week paid vacation every year. Also, we got paid every week which was nice. Most employees were very kind, honest and dedicated to their job. The hardest part about the job was dealing with difficult customers, but there are some regular customers there that make it worthwhile."
Safeway,1b9al7cf41d0q16f,3.0,"Can be great when you work with the right team, but every store manager I have worked under has been dismissive and doesn't seem to understand what its actually like for their front end teams. Job hours rarely consistant, company always looking to cut corners. Always hiring, though. Decent starting job."
Safeway,1b9ajav8f5nemdrt,3.0,"The typical day at safeway would be engaging conversation with customer and doing the best of my ability to get the customer what they and have them wanting to come back. My job consist of slicing, weighing and selling merchandise such as hams, turkeys, cheeses, and chicken. What I have learned the most from my job is customer service skills, such as engaging with the customer, seeing what the customer likes and working with the best of your ability to get the customer exactly what he/she wants."
Safeway,1b9a9m97c5narfi4,1.0,"Was a decent job and pretty easy.  However, someone forgot to mention they were part of a union and that there were fees for being in it.  I wasn't told of this until the day I was let go."
Safeway,1b9a1in13as1g9dt,3.0,"The managers there hated their life, and everyone working there knew it and felt the same way. The only difference between this and any work place was the open disgust for the company that everyone shared."
Safeway,1b990seh2bredb7l,2.0,Terrible management that does not know how to adapt or motivate their employees. The culture is bad. There are very little opportunities to advance.
Safeway,1b97r8obb1d0q09n,1.0,"I did not like working at Safeway at all. A typical day of work consists of being overworked and not thanked at all, you have to check off a huge list that you have to complete in 30 min, to thoroughly do the job right it takes at least 1 hour to do everything on the list (most people dont even do it and just clock in that they did). It is just unrealistic to think that one person call do all that in 30 min, especially if there are staffing issues (which there is a lot of)."
Safeway,1b974nen41d0q57k,3.0,This is a job that expects way more from you then what you are payed to do (minimum wage). You are also not guaranteed hours or a specific schedule. You are there to do whatever they want regardless of what position you are in. Due to this there is a constant flow of new people coming and going.
Safeway,1b9713s5oakh7f99,4.0,Its a nice place to work. Employees and guests are nice. Nice location. Nice pay. Easy work............ The managers try to work with you on scheduling.

Safeway,1b96mdi691d0q3hu,5.0,Honestly I loved working at Safeway! It is mine and my mothers daily store to go shopping at. Sometimes though I didn't like it. Sometimes I was treated rudely by a coworker because I just made a mistake and I had only been working there for a month... The women that hired me was great and over all the nicest person I worked with. I only worked there for almost 2 months and quit because I had to go back to school. I would be pushing 5-10 carts at a time in all black in 100 degree heat or more. I believe I should have been paid more by the hour then I was being.
Safeway,1b96mbh97b821dvc,2.0,Successfully.  Lots of meetings on the brands.  Vendor reviews.

Safeway,1b9273520aqhldvk,5.0,"Working at Safeway near to where I live and have gone to school, it was a great environment to work in and was very enjoyable. Seeing and interacting with people that I have known or seen was always a great time. With that being said the pay was not the greatest making 8.40/hour and working 25-35 hours a week was not the best, but being paid weekly was beneficial to myself and convenient. It also allowed me to do grocery shopping when needed without having to travel very far. My overall experience was a great one."
