Particle Measuring Systems,1eptlle8ru35m800,4.0,Work is monotonous. Pay is above minimum wage. Not a ton of room for advancement and the pay increase is nothing to write home about. Covid times have made this worse. Overall a good company to work for regardless.
Particle Measuring Systems,1e3tgjoi8o21v803,3.0,"I loved my job and the people I worked with, but I was completely overwhelmed with my workload when my supervisor didn't follow through on hiring a new colleague after firing someone. I did not feel that my manager had my back, nor would he/she stick up for me when someone threw me under the bus, which is what happened. First time in my 25+ years that I have been fired."
Particle Measuring Systems,1duieqnfhhdnf801,3.0,Lots of quality people but it lacks quality senior management leadership. They say the words but do not follow up with their action. Ok place to work but not a place to grow

Particle Measuring Systems,1dd7b6fgih438800,3.0,"The leadership is now obsessed with growing at a pace to prevent the parent company Spectris from selling it off.

Particle Measuring Systems,1am87bcq2ak7nc7c,1.0,"Interesting for sure. The director asked me in my interview about my husband. What does that have to do with my skills and abilities?

Excelitas Technologies,1f0b6b5fat4q1800,2.0,"IF you have experience in the industry it’s a great place to work.No forced overtime,advancement etc. but some jobs workers are treated like dirt.My job had no advancement (according to HR) but in some ways a lot of responsibility and STRESS.Was there 4 years and it kept getting worse.In summary management did NOT support my job (only one  of its kind in the factory) too the point you could not believe it’s the same company."

Excelitas Technologies,1dkdlsbu9h3hs804,2.0,"Excelitas has a lot of potential to be a great company to work for.  But, there are too many senior leaders that are more concerned with getting new business and climbing the ladder instead of focusing on their employees and the business that they currently have.  Continuous improvement is frowned upon, constructive or destructive criticism is nonexistent and the leadership team never leads by example.  The expectation is always bottom up and never top down."

Excelitas Technologies,1dhijoid7b82k802,1.0,The management doesn't even bother to take serious about what the employees feedback to them. Doesn't appreciate what we done for so many years. Treat employee with no respect.

Excelitas Technologies,1d86jusq41ahv000,1.0,"I was consistently told by my manager that I was at the top of my pay grade and there were no promotions available after shattering expectations year after year and being the consensus best at my position. I was finally told that a raise/promotion would be available earlier this year and after six months of waiting I was then told again that no raises or promotions were possible. I put in my notice shortly after only to be told in my exit interview that I was ~$10,000 below the median salary for my position and nowhere near the top of my pay grade."
Excelitas Technologies,1d66v1dgg5nci800,4.0,Great place to work.  highly advanced work environment.  good managers.  good benefits and wages were ok but Boulder is a very expensive place to live
Excelitas Technologies,1d4ns29il0mt2000,1.0,Not Happy with this work place they just hire people temp and get rid of them when the job is done. Management promised being hired at 6 months and i was working for 9 months with out hire benefits or anything including holiday pay etc.

Boulder Medical Center,1f1pv00ucu40q800,3.0,"The lack of unity and clear vision keeps this organization stagnant. Co workers were wonderful! Flexible to accommodate, if you have a day time appt. Management, while they were supportive in certain situations,  lacked employee relations and conflict resolution skills.  Often felt reprimanded for speaking up to assist with changes or offer solutions. Pay range is on the lower end.  Otherwise, if you need short term place to work, and you can tolerate the cons, go for it."
Boulder Medical Center,1f5vqnhruu1bc800,3.0,Staff were great. Hungry for updates and communication. Oppressive surroundings. Needs remodeling.
Boulder Medical Center,1f0ve5du9n54g800,2.0,"This is a horrible place to work and the culture is extremely toxic.  It is not condusive to learning whatsoever.  I suggest that if you are interested in getting into the medical field, don't work here."
Boulder Medical Center,1esiftivku3cn800,5.0,"Collaborative culture and open to hearing the opinions of all the staff.  There was some turnover in the departments.  Mostly, everyone at BMC was kind and hardworking and willing to work with others."
Boulder Medical Center,1ef52jpe9pbqj800,5.0,A typical day would consist of the receptionist assisting the physicians of their department.
Boulder Medical Center,1e3vttvstotqs802,2.0,"The CEO constantly refers to the company as a 'family' but when it comes down to it, it isn't one. If it weren't for a few individuals and the need for a paycheck, I would have left sooner. Horrible pay. Most of management is not qualified to be a leader, let alone a manager... especially the Director of HR. Who knew memorizing a few HR laws got you a director level. HR is not a resource that employees look for due to"
Boulder Medical Center,1e1ujak0c25aa003,1.0,"I accepted the “psych NP” position... was told by CEO I’d have an assistant and flexible hours. Bold lies. They stuck me in a supply closet, patients would call it “the dungeon”, barely had room for a desk let alone a computer. You either interact with a pt or no one. No help. If you like seeing patients 8-5 then returning calls and doing prior auths from 5:30 -8 or 9 pm without administrative appreciation then by all means take this job. Biggest regret of my life."
Boulder Medical Center,1dqukunorh3io803,1.0,"BMC does not appreciate their employees, they do not like current employees to move up in the organization.  The CEO just wants his staff to do more for less, cutting corners where you shouldn't.  Do not appreciate staff with experience because then you would need to pay them more.  There have been some questioning hiring practices, and they do not fill positions with qualified employees."
Boulder Medical Center,1dokafvc9h3ph802,3.0,thing that makes it a little difficult.  The pay is not great and there is not much room for advancement.   It also seems that consistency between managers needs some help.
Boulder Medical Center,1dl8qatno24gt000,5.0,"I loved working with most of the people at the Med Center. I started out in records then move up to Medical Assistant. Most of the Dr's, co-workers etc are great people to work with. It's a company you can stay at for years."
Boulder Medical Center,1dj4gesoth3v0802,1.0,Employees with licenses are replaced by non licensed staff to save money.
Boulder Medical Center,1dgf9rfi424fe000,5.0,I enjoyed working at BMC especially the people I worked with. It is a smaller practice compared to a larger corporate environment so there was more cohesiveness amongst the staff as a whole.
Boulder Medical Center,1cj9bf9njak97a9m,5.0,"Newly hired for a phone triage position. Phone RN for a busy 6 physician Family Practice. Assess patient concerns during phone interactions, triage emergencies."
Boulder Medical Center,1cgab81a2akcif5r,3.0,"I love the people at Boulder Medical Center, but the management is very disorganized. There are exceptions to every policy and things change and employees aren't notified. The pay is not great especially for Boulder. The employees here are amazing and very patient oriented."
Boulder Medical Center,1cdg2dpcu1aid489,4.0,"In the time I was working at BMC, I saw 2 amazing business office coordinates do their best to make the front end work. They worked with my schooled when I went back to school, and with my time when I needed to kids to certain appointments. However, with time change, comes change in management. New manager comes, I felt like she hated me from the get go, since I started and because I was all ""natural"" I would never fit in her ""click.""  I wasn't planning on leaving, but she had other plans. So I decided to move on and leave before she had the chance of firing me."
Boulder Medical Center,1cbvmdks4akgneap,2.0,There was no training program for new employees that needed to learn the software and then turn around and train it. There was no opportunity to be taught by an expert on how the program worked. There was a false sense of accomplishment given by direct management only to be blindsided when upper management was present. They will always flounder in their small time culture and it is sad for all the dedicated people that take so much pride in taking care of patients there.
Boulder Medical Center,1c74a2cbpakf29ud,1.0,No one cares about you just a body. I would never recommend this place. I quit because management treated you like a number. I didn’t see my manager once while working there. Every one seemed stressed and was just trying to pay their bills.
Boulder Medical Center,1c6rh4qkvak7aao2,4.0,"RN wages significantly lower than the state average when I worked there. High turn over of MD staff. The company has three different locations, Boulder, Lousiville, and Foothills."
Boulder Medical Center,1bvbmssqtakgod8o,1.0,"While the company was very open to a new model of care in the beginning, they did not at all support me in this new role. The staff was very nice but management deceiving  and cut-throat and only money oriented, not the patients and clients."
Boulder Medical Center,1bn19t7nsb88u8oe,5.0,"Boulder Medical Center is a large company but it has a small company feel which makes it a great place to work! It is such a great place to work that there are employees who have been with BMC for decades. Because we are an out-patient clinic, there is a work-life balance that you can't find at hospitals - no weekends and no night shifts! You work hard while at BMC but have the time off that you need to rejuvenate outside of work with up to three weeks of PTO earned in your first year. Most of all, its the people at BMC that make it a great place to work. You can see how much they enjoy working with each other and our patients every day!"
Boulder Medical Center,1bmijvk3db80uafm,5.0,"I've worked at Boulder Medical Center for 8 months. I was told on my first day that ""you landed in a good place"" and I am happy to report that this is true! My job is fast-paced, which I really like (never a dull moment). Everyone I've met, including my supervisor, is very supportive, accepting of my ideas, and is interested in helping me grow in my position."

Boulder Medical Center,1b6lecij2ak578f9,5.0,"At Boulder Medical Center there are many specialties, therefore an environment that encourages growth. The hardest part of my job as a float, is when I am unable to fill the shoes of the MA I am filling in for. Administration is very supportive."
Boulder Medical Center,1b633b4ahas0pfjf,4.0,I have enjoyed the experiences of the different departments I've had the opportunity to work in. The physicians I have worked with are very knowledgeable and caring individuals.
Boulder Medical Center,1b4h878cgaqiceja,2.0,Amazing coworkers and doctors. Some flows in upper management.
Boulder Medical Center,19efma2l8b84gfr9,3.0,The hardest part of the job was learning the doctor's needs for scheduling. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing patients who were happy. Most of my co-workers were wonderful. Management could use some communication work. A very busy medical center which is part of what made it enjoyable for me.
Boulder Medical Center,18r44rc2ob84gfv0,4.0,"I worked in the orthopedics deptment and did 90% paperwork.  The people were very nice,but I expected to do much more patient care.  I did move over to the urgent care where I was allowed to do more patient care, but because of the fact that they were staffed with all RN's except for me again I was limited on what I ws allowed to do.  They are very out of date on equipment and pay."
Boulder Medical Center,18qlhdqfmak4gcn7,3.0,It was fine. Not much to tell. Some decent people to work with.
Boulder Medical Center,18k03kek1ak8gfi5,4.0,Large company with a lot of doctors and staff.   Patients love coming to this clinic and they also bring in their other family members because they get one on one care.

Boulder Medical Center,183m01eslb84gfoi,1.0,"There is little or no wiggle room in your job and day to day function. A manager is always reviewing, checking and berating you on your work."
Boulder Medical Center,17v0fgugrb84gf81,3.0,management and benefits were poor. got sick and management did not understand.
Boulder Medical Center,17uvtcppob80gauo,5.0,I was given the freedom to work independently on projects; we all were.  Large reports were run and it was broken up into section and we were all given a piece of the pie.  Clear instructions were given to all of us at one time.  This made working on things much easier as we could all ask questions and get immediate feedback.  We knew what was expected and had once weekly progress meetings.
Boulder Medical Center,16qskptn9adsg9ke,5.0,"Nice people. Fun work-place. Good managers. I see about 28 patients a day, doing heights,weights, vitals, treatments, immunize and give meds.,answer phones all day in between, and re-new medications to pharmacies. i fill out referrals, reqisitions, and help the other staff out. The hardest part of the job is trying to get everyone's needs met at the same time some days.The most enjoyable part of the job is the babies and kids."
Boulder Medical Center,16n8elro000004gl,2.0,was a good place to work worked for one dr assisted her with her pts supervisor was kind of overbearing

Northrop Grumman,1f7rakc5fo28m800,5.0,My experience so far has been great. I've worked in a faster-paced program as well as a slower-paced one and both have been enjoyable so far.
Northrop Grumman,1f772cech3obs000,3.0,working at this company is good but the manager and Sr management they doesn't help because i been worked for Northrop grumman for 5 months they changer my shift first and second for fourth time and  then i need help from human resources but still same thing i like to worked and help the company grow and Sr management keep changer my shift because my family i leave company and quit jobs it fun work for company
Northrop Grumman,1f771ospos7es800,5.0,"The senior engineers are really skilled and helpful at teaching less experienced engineers the methods and ideologies behind great engineering projects. The management structure rewards hard work and the PTO structure rewards loyalty. I always felt work life balance was really valued, but sometimes overtime was available on a voluntary basis. I felt it was easy to work with my manger to make a roadmap for my career. I felt a strong loyalty to my team, and a drive to do good work without the “family” culture that cuts into a lot of places and can be kind of uncomfortable at times. I can only speak to my team, but it seems like a group of driven individuals who have a common goal. It’s an exemplary culture."
Northrop Grumman,1f74mgamio1dh800,3.0,"Work life balance is very good. Process management could be more organized. Education and training opportunities are good, especially if you can take advantage of the college tuition program."
Northrop Grumman,1f6vkbvn331ha000,2.0,Good stepping stone if management likes you. You will often be left to figure out your job as the training is non existent. Managers don't know how to do what you do. Only certain groups will be able to grow and advance.
Northrop Grumman,1f6sl066b3obs000,1.0,Management and VPs job hop and play politics to advance their careers while leaving employees at the whims of their decisions. The “mission” and the customer drive the workflow since leadership has no clue how to lead or accomplish anything beyond winning an election (read promotion).
Northrop Grumman,1f6pg0uo03obs000,2.0,"Company prides itself on diversity and inclusion, But fails to back it up. When a program gets cancelled the management side get placed immediately and the employee side gets to fight over scraps or temporary positions. You will work lots of hours. Have zero work life balance. And be nothing but a number to the company. When they decide you are no longer welcome or needed they will find a reason to let you go. Unless your really good at kissing rings or living your life under the radar you will have a hard time staying sane in this company."
Northrop Grumman,1f6opflgm31ha000,3.0,They have various programs at the company so you can always switch between them. Also the work is technically challenging and interesting. 9/80 schedule is a good perk that allows to take care of errands. The pay is good for seasoned employees. Benefits are on par with other defense contractors.
Northrop Grumman,1f6oc0480s7es800,3.0,It's a good company. Manufacturing jobs are just depressing to me though. If you plan on becoming an engineer this is a good place to work. They will pay for your education and will possibly hire you as an engineer when you graduate.
Northrop Grumman,1f6o2cc4io1dh800,1.0,Lack of on the job training. Throw you into deep waters with lil training. Unfair treatment and very stressful environment. Had to seek out help on my own to do my job properly.
Northrop Grumman,1f6l7d492o26r800,2.0,Weird work culture. Engineers really look down on the hard working maintainers and technicians. Be prepared to have a few unfriendly run ins with security and or management there.
Northrop Grumman,1f6kov4pts7m8800,5.0,"Good co-workers, good management, flexible hours, 9-80 with every other Friday off, sometimes 10-80 allowed with every Friday off, paid overtime when approved, good benefits, Melbourne Florida is on the beach."
Northrop Grumman,1f6ihh9t0o2as800,5.0,Great place to work. Always had support from managers and co-workers. Programs in Sierra Vista provided the opportunity to gain experience in domestic and foreign business activities.
Northrop Grumman,1f6ib8ucio2cr800,1.0,"As a senior software engineer you can expect to make WELL under the industry average, while working hard and achieving your goals every year, only to have the management give you a ""meets expectations"" grade and keeping you at the same level year after year."
Northrop Grumman,1f6g303r7t4nb800,3.0,"Work flexibility is great!!! However, I often find myself searching for other opportunities elsewhere. Management has its picks and chooses of who they show favor."
Northrop Grumman,1f6fvq9i4t4nb800,1.0,Too much work for one person for a full time job.  Maybe two people.  I started and we lost 2 people in our department of 4 then I was expected to take on work from the 2 people that quit. Very poor management skills.  I found  another job quickly!
Northrop Grumman,1f6e6iqq2o21m800,4.0,The job was okay put the pay was not good I felt I needed to get pay more currency. For that type of work. Put the supervisor was awesome very nice and respectful guy.
Northrop Grumman,1f6dk5cg0u3a7800,4.0,Interesting and important work that challenges you to grow your skill set. You will be part of a team that is providing the best products to our military. Opportunities to be involved in specialized classified projects.
Northrop Grumman,1f602cmlhsa39800,5.0,Best job I ever had. Left for family illness and not able to return. I would go back in a heartbeat if at all possible. The submarine program was great.
Northrop Grumman,1f5s9g8eau4lu800,4.0,I worked for the Baltimore location and it really had a pleasant atmosphere. I really felt wanted and included in every decision made at this location. overall just great place

Northrop Grumman,1f40nbv9nu20v800,3.0,Great place to work. Had a great time and met some great people. Had the opportunity to work at multiple sites on both the east and wet coast. Would love to come back.
Northrop Grumman,1f3vud71bu20v800,3.0,"There is good and bad regardless of where you work. If you maintain a positive attitude, show up to work to actually work, then your experience will probably be favorable, however, if you see work as a social club, get involved in office politics, and feel you are super special and therefore entitled preferential treatment, you will probably not have the best experience. Every company is a ""good"" company and every one is ""bad"", at the end of the day your attitude, contributions, and overall work ethic will decide if it's ""good"" or ""bad""."
Northrop Grumman,1f3pj4kpunpee800,4.0,Experience will vary greatly in the organization and team. My team was helpful and friendly.
Northrop Grumman,1f3p4p2tgs7ft800,5.0,"Northrop Grumman is a fabulous place to work, offering a diverse and inclusive culture, state of the art capabilities, and a genuine interest in doing the right thing."
Northrop Grumman,1f3dpmq67u3bc800,5.0,This job really was enjoyable with it being remote and having a tight knit group of coworkers who all worked together to achieve success. I do not have anything negative to say.
Northrop Grumman,1f3bl6dgjo2a8800,5.0,Have to say Northrop will do what i can to keep people after a contract ends. This typically means work is pretty stable. My coworkers and managers are all pretty great.
Northrop Grumman,1f3bbm416o2a8800,2.0,Good work life balance
Northrop Grumman,1f37msjtgo2a8800,3.0,"If you are more traditional in beliefs/values and management style, it is a good place to be long-term. Most programs are sustained and upkept by older systematic approaches but pay is great."
Northrop Grumman,1f34bq6d7him2800,5.0,"I don't have anything negative to say about this company but the medical insurance is too expensive. The day goes by so fast. It is a fun place to work, it is challenging but it's a place where you can absorb so much experience. it could be fast pace or relaxing. People are friendly. Management is  is willing to work with you on getting you into a different position or stepping into the next level if you really want to; you set your goals. They have tuition reimbursement. It is easy to transfer to other areas or other states. They are very flexible with schedules; 9/80 schedule is awesome."
Northrop Grumman,1f33tor432v5r000,2.0,People are very helpful and welcome you. Benefits are good but not the best. Happy to be working but the pay is below what the industry pays. They lowball you and they’re unorganized.
Northrop Grumman,1f30tj8gf3h8b000,1.0,this is a terrible place to work.  i hated every moment of it.  the managers are idiots and it seems to be run by people who don't ccare for humanity.
Northrop Grumman,1f30iulk52v5r000,4.0,A stable and always striving to implement improvements to the organization. A very safety awareness program is in place and is communicated and enforced to the working community to improve ever ones environment.
Northrop Grumman,1f2p199mb2v5r000,4.0,Overall  it has ben a positive experience working at NG.  mgmt support can improve and career advancement can be slow.  i would recommend NG over all and for the most part enjoy working here.
Northrop Grumman,1f2ni681phim2800,4.0,"My company was purchased and absorbed, took forever but got a sweet pay raise for my troubles. They pay well, only wish they would have replaced our old leadership with better"
Northrop Grumman,1f2n0bnd32v5r000,5.0,"Great company to work for. 13 year air force veteran, straight to Northrop after separation and I couldn't be happier. You can work 40 hours a week or over 80, with overtime. The extra money is nice"
Northrop Grumman,1f2m758qt3ki8000,4.0,Long hours pay was great time away from home no room for advancement. Travel was great. Job opportunity wasn’t there. Too many bosses. Plenty of overtime
Northrop Grumman,1f2kq715b2v5r000,5.0,"Great company, hard work pays off. If you work hard and keep track of what you’re doing you can bring that up at your midyear and end of year review and get rewarded for it"
Northrop Grumman,1f2ijdjf72v5r000,5.0,"I've only done an internship with them so far, but it was a great experience although it was remote due to the pandemic. Hoping to work on site soon as a full time employee, we shall see how it goes!"
Northrop Grumman,1f2hkkn91309g000,4.0,"NG provided the rigor necessary to be knowledgeable in common industry practices. You can learn a lot if you work for the “right” manager or organization. Advancement is possible as long as you play the game (know the right ppl and be at least decent at your job). If your aspirations are much higher than middle management, unless you’re one of the “chosen” you’ll need to leave or you’ll be stuck."
Northrop Grumman,1f2b25qml3h8b000,1.0,"Was there for almost 8 years, only got 1 decent pay raise. Overworked and underpaid. I would not recommend. Customer was very demanding on unrealistic expectations."
Northrop Grumman,1ebfcse9urcsp800,5.0,"An amazing company, understands the military and provides a great culture. I would love to work the rest of my life at the company. They will help you with obtaining your goals and leave you in a good place for retirement."
Northrop Grumman,1f24u1el5u1v3800,5.0,Great company to work for!
Northrop Grumman,1f24oufh0u1v3800,4.0,I learned a lot working at Northrop/Grumman and always felt that the work was worthwhile and important. The worst part about the job was complying with often ridiculous government requirements.
Northrop Grumman,1f23pia4f2v5r000,5.0,"Opportunity to be involved with cutting edge work. Growing pains and management causing turnover, but that is to be expected. Supportive immediate manager, flexibility."
Northrop Grumman,1f21hp5jnt45n800,3.0,"Northrop Grumman is such a big place that you can make your own destiny. If you are intentional about getting yourself on a well-run program, you will have a great experience. If you just wait for things to happen, you probably won't be given the best opportunities."
Northrop Grumman,1f20im8dvu40q800,4.0,Enjoyable work experience! I've worked for Northrop for the past fifteen years.  The management and co-workers have all been easy to work with and the situations have all been fair and equitable.
Northrop Grumman,1f200s3jjt4pr800,4.0,Very professional environment. Management was always supportive. Very customer oriented with emphasis on customer satisfaction. My manager went out of her way to help me accomplish goals and be successful.
Northrop Grumman,1f1vjmf5unph7800,3.0,Good company to work for. Handle your business and perform daily job function and you'll be fine. That's all I have to say in regards to northrop grumman
Northrop Grumman,1f1pmfotsnph7800,5.0,The company was always able to respond to any questions about the job specifically. Out going with events for the family. Very compassionate about time off and any family issues. Flexible about the off time schedule. Precise about your Avenue to advance in the work place.
Northrop Grumman,1f1n6te6pt4cq800,5.0,Best company I have ever worked for. I wish I was still working there. My department really worked well as a team and I always knew what was on the agenda. Everything was well thought out and planned.
Northrop Grumman,1f1liu33bt4cq800,5.0,"Great place to work, the infrastructure is second to none I've experienced,  staff owns there work share.  An amazing group to work with, regret having to leave that job."
Northrop Grumman,1f1e01de1n53l800,2.0,"I was really looking forward to working at this company, but within less than a month of my first day they shared with the team I had been hired into that funding, which had been originally allocated late the previous year, had been substantially cut by as much as 50%, and that we were to stop all work and time charging immediately."
Northrop Grumman,1f1d01nr6t4q6800,4.0,"very tiny pay increases, they are quick to punish good workers yet allow riff raff to do as they please.  they don't follow up with promises, ""forgetfulness"" is prudent among requests, etc."
Northrop Grumman,1f1bfk6s1t4q6800,4.0,"The company offers really great benefits, the culture is diverse, supportive and they encourage growth. Upper level leadership is as expected mostly blind to the minute details of each employee and I'm not stating that as a negative. Middle and lower management could definitely use some work. Micro-managing is abundant, and some managers haven't quite grasped the concept of delegation and/or proper delegation of tasks. They are however very accommodating to help you find the right fit for you talents and skills, but sometimes there isn't a position available. Their ideas on what a manager should be is a bit outdated as well. Enlisted military beware... they DO NOT understand that those who have been SNCOs know how to be leaders and have been for 15+years,  nor do they pay you the same."
Northrop Grumman,1f18ol6luo1i4800,4.0,Worked with very nice managers and coworkers. Family atmosphere and everyone was treated respectfully. Pay was decent but raises could have been better.
Northrop Grumman,1f13jvg1go1i4800,4.0,"Have been supportive during pandemic. Work from home is standard for everyone that is not essential factory or working classified programs.  Good mix of commercial, NASA and classified programs in Gilbert."
Northrop Grumman,1f0v6vljrnpl8800,3.0,"I worked at several defense contractor companies and they're all relatively the same. Northrop does have better vacation time, 3 weeks to start. Pay is better than competitors. Management is poor. They hire you without having a role for you, which seems fine until you realize the managers want very specific skills. I came in as an RF engineer and when I met other managers to get on a project I quickly realized they were looking for programmers. I think you need to stay here a couple years before you start to get any work done. Overall it's not much different than other defense contractors."
Northrop Grumman,1f0udt0j53o8h000,4.0,It is a good company to work for however the promotions will come hardly.
Northrop Grumman,1f0ttrgueo1hv800,4.0,Work on new technologies and company invests back in people.  Was able to complete two masters degrees with assistance from the company.    Opportunities to move within the company.
Northrop Grumman,1f0s74r5bo1hv800,4.0,"Good place to work but like any company, training can be better. Lots of new young people  that needs better leadership. Sometimes direction is lacking and morning meetings are grilling sessions. Other than that, the products are cool and rewarding to work on."
Northrop Grumman,1f0mvcgkjn54g800,3.0,Company offers really good benefits.  If you are a contractor it can take a year or more before you can get hired permanently.  The pay could be a little more
Northrop Grumman,1ebfcse9urcsp800,5.0,"An amazing company, understands the military and provides a great culture. I would love to work the rest of my life at the company. They will help you with obtaining your goals and leave you in a good place for retirement."
Northrop Grumman,1f0kff8v8o1hv800,4.0,Good pay and raises. Building aircraft is not a bad job. Fun people to work with and for. Mandatory overtime is what I didn't like. It was supposed to be a 4/10 shift but turned into 6/10.
Northrop Grumman,1f0i6dijho1hv800,1.0,"Manger revolving door. Zero synergy in any department. Incompetent persons at every level, aging key stake holders not caring. Benefits are good after you work there long enough. Unless your salary. Might be better."
Northrop Grumman,1f0gt1dctn54g800,4.0,"Depending on which site you will begin your career with Northrop, you can advance a lot in your career. Good benefits and education allowance. 9/80 schedule is awesome. My manager always tries to help me and makes sure whatever my goals are, that they are met. People I work with are all considerate and are willing to help."
Northrop Grumman,1f0enik7anpfj800,4.0,The Sunnyvale site is a great place to work with a lot of camaraderie and people who take pride in their work.  Management is variable through the site and always changing.
Northrop Grumman,1f0bjfu8ghiq9800,4.0,You work hard and are compensated for said work. Great benefits and yearly bonuses. No real complaints about the compnay. Though it gets extremely hot.
Northrop Grumman,1f06317in306b000,2.0,Highly compensated cog within the inefficient machine of the US DOD. Not much actual work to be done. Lots of paperwork preventing actual work from being accomplished.
Northrop Grumman,1f00f6bebn5bi800,3.0,"As with all companies, you'll have good and bad programs and organizations. I feel like Northrop Grumman might be trending to not as good as it used to be. Definitely the case for my current program. Some toxic upper leadership is really hurting our team."
Northrop Grumman,1evrfqgobocao800,3.0,"If you enjoy working the same tasks each day then this would be the place for you. There is not much career growth because it is the mentality of ""do your time"" before promoting. However, I have seen people get promoted because they are the favorite, so really it doesn't matter how hard you work."
Northrop Grumman,1evqkpjfr26a4000,5.0,This is one of the best companies that I have ever worked at. They work with employees for your individual success. Pay raises and benefits  are adequate.
Northrop Grumman,1evq8euao26a4000,4.0,"Overall NGC is a big company with good benefit (not the best), but the organization need to have a better manager to help their engineer to be success."
Northrop Grumman,1evnif7bnocao800,5.0,"If you like a fast paced work environment where your work actually matters look no further.  They make parts for military aircraft like the F-35 to rockets.  They pay is great, you get regular raises on a consistent basis, they also give yearly ""merit"" increases kind of like a cost of living increase but you have to earn it, yearly profit sharing based on scrap rate, accidents and other factors.  They like to promote from within as well.  You get more support from you team leads than managers only because you interact with them more, managers help make sure the process runs smoothly and that the team leads have the materials they need to keep the shop floor running efficiently.  They do operate on what is called Six Sigma, efficiency = speed."
Northrop Grumman,1evk772u9npn0800,4.0,"Good opportunities for advancement, provided you apply for them through the company's system.  Management was pretty disorganized.  They didn't know the details of what they were managing"
Northrop Grumman,1evgk7r1nocao800,3.0,Basically the most basic company ever. Lot of opportunity to grow and develop skill sets and expanding useful knowledge. Would recommend to all friends and family.
Northrop Grumman,1evfvi4ll26a4000,5.0,"I love working here.  While work life balance is not possible since we are very busy, everyone is very helpful.  My manager is a wonderful person and very helpful."
Northrop Grumman,1ev8sc62en55l800,4.0,"Was a payroll processor ran all weekly  and biweekly reports and made all necessary corrections before the confirming of the payrolls. Such as all time loaded correctly, direct deposit is correct  and all employees were paid correctly with no missing hours."
Northrop Grumman,1ev5crv6ut5ho800,5.0,Northrop Grumman has a great culture as a company. Competitive pay and good upper management. I feel like a valued employee. The only reason I am moving on is because NG doesn't really have a commercial space presence.
Northrop Grumman,1ev4vearjt5ho800,3.0,"It was an awesome experience, however the culture needed a little development. A typical work day was from 0730-1430, several meetings per day with very little time to complete your work. Management expected you to complete work on time and if not, completed at home. Many managers did not have to leadership experience to to develop subordinates. Hardest part of the job was navigating management and leadership to get approvals. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people."
Northrop Grumman,1euvo6q2hnpna800,5.0,"I was very experienced at my job and worked at NGC for 15 years as nurse case manager for work comp and accommodations. I was a SME.  The job was very busy. I had to work with HR, ER, Legal, and the work comp adjusters and management. I worked with EH&S.  I received awards.  I had 2 awards for the accommodation process and work comp process from Platinum awards. I wrote articles in the daily news for NGC that came out everyday and I had articles in the daily news for  at least one to two times a month that dealt with health, wellness, accommodations, and work comp. The hardest part of my job was management. The most enjoyable part was working with the employees who were on work comp and employees that  needed accommodations.  I also enjoyed the VOICE ERG.  I was on the board.  There was an opening for the management job where I worked and I did not get it.  They picked in inexperienced outside person to get the job who only had HR experience.  My manager before the manager I had who picked the outside HR person called me and was upset I did not get the job. He thought I should quit too. I quit and gave 2 weeks notice and left.  The department fell apart in 3 months.  Now I work for General Dynamics IT and I am the manager for work comp for this sector.  I carry a case load of 200 employees.  I have received numerous awards.  Even though I have been at GDIT for 5 years, Northrop Grumman is the better company to work for and I miss it so much.  I really did not want to leave, but I had no choice."
Northrop Grumman,1euruq5eqo1i6800,5.0,"Northrop Grumman treated me very good, I worked there for over 40 years, and they were supportive through out my life, the best employer I could have ever asked for, and I would do it all again!"
Northrop Grumman,1euqccngk3h8h000,5.0,"Overall great company to work for though depends heavily on your team. The original team I started with was amazing but after three years it's a vastly different team due to promotions, shifting departments and attrition. I would definitely recommend working here despite this for the job security and compensation is tough to beat. The work is varied and interesting as well."
Northrop Grumman,1ebfcse9urcsp800,5.0,"An amazing company, understands the military and provides a great culture. I would love to work the rest of my life at the company. They will help you with obtaining your goals and leave you in a good place for retirement."
Northrop Grumman,1euo9bfeno15p800,5.0,You can go as far as you want here. Management wants you to keep climbing to new areas and roles. They are also ok with you staying in a role if you are succeeding at it and are not looking to advance.
Northrop Grumman,1eumtg2bj3h8h000,5.0,"Great place to work. It's rewarding seeing your hard work fault in an awesome product. The company cares about their employees, their career paths and work life balance."
Northrop Grumman,1euki2e2io15p800,4.0,Great work life balance. Daily scrums are kind of useless since some people don't show up but generally everyone is very nice and encouraging. Work can get monotonous and slow sometimes but glad to see new managers embracing new tools/technology.
Northrop Grumman,1euilfsvku1ki800,5.0,37 years doing some of the most interesting work.
Northrop Grumman,1euds86rbu1ki800,4.0,"I started in May, 2020 in the early days of the pandemic, so onboarding was all remote and somewhat chaotic.  My manager did a LOT of work to make it successful."
Northrop Grumman,1eu4js4lq3kh5000,3.0,"Working at Northrop is heavily dependent on your team, some days you'll get a decent amount of work and others you will get close to none. Management isnt really helpful and raises are very small. You will notice the bigger raise once promoted, but now they take forever to process your promotion. In addition, if you want to move to another team in another department or building, they're generally not very open about it. The good is that you will have a great work/life balance, gym is open if its in your building, people are nice and smart!"
Northrop Grumman,1eu4c1njsnq1f800,5.0,Wish I stayed and didn’t take a voluntary layoff
Northrop Grumman,1eu1n1sju3kh5000,2.0,"I worked as an engineer alongside production. Promised every other Friday off, and day shift. That ended up being the night shift, 10 hours a day, 6 days a week. People who only worked 45 hours a week were told they need to pick it up. I left that program and came over to GBSD as an engineer with the promise that I would work in ""X"" city alongside a mentor. I'm actually sitting an hour away from ""X"" city, and the ""mentor"" is in another state trying to train 12 other people at the same time. Its so mismanaged I spent weeks without even a computer or a desk. I was finally given a task to do after being here 4 months, and people are too busy to help me out with training. I have no idea what I'm doing every day, and its like pulling teeth to get answers to my questions. Some people love it here and have great managers, I just got the short end of the stick I guess."
Northrop Grumman,1etvo2k3hosn9800,1.0,If you weren’t one of the people who sucked up to the bosses then you didn’t get anywhere. If just did your job to the best of your abilities you were looked down upon. If you were lazy and a suck up then you get promoted
Northrop Grumman,1ethd1df7u221800,4.0,Great place to work.  Positive work environment with opportunity for growth and career advancement.  Lots of positive mentorac to help develop your career.
Northrop Grumman,1etglsg70o29g800,5.0,Overall the benefits and coworkers are what make this place awesome. I enjoy the recognition that is given by management and other employees. Reviews are given frequently which determines bonuses.
Northrop Grumman,1etbfk51kt48t800,5.0,"I enjoyed the work, the people I worked with, and most of the customers who visited and had to be logged in the system.   At 71, I would gladly go back and work their."
Northrop Grumman,1et8bhk4ppi26800,4.0,1575 is a cool new office that houses both manufacturing and the office. Tries to blend functionality with some perks of tech companies. Lunches in the cafeteria are expensive. Engineers co-mingled with finance. Nice cubes with doors that can shut. Pretty quiet environment. Difficult to move up as many promotions are time-based.
Northrop Grumman,1et4l5up6u1n1800,3.0,Northrop Grumman has excellent programs to work on via many contracts with the US Government and Governments around the world.  Contracts support the warfighter.  Benefits and compensation is comparable to other Defense Contractors.
Northrop Grumman,1esu9rhecu1n1800,4.0,Definitely a company of baby-boomers and less millennials. Company's process and implementations moves slow. It trying to move towards be agile but people are still slow to be innovative and embrace it. Still stuck in old way of thinking which takes forever to create change.
Northrop Grumman,1esquvenit4lr800,5.0,"I was an intern for summer COVID-19. The work was good, and they put a lot of work into making an inclusive remote-work environment. I am thinking of working at the company full-time."
Northrop Grumman,1eslebv7mu31u800,5.0,When you have an employer that values you;  as an employee you give 150% toward the job you are doing.  The workplace culture was one of inclusiveness and respect.
Northrop Grumman,1esiqhqogu31u800,5.0,401K allows you to invest in Fidelity Brokeragelink using any stock symbol on the exchanges  Great company to work for.  Salary is pretty good.  Flexible work schedules
Northrop Grumman,1esfr99r2npub800,1.0,"The management at the director level has zero regard for the safety, well-being or health of the employees. They are concerned with one thing: meeting their bonus markers."
Northrop Grumman,1esfq9v02t4l7800,1.0,"Many of the jobs are bait & switch. This is understandable if you have to wait a long time to get a clearance so that you can't do the type of work you applied and interviewed for, but this still happens even after you have your clearance and have been with the company for a while. I think a part of the problem is that they are usually short of people and or the roles they need they are not getting (qualified?) applicants for--so you are kind of dropped into these open spots and that's where you're stuck."
Northrop Grumman,1ebfcse9urcsp800,5.0,"An amazing company, understands the military and provides a great culture. I would love to work the rest of my life at the company. They will help you with obtaining your goals and leave you in a good place for retirement."
Northrop Grumman,1esesbkest4l7800,1.0,"There are some great people working at NG, but it won't be enough to keep you around. Everyday things change and there is no point in relying on a plan. They would rather run you ragged then defend you if anything comes up. The projects can be cool, but unless you handle stress and lack of direction I'd steer clear."
Northrop Grumman,1esdjfvvenpub800,5.0,Job Work/Life Balance is amazing.

Northrop Grumman,1es77ce423ogl000,5.0,"ME in manufacturing area. Lot of different projects and disciplines to work on and opportunity to work overtime. Have to learn how to work with people from different backgrounds (operators, specialists, inventory, supply chain). Can be really bureaucratic at times."
Northrop Grumman,1ertv9b4n3ogl000,4.0,Home work balance is great and the company for the most part makes you feel apart of something bigger. Management has gotten too clicky with under qualified workers getting positions because who they know. But overall good experience with room for development/growth.
Northrop Grumman,1ertbpalg3ogl000,5.0,"The tasks from a daily perspective challenge people through variability.  The culture is heavily focused on the quality and reliability of the products to support the warfighter.  Great products and excellent customer base with solid revenue growth potential.  Many leaders finding a path to promotion, but few internal candidates moving into leadership roles to fill the voids.  Values diversity."

Northrop Grumman,1erc6qcf4u35m800,5.0,"I always had a great time with the work and people at Northrop Grumman.  The compensation was commensurate to the position and experience.  I had a very reliable team that functioned well together, but also had a diverse set of individual skills."
Northrop Grumman,1erap3ab0u35m800,5.0,I got assigned a software role despite being a mechanical engineer (I have a cs minor). The work was very intellectually stimulating. The office and facilities were decent--nothing spectacular. The fellow interns were nice and smart people.
Northrop Grumman,1eqli60susa97800,5.0,"NG has always placed technical excellence at its peak goal. Though I suffered layoff due to force reduction, NG was never unfeeling or mechanical where its employees were concerned. A top shelf company."

Northrop Grumman,1eqiktroou35m800,1.0,Do not work there. Absolutely horrible. Management only cares about their monthly bonuses. They treat you like dirt. Worse place I’ve ever worked out. They lied during interview about pay and hours available. Nothing management said was true.
Northrop Grumman,1eq9ct2bco2gt800,4.0,90% of the business requires a security clearance.  Really looking for people with clearances right off the line. This narrow requirement puts programs understaffed and settling for less qualified people because they have a security clearance.  Contrary and backwards thinking if you ask me.
Northrop Grumman,1eq1jeb1cu35m800,4.0,My manager was trusting and allowed me to do my job without micro managing my daily activities.  He was one I could brainstorm ideas without fear.  There is an insufficient number of staff to get the job done well and effectively.  You are pushed to the limit to satisfy another's commitment.  There is a lot that could be said but it would fall on deft ears.
Northrop Grumman,1epsb770do2gs800,4.0,"Northrop is an excellent place to work. If you are looking for a secure organization that will give you a sense of purpose, this could be a great place for you."
Northrop Grumman,1eps0p47cu49m800,4.0,"Ngc is a nice place to work, you'll get to work on challenging products, with a rewarding feel due to the nature of the work (military). The benefits are nice as they use the 9/80 schedule, have flex time, and OT even for salaried employees. However, it is a challenging job, and you should expect to work pretty hard."
Northrop Grumman,1epna6329u49m800,2.0,"The company does a poor job of growing the entire workbase. Only focused on top performers club, and no opportunities if you don't get in. No transparency on who did what to get there and a tendency to move the goal posts and a better luck next year to those who did not."

Northrop Grumman,1epdh33odu32a800,1.0,"This company averages 2 to 3 minor or major reorganizations a year within Mission Systems.  While this might make sense from a management perspective, at a lower level its pure chaos and is adversely affecting the products that are created and now employee morale.  The company has an identity crisis and outside of space and air doesnt understand what to focus on.  Upper management has also shown a complete disdain for employees by forcefully selling off 6400 people and a huge portion of their Cyber, IT and internal R&D talent 2 weeks before Xmas including two of their most productive sys architects in recent company history.  Benefits, tuition assistance and pensions have been cut or minimized and its now just a very average defense contractor with below average leadership and vision.  Too much of a reliance upon Agile micromanagement for system building.  Stay away from this company if you are Cyber or until the dust settles.  You might find a great program, but do you really want to work for a company that sells you off like cattle?"

Northrop Grumman,1eonpp3b8u1e3800,5.0,I retired from Northrop Grumman in 2011 after 27 years at the Corporate office and loved working there.  Northrop was like a big family and takes great pride in the products it makes and each and every plane that comes off the line. I miss working at Northrop Grumman to this day and working with all the wonderful people I met along the way.  Best Company ever!!!
Northrop Grumman,1eon07m5qs7f8800,2.0,The only way to get promoted is to either sleep with your boss or be kin to someone. There is no way to work your way up on merits or hard work and the pay is good for this area.
Northrop Grumman,1eols46agnpgn800,3.0,"Although working at Northrop was a good experience I feel like the need for more hands on training was needed, as well as they need to update old equipment"

Northrop Grumman,1enpkmj9osaas800,5.0,"As a female engineer in the aerospace industry, I've never seen so many female program managers and regular managers in one company - this is HUGE progress in this male-dominated industry.   Almost everyone is technically top-notch.  There is a reason why this company is doing so well."
Northrop Grumman,1enorjr9tu2d6800,3.0,"NG is not a bad place at all to work. You can make average money, get decent benefits etc but it can be quite dry especially if you aren't an engineer. Sure you could work here and have a pretty nice standard of living it is just boring and dry. Feels a little like the matrix. A cog in a wheel in a cube doing mindless work. Would go back though if I was in a pinch to reset my life if I fell off the wagon and had to."
Northrop Grumman,1enoo3921saas800,4.0,"NG has domestic and international operations with excellent and mature engineering, business, HR, and T&E organizations. Their peer reviews are key to their success. Highly customer focused, employees come second but are well managed and highly respected professionals who are well trained; they have well equipped labs and have on-site advanced technical degrees available through local universities that are located onsite at main NG campuses such as Melbourne Florida.  Some outlying NG sites such as those in West Virginia are much poorer in employee support and satisfaction; and have fewer onsite employee services such as training and HR."

Northrop Grumman,1enkmkh43o15h800,1.0,"Worst place I ever worked as an IT professional.  Back stabbing and out right hostile co-workers and clueless management.

Northrop Grumman,1enf7tiact59p800,5.0,"I came to work everyday that I had to work, was never late, was willing to help and assist everyone that could use my experience.

Northrop Grumman,1em36tis4s7e8800,2.0,"It was an awesome place to work b4 NG bought out OrbitalATK. The usual big corporation, you're  no longer a person, but a # and a $ as they slowly, but surely strip the progressive raises, a point system, more ridiculous rules, etc."

Northrop Grumman,1elvd629js7e8800,3.0,"I worked for Northrop Grumman I.T. when they acquired Newport News Shipbuilding. I worked with amazingly bright, kind people from the original organization. While I was not laid off, other people were. NG wasn't hesitant to cut labor costs to increase profit."

Northrop Grumman,1ele0e8d2u2j4800,3.0,"Ok company, not the best i worked for in mg 35 years in software development role.  IMHO Aurora location is more concerned with being extra inclusive of homosexual community/workers than heterosexual individuals."
Northrop Grumman,1el6a2usanq3q800,4.0,This place provided a sense of purpose when working on different projects. I was able to grow and had a great manager who help support me to branch out and learn new things. I would recommend this place.
Northrop Grumman,1el4kleqco1h3800,5.0,The work was interesting and I was busy most of the time. Management was good for the most part but there was some managers that were hard to work for and expected too much even when they they weren't my manager. The hours were flexible and family is important to the company. The benefits were really good. I did feel like I was being held back and was kept too busy to be able to advance my career and receive the additional training that was available.
Northrop Grumman,1el1a4t72o1eg800,5.0,"Best place to work, great management support an work life balance. Carrier growth, training, tuition, job rotations, mentoring, managers care about professional training and growth ."
Northrop Grumman,1ekmh8ep9o1e7800,1.0,"I had over 30 years experience in Quality & knew there was always more to learn.  Aerospace is a great learning arena. I spent over 10 years with this facility, resigned earlier this year. The biggest downfall was the lack of communication, insufficient training & hiring unqualified management. (Ex. hiring a facility Quality Manager that had no previous experience in Quality, much less Aerospace). Trying to do your best meant dealing with ignorance & arrogance on a daily basis. Integrity was practiced by many, but not by most of higher positions. This place may look great on paper but it can be a very toxic work environment that can weigh on a persons health & well being."
Northrop Grumman,1ekjdngjhu1t7800,5.0,Great place to work. Very organized company with a matrix organizational structure to ensure that employees a career development goals are met. Functional managers and program leadership collaboration is key to employee satisfaction and retention. A company that truly care about their employees. Multiple programs at the Huntsville location provide immense opportunities for employees to develop their full potential and grow within the company. Many social and community activities including Employee Resource Groups! Great place to work  for all generations!
Northrop Grumman,1ekhkgfk3u1t7800,1.0,Work environment sucks rules are out rageous people are fake in it's like working in a high school environment.  It's like going back to school all over again with how many people are willing to tattle tale
Northrop Grumman,1ek9k588uu3t5800,4.0,"Overall I love my work, my team, and the mission. I feel rewarded in my job. Compensation is good. Promoting within a single role is fair. Trying to expand to other departments on a stretch assignment can be difficult, but worth it."
Northrop Grumman,1ejvbv1risa4h800,2.0,"Management has gone downhill since I first started a few years ago. Very competitive and manipulative, office politics are more important than genuinely recognizing hard working employees. Faked sympathy when employees lost loved ones to COVID-19 or otherwise -- they just wanted them to go right back to work because of lack of staff. Employees left because they were pushed out (politics) or they were tired of the environment, even some long-term employees who had worked there for over a decade. Overworked and underappreciated."
Northrop Grumman,1ejturfjau2v7800,3.0,Work day was 9 hours
Northrop Grumman,1ejqcn99knpt5800,1.0,"This review is for the Azusa location only and I have no experience with other branches of NG. The management is tone-deaf. You probably have  better results talking to a wall. The work was not steady, very few large projects, not much else. Compensation was decent, but terrible benefits and getting worse every year. I worked there a little over 1.5 years and I knew by the 6th month, this wasn't where I wanted to stay. The place feels like a state prison from the moment you enter. People are robotic and cold and no much socializing going on."

Northrop Grumman,1ejdr0hk2npr0800,3.0,"It's an okay place to work. However as a government contractor their medical benefits are not the greatest. Company culture is okay. Most employee activities are employee initiated, so not much on employee appreciation."
Northrop Grumman,1ejcaefbunptn800,5.0,"Northrop Grumman made me enjoy my choice of major in college even more. Not only did they provide me with opportunities to grow within the company, but I was exposed to multiple professions and teams on each program that taught me new skills I never would have learned in school. The communication between management and employees is carefully structured to ensure not only proper communication, but involvement from each level. Whether it’s a starting point or an ending point, Northrop has so much to offer , with new opportunities being added daily."

Northrop Grumman,1eig54nc2ree1800,5.0,"Not a bad place to work, great place to advance, rather quickly. Problem is, there is no accountability for people who mess up parts, or leave machines not properly 5s, it's almost like 5s is there, only for the name, and not utilized, or followed at all."
Northrop Grumman,1eiffkp9rsqbl800,2.0,"I worked as a High School Technical Intern. I barely had any training. All of my training was on an outdated website that taught me things irrelevant to my job title. My manager seemed as though she had no time for me, because she was busy meeting deadlines and so was everybody else. It seems you have to already know how to do your job before you get here. Unless you get lucky and have a great manager or coworkers that are willing to train you, I warn high school interns to stay away. The pay was the only reason I stayed for as long as I did. Oh, and don't get me started on the ""meetings""......."
Northrop Grumman,1eiefqq1bocr4800,5.0,"In my experience, Northrop Grumman is an excellent company who values their employees more than most in the industry. If you need to have someone hovering over you to ensure you get things done correctly and in a timely manner then this is not the place for you. If you are self motivated and value the quality of your work then look no further."
Northrop Grumman,1eibve02bof3u800,5.0,"Only left due to politics, otherwise good company to work for.  Flexible scheduling.  Collaborative, friendly environment. Very welcoming for those new to the workforce."

Northrop Grumman,1eh9039ojqboo800,3.0,"Very territorial work environment; people hoard work and resources.  When you accidentally venture into someone else's work responsibilities, you will be pushed aside, not welcomed. People actually yell at each other when they're upset. Program managers seem to think that kind of behavior is okay. Lots of organization and process; average teamwork.  The parking lot is full of weeds and cracks.  Missing hooks in restroom stalls - no place to put one's gear. Very tight work spaces, even for senior staff. Someone had the idea that Agile processes are facilitated by people crammed together in former computer rooms. Little pride of ownership evident in the upkeep of the exterior facilities.   Makes me wonder about the quality of the work done."
Northrop Grumman,1eh7e1go239uj000,5.0,I learn something along my job duties almost everyday. It stress free depending on your position and duties. You have a manager that may not be on your current team but they are actively involved in your needs and answering any questions you may ask.
Northrop Grumman,1eh39ecqk3cfd000,5.0,"Good company, I knew a lot of Northrup employees and they were all happy. I was dealing mostly with managing alerts for systems. When they went down I would go to my go-to Linux guy and he would fix it."

Northrop Grumman,1egqlbb6jq2r1800,4.0,"They are very focused on the mission but will take care of the employee as well. When a contract is lost or funding is cut from it, they work with the employee to find a place within the organization rather than cut them. This process can and sometime have taken more than a few months. This dedication to the employee is why they stay with the company."
Northrop Grumman,1ebfcse9urcsp800,5.0,"An amazing company, understands the military and provides a great culture. I would love to work the rest of my life at the company. They will help you with obtaining your goals and leave you in a good place for retirement."

Northrop Grumman,1ecl2q1s8rn3v800,2.0,they will tell you what you want to hear to hire you. They  will do it for enough time to get you but then screw with you. Do not believe they care for you family life or personal life. It all about business needs
Northrop Grumman,1ecah0gatr510800,5.0,"I have worked at Lockheed and Northrup they are similar good companies. When I walked in to Northrup I thought how I felt just like at ,Lockheed I had a sense of being at home in this company."

Northrop Grumman,1ec8iac28rccs800,4.0,This is like working in a factory a lot of walking not much support from management learn as you go you’re on your own. This Was a job that she’s been filled by a entry-level technician that can be trained and mentored
Northrop Grumman,1ec80s66crnci800,4.0,if you are considering working at Northrop Grumman Beltsville be aware that there are a lot of ridiculous personalities who are allowed to continue working despite numerous complaints against them.  Supervisors who work 2 or 3 hours per day and disappear for hours.  They show up again the next day and want to know why you haven't completed all the work in their absence.  This company is not willing to update practices because most employees have been doing things the same for 15+ years and DO NOT want to change.

Northrop Grumman,1eb4b5r34r4vm800,3.0,Review rankings and promotions are too subjective and heavily skewed towards younger workers. No real career path unless you make one yourself and get the required buy in from management.

Northrop Grumman,1e9rmf2tgq2r7800,4.0,"Overall this was a great place to work but it's really the people you work with that make it that way. As far as management, they have gotten better and more responsive since I have started there. However I feel there are people that end up getting away with a lot because managers are afraid of low morale and people retaliating against them if they do punish those that aren't doing a lot of work."

Northrop Grumman,1e9mleetaq2p9800,3.0,This company is all about numbers. I worked a contract for this company through the post office. They are only about numbers. We had not company functions outside of the company and they were always up in the air if the contract was going to be renewed with the post office. No job security and management sucks.
Northrop Grumman,1e9m4b6l6olq6800,5.0,Great atmosphere with fellow coworkers and easy to find or ask help from others. Getting technology related materials (ie laptops) does take a while as it goes through management but otherwise there is a lot to learn and people willing to teach.

Northrop Grumman,1e9k7k1hfp0at800,3.0,"Through everything all employees feel that we are only there to make the company money.  Most Defense companies give three weeks vacation and 10 paid holidays.  NG gives two weeks vacation and the almost week off at Christmas time is made from the holidays not given throughout the year.  When it comes to the benefit to the employee or the company it is the benefit to the company.  Year end reviews are terrible, only 1% of a department across the entire company are recognized for a raise or bonus.  Often times you get no raise and never get a bonus no matter how much you work, how much you save the company or the money and engineering you provide.  The annual ratings on management are very poor.  The company prides itself on diversity as that is the only thing it is succeeding at."

After working here for over a year, I still don't know where to find that guidance either. The reasoning behind every decision is ""that's how we did it before"". Not a good environment for an engineer that likes engineering. More of an environment for someone who realized too late that they didn't actually like engineering but couldn't switch majors. Also, it's widely known that they don't fire employees, so there are many, many people that are very bad at their job, and have been for 20+ years that continually get satisfactory performance reviews. Very demoralizing place to be."

Northrop Grumman,1e30g349532nd002,5.0,"I’ve had the opportunity to supervise 5 employees, and train them in the propulsion shop. I’ve exercised my knowledge and skills to provide a quality product to the customer on a timely manner."
Northrop Grumman,1e30auc4pol98803,3.0,"If you like being micromanaged this is the place for you. Your job will require constant staus updates and a management team that is scared of the Vice President. If your on good terms with the VP, then you will be ok, otherwise cya later."
Northrop Grumman,1e2vc3b7632nd000,5.0,Enjoyed my life at Northrop the interaction with all the suppliers and the military personnel was very rewarding and a learning process at the same time
Northrop Grumman,1e2uuhp0bhb1l803,4.0,"The work is fairly easy and the pay is good, every other Friday is off so that's nice.  If you're looking to raise a family and live life this is a good company to settle down with.  If you're looking to advance your career and knowledge, keep looking."
Northrop Grumman,1e2th7otlbm7p802,5.0,I am a technical illustrator and I work with wonderful technical writers and management who keep me busy all the time! Love this place.
Northrop Grumman,1e2s6uvdthc36803,5.0,NG has and remains an amazing company to work for. The work is exciting and is equally challenging. There are always opportunities if you know where to look.
Northrop Grumman,1e2p6e1joq5bf803,3.0,"The pay is good and so are the benefits. The people I work with are very helpful and all of them are consummate professionals. The finest machinists I have ever worked with, although some of the inspectors are a bit light on their work ethic. That's talking about the Union people. The management by and large leaves something to be desired. Only thing is most of the tools were made before I was born and sometimes that's all you've got. Yet we make it work and hold tenths and that gives me a lot of satisfaction."
Northrop Grumman,1e2ob33t232n2003,4.0,"Excellent place to work, my only complaint was the salary was not what I was worth in the job market. Management was supportive and encouraging. NGC offers good benefits at a fair price."
Northrop Grumman,1e2nbe01gq5bf800,5.0,Great place to work positive environment great attitudes from everyone great pay benefits huge place lots of parking very helpful leads and people northrup Grumman is a great place
Northrop Grumman,1e2mvfu7h32n2002,4.0,Lots of cost cutting in the industry and NG is no different. Look out for your own career. Not a bad place to work otherwise.. they make an attempt to do the right thing for you.
Northrop Grumman,1e2mii0m6o2n4803,5.0,"Great technical challenges, compensation, and management.  The company allows employees to move to other areas that best suits the employee. Highly recommended  for engineers looking for career growth."

Northrop Grumman,1e2mhases32n2001,3.0,"As part of a support department, I don't have the experience around our products as much so i interface more with the beaurocratic parts of the business. Some places are great, some aren't--a lot of it comes down to who your leadership is. They can make or break your time here."
Northrop Grumman,1e2mdsaioo9r3803,5.0,Great place to work good benefit at the time of my retirement good pension great 401k thing have changed my last few years  no pension for employees coming to work there after 2008
Northrop Grumman,1e2lij78948gq803,5.0,"This job is very rewarding, withc many opportunities to grow professionally. From the CEO, to Regional Managers, to direct Managers, and fellow colleagues, this place makes you feel welcome and a part of a team."
Northrop Grumman,1e2k1oqg7o2hd806,1.0,Culture doesn't allow for creativity or differing styles--driving out the smart ones and keeping the worst on the rolls and protected.  I would run away from NGAS as soon as you can--it is getting worse especially in Dayton.  Leadership is hard to find and always from the top down and to the numbers.  A few people work 60+ hours a week to keep the wheels on and are not rewarded for it.
Northrop Grumman,1e2jrd1kihael803,3.0,The management here seems to run people out of town after a while. It doesn't seem too often that you run into a manager that you want to stick around for. Too much politics.
Northrop Grumman,1e2jr0f2uf22o803,5.0,"Great company and really works for me when I, in-turn, worked for them. Family-friendly environment and the other employees really looked out for one another."
Northrop Grumman,1e2jffpmaq5jp802,5.0,I work with a great group. The management is very family-oriented and flexible. There is room for growth and moving up in the company. They provide education benefits.
Northrop Grumman,1e2j6h1onhbi7806,5.0,Northrup Grumman has been an ideal employer for me.  The benefits are wonderful.   The work atmosphere is very ideal.  I am compensated very well.  Love the cafeteria and they also have a very well equipped onsite gym.  Extremely clean building.
Northrop Grumman,1e2gtpb3j25cd003,4.0,"Combination of Linux, Windows Operating Systems.  Also, hardware and software installation and networking.  Terrific leaning environment.  Overall good experience."
Northrop Grumman,1e2f44f3fq5jp803,4.0,"NGIS was an amazing work environment. From management, to my constituent employees, everyone was an absolute pleasure to work for/with. The only recommendation I have is to baseline the hours you are able to work in a given period. Given the intense growth, combined with ever tightening deadlines, the work-life balance can get thrown very off. With that said, take time to speak with your management, and they will do everything possible to help assist in the management of your workload."
Northrop Grumman,1e2evnvj6hael803,5.0,I loved my time at Northrop Grumman  it was the best job I’ve ever had  . It offers great opportunities to learn and advance in your career at every step.

Northrop Grumman,1e2c69sv64t2b803,2.0,"Management was poor and most treated people as if they were stupid. They have alot of work for a few months and hire alot of people, then lay them off when the work is slow. Very high school atmosphere with gossipy cliques."
Northrop Grumman,1e2bpr8jiq5e6803,4.0,"Work was different hours, not 8-5.  Some days were 18 hours a day and only 30 minutes of work. It was boring and I didn't see a long future there.  Pay could have been a lot better."
Northrop Grumman,1e2bceklb4rij802,4.0,I cannot give any more detail. Thank you. Forcing this is not appropriate now is it? This section could have been made optional. And on a voluntary basis. thank you
Northrop Grumman,1e29c3n73hcau802,5.0,High demand work environment based on production needs. Management was very effective empathizing with the strenous demands through the use of morning meetings
Northrop Grumman,1e27r05f2oueg801,2.0,Provide training for managers especially new managers. They tend to throw new managers in management positions who are young and have never been a manager with no management training. Rules change per manager it seems
Northrop Grumman,1e274c3hghci7800,3.0,"Came in as a contractor, converted to an employee and my compensation dropped substantially (took a $5.00 pay cut) to convert to an employee NOT GOOD!"

Northrop Grumman,1e22evj6ooueg800,3.0,The good thing about this company is it can be flexible for work/life balance and offers good benefits. One negative thing is the company compensates external hires more highly than internal hires.
Northrop Grumman,1e1vq25qrbm8r802,4.0,"I liked the  day to day challenges, and friendships i have built there."
Northrop Grumman,1e1vh704volq3803,5.0,I had one of the best supervisors when I worked for Northrup Grumman. She never put limitations on your growth potential. she would encourage learning.
Northrop Grumman,1e1vfj5cto2j8802,5.0,"Excellent company.  Great benefits, love the support from management.  Very family oriented.  The only problem is the length of contracts.  Most jobs are located in the east and wesf coast."
Northrop Grumman,1e1un6udqolq3802,4.0,I enjoyed my time with Northrop but being a contractor your job can end at the drop of a hat. I'm just waiting for the hammer to drop and for them to send me home.
Northrop Grumman,1e1ulrv8725ia000,3.0,"Although work advancement is supported, there is massive chaos starting with reporting lines. This could, and most likely would, result in the employee directly reporting to someone offsite who they do not know and seldom see. It leads to confusion as to who is giving direction and who has authority. The amount of chaos is driving employees out and leads to many tasks being dropped especially when positions are not re-filled."
Northrop Grumman,1e1uc2ouhhbgo802,5.0,Cutting edge military technology  Space innovations  two annual bonuses already  Superior benefits over all the other companies I’ve worked for   Hard fast paced work for serious professionals  Veteran friendly dinners and recognition
Northrop Grumman,1e1sq43fubm8r801,5.0,Worked to automate the process of reworking circuit boards for satellites as a capstone project for my senior year at UCSB. Our contacts at Northrop Grumman were great resources for the project and connections afterwards.
Northrop Grumman,1e1rfl5fcolq3801,4.0,We have a pretty good team atmosphere.  There is a sense of belonging.  I have had the opportunity to work with different systems and projects.  It is nice to have travellled to so many different place.
Northrop Grumman,1e1ql4r0525ia002,1.0,Stay away from this place. What is this? I don't want to fill this out; indeed sucks as well. Northrop Grumman is not what I was expecting; false advertisement.
Northrop Grumman,1e1q5snh025ia002,4.0,What it says on the tin.
Northrop Grumman,1e1pcba32hd6k803,4.0,Highly skilled workers some people are friendly while others are not . Remain focus and give it your all. I was a contractor there. Alot of modification to Aircraft.

Northrop Grumman,1e1nn113vo90t802,5.0,"Management interacts well with staff, typical day starts up fast, especially in the morning. Having a café and lounge for all to access is a complement for this company."
Northrop Grumman,1e1mns397f0a5802,5.0,"Management offers the chance for advancement. Flexible workplace. For the most part, you will remain busy all day. Friendly coworkers and a family atmosphere."
Northrop Grumman,1e1l8r15tq59h802,3.0,"Typical big company experience. If you were aligned with the right supervisor, things went well. Depending on the project, you could do well or not. I'm not a big company person."
Northrop Grumman,1e1kjbbbnhd6k803,4.0,"I enjoyed my workload and my work schedule.  The toughest part was dealing with the different people that were very unreceptive to change.  I was in the military for a long time and its hard for me to deal with people that don't have self-motivation.  It is only a few people but it is those few that can change dynamics of a team.  But all in all, we still got the job done."
Northrop Grumman,1e1kgheklbm8r801,3.0,"Like all Aerospace companies they are constantly re-inventing themselves. I don't always like what they come up with, but the management is cognizant about their place in the DOD market and is trying to be a Top Performer. Their history is as an Integrator of Aerospace Systems and Platforms and they are constantly sending the message that the future is not like the past. Everyone needs to keep bettering themselves to make a difference. I've worked at eight (8) Aerospace companies in my career and NGC is about as good as you will find in the industry."
Northrop Grumman,1e1kft9e8q59h802,4.0,NG is a dynamic and diverse place to work.  Culture and way of doing business is always challenged to ensure we are meeting our customer where they are and when they need us.
Northrop Grumman,1e1k5itcho90u801,3.0,NG allows movement for career growth and supports employee development. Me and so many other talented people left because of bad location (CA). I would go back in a heartbeat but not to CA.
Northrop Grumman,1ebfcse9urcsp800,5.0,"An amazing company, understands the military and provides a great culture. I would love to work the rest of my life at the company. They will help you with obtaining your goals and leave you in a good place for retirement."
Northrop Grumman,1e1i8fv8u316p003,4.0,Good company with a large portfolio of programs.  Competitive benefits.  Company continues to grow and expand product offerings.  Traditional defense industry work environment.
Northrop Grumman,1e1i7ghs025ia002,2.0,"Work load was so heavy during my time at NG that I managed one vacation in 5 years (additional vacation requests were denied due to no back-up).  I regularly worked 85-95 hour pay periods (with no compensation for hours over 80).  Additional tasking was added to my workload with no additional compensation, and when I pushed back I was told I was lucky to have a job and I wouldn't have a job for much longer if I refused the additional work."
Northrop Grumman,1e1hk2qq2316p001,5.0,People are great.  Job and hours are exceptional.  Pay is good for the job and location.  Benefits are great. People work to complete the task and work together well.
Northrop Grumman,1e1g7iedmhctm802,4.0,Working 9 hour days Monday-Thursday is great because you get every other Friday off. The on-Friday is only an 8 hour day. This gives you flexibility of 3-day weekends half of the year!
Northrop Grumman,1e1ft73p5f0a5802,2.0,Good people to work with. Management is good nice place to work at. Multiple locations. Northrop Grumman is a large company and can move around if necessary.
Northrop Grumman,1e1fi66vphc27803,4.0,As a company as a whole its a great place to work but there is not that much room to advance. The company tends to promote people that come from the outside instead of within and that the downside of working there.
Northrop Grumman,1e1fb9r3fhd6k801,2.0,"The management, with a few exceptions, has an elitist mindset. They expect you to know exactly the same things they do and if you don't, they look down on you and either give you busy work that has nothing to do with your job, or they pass you over for any work."
Northrop Grumman,1e1ej5uhcouer803,4.0,Northrop Grumman acquired Orbital ATK a year and a half ago and they are still working through the transition to the Northrop way of doing things. The procurement team has a diverse mix of great of people.
Northrop Grumman,1e1e18ohuf0a5802,2.0,"Not very flexible. They claim to offer education assistance for grad school but getting funding over 10k per year is near impossible. Managers don't take interest in how employees feel or their personal life, it just about the bottom line."
Northrop Grumman,1e1ccimm4hc27803,4.0,I  worked with great people.  They are intelligent and great team players.  We were able to work together to solve problems and accomplish our goals on the projects.
Northrop Grumman,1e1a33dj4hd5d804,5.0,I felt most of the employees wanted to come to work and wanted to do a good job for the company and the customer.  NGC was a great place to work for the most part.
Northrop Grumman,1e17qloibf39u803,5.0,Good work flow. Consistent supervision updates on jobs. Daily meetings with management in the morning before work starts. Ability to learn several different processes every other day.
Northrop Grumman,1e178o15po8v0802,2.0,"Many projects give limited time to complete, forcing overtime to be done. Benefits are removed frequently. Sick time taken away, forced to use vacation. Vacation time taken away. Higher education support reduced. Health insurance continually becoming more and more expensive, 10x more expensive in 4 years. No more bonuses for hard work."
Northrop Grumman,1e164lo01oue0803,5.0,NG has a very stable environment for employees who want to learn and grow their careers.  The best company I have ever worked for.  I would highly recommend working at NG.
Northrop Grumman,1e1632a8nhcjq802,4.0,The company makes attempts to listen to its employees and tries to engage them in making it a better place to work. Some say with mixed results but at least they are making the effort.
Northrop Grumman,1e14v1e6f38ng001,3.0,"Overall, the company isn't that bad. Culure is clickly, managers are hit and miss and they are stretched thin on tasks, the pay sucks. I was in finance/business management and my salary sucked. I referred a friend into the engineering group and his salary didn't match the work he was doing. I had few other friends in different areas who too had lower than average salaries."
Northrop Grumman,1e105h4s3hc11803,3.0,"It is well understood among those in the management ranks that females and African Americans are given such preference for promotions to director and above that white males often need not apply, even when their education, experience, past performance, and other qualifications makes them unquestionably the best candidate.  All management employees with enough time at the company can give many examples where this has occurred.  As a result of not selecting the best candidates for upper management and executive roles for the last 5-10 years, the competency level at those ranks has dropped precipitously.  I no longer consider Northrop Grumman a well managed company because the number of incompetent directors and vice presidents has risen to the point in which they are a significant portion of the total."
Northrop Grumman,1e0vpg11uo8v0805,4.0,"The contract I was on had a horrible assistant project manager, and the mid level management suffered from it greatly. I understand a company as a whole cannot be fairly judged on one person's performance, and as I do not hold Northrop as a whole accountable for that, I do hold the management above him that kept him in place accountable.  Northrop is a wonderful company, and their projects are admirable, but that APM was horrid."
Northrop Grumman,1e0udg9n1f39u802,4.0,Multiple programs allow plenty of room to move around the company and gain new experiences and lots of opportunity to move up to roles of greater responsibility.
Northrop Grumman,1e0ts9djcq5jl803,3.0,"All my coworkers made for a fun environment. As for as learning goes, it does get stale and lots of delay between each task which wasn't fun for me because I like to be kept busy. Hardworking manager but feel like tasks could be delegated a little better."
Northrop Grumman,1ebfcse9urcsp800,5.0,"An amazing company, understands the military and provides a great culture. I would love to work the rest of my life at the company. They will help you with obtaining your goals and leave you in a good place for retirement."
Northrop Grumman,1e0tonp2cq5jl801,5.0,Great Opportunity but long time team members lacked College Degrees while their job required that they have one. Lack of communication within the department I was in.
Northrop Grumman,1e0teppmahajd804,2.0,"You have to be an engineer to really matter in this company. The pace in this place is typical; 9-5 and nothing exciting ever happens. The place claims to care for their employee's, but when it comes to regular employee's who are not engineers; the management sure make it hard to move forward."
Northrop Grumman,1e0rabti7ol2h803,3.0,"Some of the previous nature of Orbital still exists and is slow to change.  Bur we are in a new building and some changes although slowly are happening,"

Northrop Grumman,1e0h82mijblr4803,5.0,The hardest part of the job is travel. This job requires about 17 weeks of travel every year. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with soldiers and my peers.
Northrop Grumman,1e0ghsi4d2v48003,4.0,"Overall, Northrop Grumman is a good employer. The salary and benefits are competitive and they are sincere about having work-life balance.  Employee turnover seems to be reducing cutting into legacy work culture. Work with some fine people."
Northrop Grumman,1e0f40hfiol2h803,2.0,"Northrop Grumman is an older company, so with that comes a lot of paperwork, processes, red tape, and slow changes. On the other hand, management makes their best effort to provide lots of career opportunities for all employees."
Northrop Grumman,1e0e231gcblr4803,4.0,"The company offered a 9/80 work schedule, which is great. They offer flexible work hours and telecommuting. There are layers of bureaucracy in management which makes it difficult to enact change. The most enjoyable part of the job is working on the incredible projects and programs."
Northrop Grumman,1e0di01m2hctt806,4.0,"See above. We were always waiting for the next contact, which I understand is not uncommon in the airspace and defense sector. I enjoyed the people very much."

Highly motivated and dedicated with a commitment to create and maintain a safe working environment."
Northrop Grumman,1e0c28hekhctt803,2.0,"I think ""fun"" would be the last word to describe the office culture of NGC. It's very conservative and formal.  Old school perspectives and traditional ways of thinking are prominent."
Northrop Grumman,1e0botslaq45d801,3.0,"Has ups and downs. Very little stress most of the time, but little incentive to do more than required. Working for the military also comes with a hit to your conscious."

Northrop Grumman,1e0be43qaq5ia802,3.0,Limited time there not as an employee. Different view on how the company is. For the most part everything is fine and is dependent on the individual working there. It's a good option overall.
Northrop Grumman,1e0bbln38ol2h804,1.0,i currently work for them at northdrop gruman and it is horrible and truly disorganized on a massive scale currently my schedule is 6 days a week with 9 to 10 hr days with a 5am call time and they use the fact that your a temp to take advantage of you

Northrop Grumman,1e082olg2obp4801,5.0,There are times where you feel that the company doesn't really care about you. It can be very demanding physically. There used to be a lot of room for advancement and growth but they have stopped that and now it is very difficult to go up in the company.
Northrop Grumman,1e07av25uoufr803,5.0,People are smart and easy to work with. The scrum master is very understanding of when you take time off and almost always get approved when you have doctor appointment or anything.
Northrop Grumman,1e06oaurq0jfj002,4.0,"I was shoved in last minute, so I don't blame them for me not having much to do. I spent most of my time making sure things were up to date on spreadsheets and doodling on sticky notes. Paid well though."
Northrop Grumman,1e06ha66vobp3802,4.0,"Northrop Grumman has many good things about it. Very consistantly work, mostly competitive pay, ok opportunity to advance. I left because I maxed out the pay for my position and they said I was not eligible to promote for over a year."

Northrop Grumman,1e03eetck38bs003,1.0,I saw security people violate security policies. HR NEVER does their jobs. I was assaulted by a supervisor and told to not report it by another person in management. Everyone is hired via nepotism and management is chosen in a similar fashion. Internal investigations are an incompetent joke. Discrimination and racism are normalized. They screwed up my security clearance. They literally nag low level people about timecard fraud while people with seniority spend all day on Facebook in the same cubefarm. Selective policy enforcement is the norm. Theft is a regular occurrence.
Northrop Grumman,1dvvmneqk4t1h801,4.0,Fair and rewarding and very fast paced work environment.  Management needs more skill in helping employees to achieve there goal. Job and contracting company have break down in communication.

Northrop Grumman,1dvufdprcosop806,5.0,"I got the job through a Temporary , it was a good job , I love working there , It gave me great experience and show me different things.

Northrop Grumman,1dvu2tr3io1og800,5.0,I worked for Northrop Grumman as a contractor. They are a well-organized company with competitive pay and good benefits. They know how to take care of employees.
Northrop Grumman,1ebfcse9urcsp800,5.0,"An amazing company, understands the military and provides a great culture. I would love to work the rest of my life at the company. They will help you with obtaining your goals and leave you in a good place for retirement."
Northrop Grumman,1dvtq6gdjhcij803,5.0,"Loved everyday I went to work. I felt included, accepted, challenged, and successful. The only thing that anyone could say negative is the pay vs. the cost of living. I  think if they want to keep the head hunters at bay, a bump in pay would be good."
Northrop Grumman,1dvteur46o1vl803,1.0,Sr management treats employees as expendable resources to be used up and discarded rather than as assets. They embrace the mindset that beatingsshould continue until morale improves.
Northrop Grumman,1dvs6uvo0bmlg802,5.0,"Worked there more than 25 years, enjoyed the technical challenges and work environment.  Travel opportunities, multiple programs, good work culture, southern California."
Northrop Grumman,1dvrv7fa3q3n1803,5.0,Someone who enjoys solving problems for a customers and giving back to the mission.  A career intelligence officer who served in the USA and other government agencies in support of national objectives.
Northrop Grumman,1dvrsum0h47np803,4.0,I learned mostly about security and maintaining company based protocols. The workplace was fun but professional with management not being overbearing unless you just weren't doing your work.
Northrop Grumman,1dvrrjruublms803,3.0,The company seems to focus more on diversity and continuous turnover rather than balance and value of their senior level employees. Continuous organizational restructuring due to diversity incentives such as female leadership and younger less experienced technical work force has caused the company to fail on meeting milestone commitments. Although the company advertises and promotes diversity unfortunately this has become an internal morale problem as the senior experienced employees are no longer valued and often incentivesed to retire or seek employment outside of the company.
Northrop Grumman,1dvq0p228p41a803,4.0,"Large refresh project, interesting environment. Helps to have a security clearance. Some areas are classified. Nice employee outings for Holidays , barbeques etc..."

Northrop Grumman,1dvpr0hakbmlf803,4.0,"All depends on what program you work for, some programs have tons of overtime mandatory and old tech, while others are totally the opposite. Culture is you have to switch roles to get promoted."
Northrop Grumman,1dvpd9smqo1og804,1.0,"Everyone at Northrop has perfect job security (they won't fire someone unless they mess up really bad).  As a result, everyone slowly realized that they didn't have to do their job well since there is no risk to their career and no additional reward for going above and beyond.  This is not a good employer for active-thinkers or people who like to improvise.  Creativity and challenging the status quo are discouraged, though not openly.  Perfect place for someone who's at the end of their career and just needs some healthcare for a bit."
Northrop Grumman,1dvp93oeioaqc801,5.0,Very laid back in the program space I worked in. Management was awesome and there was plenty of help for career advancement and training. I would definitely consider going back to work for them!
Northrop Grumman,1dvp268dbhbii803,3.0,Good Salary
Northrop Grumman,1dvovpccco1vl803,5.0,"Most of the leads know what there doing, most days it feels as if all they care about is how many job cards are closed and not as must as the quaity of work"
Northrop Grumman,1dvnoc731nrfd803,4.0,"Northrop used to have a pension, no more.  They are a huge company.  Not a lot of training support there.  Some areas are a lot better than others.  I don't recommend working there to start your career."
Northrop Grumman,1dvnhd8voblvk801,5.0,Support to network defense with an eight hour day with some supervisory work. I have learned to monitor networks in real-time while producing status reports and keeping leadership informed of changes. The culture is great with informal dress and an upbeat communication across the work stations. The hardest part of the job is the slow work volume at night which is not as exciting as the beginning of the shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is reacting to time-sensitive threats on the network.
Northrop Grumman,1dvmprp8j4p1l803,4.0,No complaints an outstanding company to work with and for. Many sectors allow for transition given the required skills. Availability to excel in your career and personal life.
Northrop Grumman,1dvmc8v0fo1hc801,4.0,"Great place to work,  just like any other job,  had its ups and downs... schedule is a big concern.  Company expects too many units to be completed in little time. More emphasis on quality needed"
Northrop Grumman,1dvl9hdku4p1l802,4.0,"The company did a great job improving processes, best practices and training employees. There were growing pains but they pushed hard to create standard practices which made designing flow much smoother across various subsystems. However, Management's expectations were unrealistic and mandated overtime to accomplish release goals which were not possible."
Northrop Grumman,1dvkp0neunh7m802,4.0,Fair pay. Progressive culture. Flexible hours with some telework options. Many different potential projects for you to work on. Management is very easy to approach.

Northrop Grumman,1duqc99qpf0sh802,4.0,"Overall, Northrop Grumman is your average defense contractor with a similar work culture you'll find at Lockheed, Raytheon, and all others. Besides the high-end tech, what really stood out to me were the makerspaces (AKA FabLab) provided by the company. These were spaces for employees to collaborate and build anything they'd like. Northrop provided all sorts of tools and equipment and was constantly adding more stuff just so employees can continue to experiment and express their creative selves."
Northrop Grumman,1dunrotp7o9vn803,4.0,"Northrop Grumman is a good outfit. ... In any case, Northrop is a career company. If you can work for them, it will not always be fun and there will be a fair measure of internal bureaucracy but it's going to be a forever job if you want it. And you can advance internally."
Northrop Grumman,1dunldf44old9803,1.0,Bottom line I think they suck as an organization as a whole..  They out source their services and do not have close interpersonal relationships with their employees.  This is a very disconnected company.
Northrop Grumman,1dundn9pd25jq003,4.0,"The postal service is never happy no matter what and constantly changing policies and procedures .  Northrop management is inconsistent, there seems to be no common standard to follow . some managers get away with too much unprofessional behavior."

Northrop Grumman,1duic9eaeo9ru803,5.0,"I have been at this company for 20 years. They look out for their people. I have noticed a recent trend of hiring those right out of college.  This is how NG keeps their costs down. They are good, but they are expensive. This helps offset that.  However, they easily get rid of those that have been there for years because their salary starts getting up there. They haven't always chosen the best leaders. Senior leadership is great, but lower level leadership needs improvement.  Overall, I am very happy with NG."
Northrop Grumman,1duic4mgoov22802,3.0,"I love what I do and the company as a whole, but the department management is ridiculous. There are promises made for change and nothing done; no one is held accountable and it puts a bad taste in your mouth when you work as hard as you do."

Northrop Grumman,1du9cqemghe31801,3.0,"Been with NG for almost 5 year. I'm not impressed with their management style. Working on a customer site, you're very disconnected from headquarters, so have the time you don't know what's going on the company."

Northrop Grumman,1du78g375nouj802,4.0,"Was a great place to work, however being denied a security clearance made it a dead end for me. Was over looked for advancement despite my work qualifications. However, I should have stuck it out instead of putting in my notice."

The hardest part of this job was dealing with Management's micromanaging and doing the same thing day in day out.

Most enjoyable part was some of the people I worked with or met through working in different areas."

A typical day at work...high stress and busy from the time you enter until departure, which is great as it helps time pass. Training was interesting, could use some structure.

The most enjoyable part...departing daily."

Northrop Grumman,1dt075lg6had1803,1.0,"When I joined, this facility was at least 25 years out of date on current software processes. Software, although the largest group there, gets little respect and doesn't get to control their own projects. Project Mgmt runs everything and if it isn't being paid for by the customer, it doesn't get done. Software does not get to enact process improvements unless a customer agrees to pay for it... so it never happens."

The business slowed down after about a year and a half and was moved from my original position to another department.  Immediately started looking for another company as layoffs were in the near future."

Northrop Grumman,1drtmtj3s5j4g801,1.0,"If you have no job experience this is company for you. They provide you the entire world and look good on your resume with big company. Managers have no skills set except just send daily reminder to do timesheet. Corp events were silly too they provide nothing and want employees to bring foods and drinks. My project where managers were clueless and clients just bypass them. Also, corporate culture was bad too which bring morale down"

Love the 9/80 schedule with every other Friday off.  Very security minded for obvious reasons.  The iReturn program, originally conceived by the Society of Women engineers, is a great opportunity for older, very-experienced, talented engineers and technical/administrative folks to get a ""second-shot"" at resuming their career after an extended absence for a wide variety of reasons."

Northrop Grumman,1dr6u7bn61d12002,5.0,"Great company to work for; politics and micro management culture has finally changed or disappeared. As compared to other defense contractors, Northrop Grumman remains professional and dedicated to helping their employees grow with the right tools as well as culture or projects long term. No fly by night work or ""buzz word"" tech world culture or whats hot culture to only fizzle out.  Long term, steady work in many projects is what this company offers."
Northrop Grumman,1dr4t8geo24gi003,3.0,There are lots of locations to work in. It may be hard to transfer between divisions. Many people use it as a stepping stone to another company due to a minimum raise to keep up with the economy and level of experience.

Northrop Grumman,1dr2dl6mhb8br802,3.0,"I work for the research facilitation lab in Monterey as a Northrop employee.

Northrop Grumman,1dquihuuvh3qo802,4.0,"For the most part this is a great job.  Good pay and benefits, paid vacation, and on sight security does a good job of keeping everything under control when needed.  Schedules kinda suck as you never know if your going to have to pull overtime generally until last minute, which can be a drag with planning family/friend get togethers or having a life outside work.  But if your like me and hungry for money, most times there is more than enough overtime in one department or another that you can sign up with.  The worst part of the job is lack of communication from the top down to area managers and lack of communication between departments."
Northrop Grumman,1dquhfr6g5ne3801,5.0,"NGC is a great place to work. Unfortunately, I had some personal issues that prevented me from working there until I retire (which was my plan all along). Great long term outlook and great campus."

Northrop Grumman,1dqrk2h0kh3ul802,4.0,Beat company I’ve worked for!  Give you plenty of time for training. The co workers were the only downside to it. They were too intimidated and wouldn’t help you at all. They’d turn their back while watching you struggle. They like to start rumors like we were in High School.
Northrop Grumman,1dqplfs1ch3qo803,5.0,Awesome work environment fantastic benefits DTO AND PTO WOW  support to succeed and room for advancement.  To Bad we didn’t get the new contract and I could not move with them.
Northrop Grumman,1dqmcqlsf5ndt803,3.0,"When you interview with a manager you like but get assigned to an unprofessional supervisor who tells dirty jokes in a macho/retired military environment, it’s never pleasant. Luckily, there was flex-time, so mostly everyone started by 7 AM and left by 2 or 3 PM so I could start at 8:30 and work alone in peace to lock up at 5. The other contract technical writer was hyper competitive and lied to the team about my citizenship and my being undocumented to chip away at trust."
Northrop Grumman,1dqkjgq8dh42h803,4.0,Good company to work for. Limited advancement opportunity. Great benefits including education assistance. Would work for again in a different  department.
Northrop Grumman,1dqk226svh42h803,2.0,"I loved the job, loved the pay, but the management and culture there was poor. Morale was low because of how mismanaged it is there. One week you would be so far behind that they would work you 60 hours then the next week they would mysteriously be ahead  of pitch and tell you to slow down and take your time, only to express displeasure at you doing just that."
Northrop Grumman,1ebfcse9urcsp800,5.0,"An amazing company, understands the military and provides a great culture. I would love to work the rest of my life at the company. They will help you with obtaining your goals and leave you in a good place for retirement."

Northrop Grumman,1dq795grgh3mq803,4.0,I would cut down the favoritism. Seniority is not important anymore. That is one of the many reasons that I left. Confidentiality is a must but management can't seem to keep things professional.
Northrop Grumman,1dq722c9rh3id802,4.0,"My experience at NG was positive. I felt like I grew there, seems like every job has it's moments of pressure and stress. But NG has a open door policy for the most part."

Northrop Grumman,1dpru6av0brf1802,4.0,I fully enjoyed working at Northrop Grumman.  I learned many different things from subcontracts to auditing to other government requirements.  The people there are the most enjoyable part of the job.
Northrop Grumman,1dpr30dlhh3q5802,4.0,"I really like that I have various tasks throughout the day, as this pushes me toward positive growth and improvement upon skills and knowledge (not to mention, this makes for seemingly quick shifts). However, there is an overall culture of angst and hurry that comes from this collective consciousness of ""being behind"" in one goal or the next. Thankfully, my coworkers and managers are accommodating, helpful, and easy to work with. The benefits, pay, and hours are great as well, which shows how much Northrop Grumman does value its employees despite the sometimes heavy-laden demands of the day. Overall, this is a great company that offers any employee the opportunity to grow and advance in his/her career field, providing a path to grow in skill and pay."
Northrop Grumman,1dpo5idb652tr802,3.0,"Presented Control M to me. A  Job Scheduling tool used with Northrup Gruman to operate their daily workflow. Operations was going through a lot of changes, which kept a lot of employees on each about the contract with the government, which eventually ended."
Northrop Grumman,1dpntd001b87i802,4.0,"Many qualified team members, little cooperation.  Most work in the DBA/Developer group was done individually.  The BA team worked as a group and facilitated the team efforts by explaining how tasks could be best performed."
Northrop Grumman,1dplg18d552tr800,4.0,Northrop Grumman is a great company to work for. The only problem I faced was not having promotion opportunities because of my position. As the building chief engineer. unfortunately there were not any opportunities for me to grow.

Northrop Grumman,1dpld2lgeh3i7802,3.0,"Bad management. Hard wall between managers and employees. Many personnel have no real world experience with the products, but they read a book. No need to apply if your over 40. Below the surface age discrimination on advancement."
Northrop Grumman,1dpl95i5t5ndh802,4.0,"It was good job. Downside was benefits like vacation. Had to work full year to get just 5 days of PTO. I’ve heard they’ve loosened reigns of culture since. Such as now you can have camera phone in workplace. Parking in morning to get to work was insane. 20,000 employees yo would think they’d have more than enough parking with all the money they make. Not the case. I actually loved my crew. A second family."
Northrop Grumman,1dpl76au452tr802,3.0,I had a great experience working at the office site for the client.  Management didn't really try to get to know the staff that worked at the clients office.  If you weren't at corporate you were forgotten.
Northrop Grumman,1dpjn0sm9h423802,2.0,"the job itself is not hard. it is quiet interesting, but management is a joke! they treat their employees horrible. if you don't clique up with the right people, you're out of a job."
Northrop Grumman,1dpis6egoh3q2802,5.0,"If my circumstances were different, I would still be working at NG. They are an awesome company. They truly care about the employee. I was there for almost 4 years and can say that I literally cried when I had to leave."
Northrop Grumman,1dphi0ejc52to801,4.0,I learned a lot about supply chain in the national defense industry. The most enjoyable part of the job is the employees. I've also enjoyed the different activities that were provided for interns.
Northrop Grumman,1dph6o1v7h3md802,3.0,"I liked the work, the people, and the pay wasn't bad. I didn't care for the overarching feel that I was always being watched though. There seemed to be a new rule every week changing how I had to do my work but any ideas I had about how things might have been made better were met with indifference or just ignored."
Northrop Grumman,1dpgv2vqmh3i3803,5.0,I am retired from NG.  I spent 10 years with the company in CA and believe that it was and still is a great place to work.  My primary place of work was in Flight Test.  Management was great and everyone within Flight Test was easy to work with.
Northrop Grumman,1dpgte310breu802,5.0,I enjoyed working at Northrop Grumman my supervisor was very helpful and I learned a lot and the training was good.The hours were good and was nice to work overtime at times.

Northrop Grumman,1dpg9gbbl5j5c802,1.0,Working personnel not personable and unwillingly to extend themselves in training other to perform duties.  Too busy for adequate training.
Northrop Grumman,1dpdq0lf7h41o800,4.0,Great place to work.  Great culture with hard working and dedicated teams of people delivering on national security and defense missions for the US Military and its allies.
Northrop Grumman,1dp6dd7q95nd3801,3.0,Benefits and pay are competitive but retention is low. Doesn't seem to retain valuable talent or match outside offers. Has a huge variance in management teams. Compliance is obscure and there is no solid on the job training. Corporate is striving for more work life balance but it does not flow down through the sectors that way. How I am able to support in a civilian fashion while no longer able to wear the uniform is my favorite part of the job. The constant revision of forms and the inconsistency in compliance personnel are beyond frustrating.
Northrop Grumman,1dp3atmokh3tn802,5.0,"The culture of Northrop Grumman impressed me, everyone was very social yet productive. The work challenged me and encouraged me to grow as an individual. The work that I was given added value to the company from day one, and I was able to be involved in several different areas. The people and type of work we were doing were both great. The structure and mission of the company was reflected by the high quality of product they produced and how supportive the entire system was top to bottom."
Northrop Grumman,1dp255hjpbreg802,5.0,"Great people to work with, learning curve allowed, OJT, mentored and supervision was limited as long as they can see you know what you are doing and minimal complaints."
Northrop Grumman,1dp20mae05j53802,2.0,"The culture at Northrop is by far the biggest downside of the company. There are many employees that simply lack ambition. This definitely comes from the culture of moving people around and not firing anyone, even when there have been multiple HR complaints about a specific employee. There were many times when the few ambitious employees would have to do double the work to make up for under-performing employees. This does translate nicely for the work life balance at Northrop. No one will mind if you have to leave in the middle of the day."
Northrop Grumman,1dp1dibs15n93804,4.0,"The environment was very professional. Processes are very rigorous, as is attention to getting details right. Quality assurance on programs very tight. Capture reviews are very detail oriented. Shipley-based capture methodology very comprehensive."
Northrop Grumman,1dp0kakmdh3m3804,4.0,"I did not beleieve that bullying really happened in the work place.  I was horribly mistaken! This was by far the worst professional experience in my life. I was constantly put down and was told things like ""you can't be as naive to think anyone here likes you"". That's just one example.  There were so many more."
Northrop Grumman,1dovh4b2ah3pn804,4.0,"I would definitely recommend seeking employment with Northrop Grumman. I thoroughly enjoyed my work, it was very satisfying and I was excited to go to work each day."

Northrop Grumman,1dos3idmdb8ai802,3.0,as with any job. The best part is the interesting and compelling projects. The worst part is the bureaucracy and hoops you have to jump through to get anything done.
Northrop Grumman,1dos13fmnbre9800,3.0,"Day-to-day workload depends on which program you are working for. You could be really busy, or you could be sitting around twiddling your thumbs.

Northrop Grumman,1dohfva10b86l807,4.0,"As a contracts intern, the typical work day was centered around the work desktop managing various different contract database tasks. One of the main tasks I was given during my brief time at Northrop was to fill up a new online database for veteran employees to have more immediate access to the files they required. This work essentially required nothing more than renaming every file and folder to fit within a certain naming convention, before uploading individual folders to the database. This went on for multiple months as the central task under my purview. It was far from glamorous, but the people were so kind and welcoming and always happy to help. There was likely a path for progressing beyond simple tasks like that, but the work was not for me in particular. Still, very warm work environment."

However, the issues I had with the organization is due to the ex-military mind-set. Because of this mentality a few managers treated employees as soldiers. They ignored or intentionally misinterpreted the labor laws of Saudi Arabia that applied to all employees. Fortunately, I worked under supervisors who took care of their subordinates.."

You also after your 6 month probation period start to recruit PTO every paycheck & can begin to use it. Also after your probationary period you have chances to bid on different jobs with higher pay. Though like most jobs still had its cons; When I was leaving a new manager came in on a power trip and was changing everything. There’s A LOT of overtime which if you like money is great but it is hard to keep a social life outside of work. Another thing that is tricky is their point system.

Overtime hours will quickly become the metric for how much value you're providing the company and will directly impact your promotion and career opportunities.

Northrop Grumman,1dk1irbjbbre4802,4.0,Despite it's business and corporate aesthetic. The company was really good to its employees and the workers were very friendly and professional. It was a drama free environment. Since being a contractor it was a bit difficult to maintain projects if proposed projects didn't pull through.

If you have a position with one of the technically focused, integrated and functional divisions, I suspect it will be a great job. I did not -- and it was a very rough and miserable 3.5 years. The division made a conscious decision to back the local project manager despite evidence to the contrary because the customer ""loved""him. Ethically challenged, reactionary, and secretive it made my job impossible. One of the folks at the Division HQ told me after I was encouraged to resign because they wanted to go a different way, ""It was a thankless position and utterly unfair. This is better for you.""

Level 4 critiques you're work and make you feel so defeated because nothing is ever perfect. Manager doesnt know how to keep work steady. He rushed to get things through every week and ran us right out of work. They fired a girl who went into labor early. Tells how much this company really cares about you.

In the high performing part of the company management is fair and they genuinely care about all employees.  If it wasn't a good place to work, it wouldn't be a successful company.  In the foundry however, politics is all that matters.  Total incompetence gets rewarded because it is executed by someone who knows which wheels to grease and projects struggle to move forward.  That said, if your expertise is in fabrication and TD you can find plenty of opportunities outside of the foundry once you connect to a few people outside."

From what I've seen, it's a toss up as to what the environment, management, funding, and experience are all like.  Since it is a defense contractor, you are subject to whatever contracts your department/location is awarded.  This can heavily affect your experience.

Northrop Grumman,1dgjcrcq052tu800,1.0,"Hands down, Northrop Grumman Orlando is the worst place I've ever worked. It is the epitome of  a toxic work environment. The work/employee company culture leaves much to be desired. Management/Leadership is atrocious. They do not care about their employees. Employees are undervalued, underpaid, and unappreciated. Did I mention significantly underpaid? The facility has been plagued with rats, roaches, ants, bats, mold, roof leaks, flooding, broken office furniture, boxes blocking aisles and passageways, fire hazards, OSHA Hazard. It has been an absolute disgrace. The Business Unit embraces diversity from the top but it ends there. NG Discovery Drive is lead and managed by The Good 'Ol Boys/Brotherhood. Female Engineers are continuously disrespected and maltreated. HR is ineffective and absolutely useless. It is unorganized. No process for anything. It takes jumping through 10 flaming hoops to get anything done. It is ran like a starter upper company rather than a multi-billion dollar Enterprise Defense Corporation. I would not recommend this location to my worse enemy. There is NO loyalty. It is a cut throat backstabbing environment. The second you leave a room, people/ team members will slander you just to elevate themselves. Attrition has been extremely high here over the past year for a reason."

There are all types of people there with different backgrounds, different cultures and management needs to accept that, not everybody is going to be the same.  The most enjoyable part of working there is how different people are from one another. Employee's are great people.  Management thinks that because every one that works there they all should be the same.  Different people have different cultures and Management needs to understand not every one is the same."

Northrop Grumman,1dg8istiv24fc000,4.0,"The work was interesting because we got to handle high profile projects, but because they were all government contracts, there was sometimes crippling restrictions on processes and what software/tools we were allowed to use to get the job done. The flip side of that is that everything moved at the pace of government work. Most of the time it was fairly low pressure, but every once in a while there would be a time crunch. Overall, it's a nice place to work, but just get used to lots of restrictions."
Northrop Grumman,1dg62nimc5ncl800,4.0,"Worked there for 10 plus years, My only complaint was the massive layoffs they would conduct on senior employees. With years of service. Wish they would treat employees like family and not cogs in a wheel."

Northrop Grumman,1dfu3s9fo24e4000,4.0,"The overall feel of the workplace was very corporate and cold, but there were amenities available that helped to keep people engaged. The job itself could be both rewarding and challenging depending on the call volume and how much you were micro-managed. Individualism wasn't valued as much as falling in line with what management wanted and getting your numbers. Working with people of different backgrounds and networking with people in other areas of expertise was a positive benefit."
Northrop Grumman,1dfsc8r3o0mth000,5.0,"Its an amazing company to work for but i working there as a contractor. I wish there was enough budget to keep workers like myself with no active clearance there. I enjoyed my co workers that i worked with and supervisors. The job duties, being exposed and able to learn and take on newer tasks that was not in my job description. Northrop Grumman is a place where you can definitely advance in positions if funds were available for contractors. The work culture is awesome and i would definitely come back to work for the company if offered a position. According to current employees the benefits are amazing."
Northrop Grumman,1dfs2d4v31d01003,5.0,"Moved to Seattle where no NGC offices were available.  Always felt engaged, challenged, paid fairly well, with great benefits, and my office was close to home."
Northrop Grumman,1dfr88m1224g1000,4.0,This is not as stressful as other companies. They are family oriented and very understanding. You can have your phone with you as long as you get your job completed.
Northrop Grumman,1dfpgfd8924f1000,5.0,I loved working here. The corporate culture is really fun and inclusive. The people are awesome to work with and knowledgeable in their fields. Would recommend for a serious look.
Northrop Grumman,1dfmlgtl024f1000,5.0,Typical day at work is very busy and demanding.  Enjoy working with co-workers and upper management.  I've learned more about time management and brushed on ERP skills.
Northrop Grumman,1dfkb1rip24f1000,4.0,Not a bad place to work. Average work environment to slightly hectic. Plan to work a lot of hours. Management can be difficult as it changes frequently.
Northrop Grumman,1dfjfqf0e1d0h000,4.0,"At the end of the day, you can see progress in your day's work.  Every one in your department is like family,"
Northrop Grumman,1dfj6fu6o0mth004,5.0,"It's a great place to work although it was ATK when I was hired, which makes my review better than it should be. Northrop came in and changed role titles advancement structure pay and time off, so the management came from there. If it wasn't for that than not so much."
Northrop Grumman,1dfhpq52e24fh000,5.0,"Great place to work. Was a contractor for government working in Intelligence discipline in Washington, D.C. Great psy and benefits. Freedom to work independently."
Northrop Grumman,1dfh7gc1g0mch000,3.0,I worked for NG for over 8 years. Began my career with TASC and NGIT. Loved it!
Northrop Grumman,1dfgm6jbu24gh000,5.0,"Northrop (NGC) does not lay off. I repeat . . . Northrop does not do layoffs. Layoffs are extremely rare within the company and nowadays, if they do layoffs it is after the company offered employees lots of options to move to another program that they turned down. As far as benefits they are comparable to every other major company in the industry, but I feel that NGC values their employees a lot more than Lockheed and Boeing. I have first hand experience with this. I also believe that they pay better salaries."
Northrop Grumman,1dfeha81q1d01000,1.0,"Worst place every to work, do not recommend working at Northrop Grumman. Not a fan of the culture, the promotion process and rather not be a part of the company"

Northrop Grumman,1dfbf4og75j5v800,5.0,"I love this place, but it's time for me to venture out onto bigger and better jobs. I recommend this place for young teens who are just starting out or for people who need something stable. It gets busy sometimes, but that's about it."
Northrop Grumman,1dfa5f32ib84q800,4.0,"Good place to work, max pay is 22$ without a degree, benifits do not cover much, but they have 5000 a year in tuition reimbursement, and 2 weeks paid paternity leave"
Northrop Grumman,1df9vdeuch3i2800,5.0,"Northrop Grumman is a great place to work however as a contractor their job opportunities are based on contract awards. You have to move to different states to be able to advance. I am not in a position to move around. I prefer a more stable environment. They have excellent benefits and good management. My typical day at work is exciting and challenging and I do something different every day (above my normal duties). My colleges and managers are great to work with, professional and everyone gets along great. The company is very concerned about work life balance and very supportive. I also feel that Northrop Grumman is a very ethical company that cares about their workforce. The hardest part of the job is not knowing whether contracts will be renewed and if you will have a job. The most enjoyable part of my job is the folks I work with and being able to take on my responsibilities. I am most definitely a ""people"" person and ensure that my team is happy and productive. I'm know as the ""problem fixer"" and employees come to me for advice and to keep morale up. We are getting a new manger next week and the first thing he did was come to me and ask me to convey to the team that he has an open door policy. He gave me a great compliment and stated that he knows people trust me and that I am a people person and I have the general feel of morale for the team. He asked me what the biggest problems were on the team and asked for suggestions to encourage morale and enable our team to get the job done. I enjoy working for this company but our current contract ends soon and I do not wish to"
Northrop Grumman,1df906kbnb832800,4.0,"NG is a great company, decent pay, challenging work and great people. You ultimately decide when you go in and head home so great flexibility. I would recommend working here"

Northrop Grumman,1df6pg0j5h3hs800,4.0,"The environment is somewhat relaxed. They care about their employees and they have lots of fun company functions. The pay is ok, but they have almost unlimited volunteer overtime for those who really want to earn."
Northrop Grumman,1df4n1ab4b83d800,1.0,"The 80s and 90s were the cutting edge times in software for TRW/Northrop Grumman in Redondo Beach.  It was a great cultural place to balance work and raise a family.  For example, airline tix were always fully changeable (no questions asked) so minimal time was spent on the road.  Then the culture changed in the early 2000s about the time of NG's TRW acquisition.  Starting software engineers would not want to dedicate say 5-10 or more years of career as the commercial software tech industry started to compete and NG management didn't keep up with the salary and bonuses offered by the commercial industry. Example: NG's ""time in place"" type of policies (e.g. no promotion until X years in place regardless of superior performance, innovation or contribution).  This left a huge gap between the number of older engineers (45+) and the mid-level-to-younger engineers.  The Government with all of its regulatory requirements was often snail-paced slow to adopt new software technologies (e.g. agile) -- often due to contract structure or international sourcing. This caused 45-55 workers to be overbalanced as a population and salary capped with little to no ability to be promoted (unless someone retired and you were lucky enough to slot in). Starting software engineers salaries today are remarkably lower than starting commercial salaries. I left after 30 years but before retirement age.  I had enough. Thankfully I am the recipient of a pension -- something else that no longer exists."
Northrop Grumman,1df4io6275j5m800,4.0,"Very high pace job. It was an ok Job. My job involved constant travel, which got old real fast. It pays very well. And the health benefits were very good."
Northrop Grumman,1df3qi12852v6800,4.0,I enjoyed working there.  It was fun most of the time and most of the people got along with each other.  They would do games and giveaways which made for a nice environment.
Northrop Grumman,1df2h76cnh3tl800,2.0,I believe the production floor should have a union in place to help support the factory workers. The work environment did not have a well scheduled pace and as a result caused poorly distributed hours. The management had huge demands and did not manage production time well. In addition there is poor training techniques to help ensure quality products. The management does not treat everyone fairly. The work life balance is poor respected. The immediate supervisors force last minute long hours and mandatory overtime regularly.
Northrop Grumman,1devdnhulb85h800,1.0,"I was a ""valued employee"" for about 4 years, the division I was employed with was spun off and then Obama instituted the Budget Sequestration.  Northrop does not care about you as an individual at all... avoid working for them.  About the only good thing is I get some dollars as a pension in six months."
Northrop Grumman,1deun1qq052v6800,3.0,The company is satisfactory to me altho i was offered the job and got an offer letter it took to long to bring me on board. The benefits were not all that great. Most off all the people were good.
Northrop Grumman,1detlaluib85h800,3.0,It's a job and that's about it - it pays the bills but the work is less than desirable - pay is mediocre at best and new hires are able to move up the ladder fast.
Northrop Grumman,1det0gu90b83d800,4.0,Northrop is a good place to work but unless you're self motivated and ask questions the initial training is not that great.

Northrop Grumman,1deq0i9itb892804,3.0,"Good place to work, decent benefits and 401 plan. Good culture at remote sites. Volunteerism is big with this company. Management can be a challenge,,"
Northrop Grumman,1depjrh8lh3hn800,2.0,They have provided me with a good job but not the career I am seeking. One of the biggest problems they have is management. There are way to many  supervisors and middle management that things get disconnected. There are also way to many inconsistencies from one supervisor to the next. One month you will be getting a raise for your supervisors and the next month they will have moved him to a different area and your new supervisor has you on probation. The office politics are also very bad here.

Northrop Grumman,1deje0qb2h414800,3.0,"The majority of my years here have been really good. The last couple have been awful, with some improvement in the last few months. Management promotes very few from within and despite multiple people quitting during the last year out of frustration, they have recently posted a req for Sr Principle Systems Engineer - Integration and Test. There are only a few remaining people on the team with experience. They will leave if this position is not filled from within. I'm not training any more people hired in to positions that current employees are well qualified for."
Northrop Grumman,1dei5uig91d0o000,3.0,"Some groups and managers are very good at growing employees and providing good work/life balance.  Some managers really don't care.

Northrop Grumman,1ddqrnqmth3kl800,3.0,"The most important thing to know is the repetitive motion injuries you can receive there.  The management team micro manages every second while your at work.  This can be very stressful because it feels like they don't trust you to do the job.  You have a mix of friendly people there, with some not so friendly people.  The pay is good, but the health risk and the micro managing of its employees is not worth it."
Northrop Grumman,1ddqnj3300mcq000,5.0,"They had a great program for keeping employees engaged and happy. Pay wasn't fantastic, but the activities and sense of comradery made up for it. Hardest part is moving up with no degree."

There are many brilliant people that work there and many of the ones with long term experience will tell you it was better before Northrop Grumman acquired their former company (Orbital ATK, TRW, etc). The benefits and work life are watered down to be inlined with the rest of the defense industry meanwhile comparing them to, say, the software industry leaves a lot to be desired."
Northrop Grumman,1ddb5dfugh3rb800,3.0,"Overall NG isn't a bad company to work for. In my experience and six year tenure I've learned it just depends on the project sector and leadership team your under. Unfortunately, there has been a lot of reorganization within the company.

Northrop Grumman,1dda1opdeb854800,3.0,"Northrop Grumman is a comfortable place to work, and I mean that in both good and bad ways. It pays decently well, the jobs are moderately interesting, and the benefits and perks are okay. Unfortunately, the company's culture among its employees revolves around comfort rather than purpose. Even though the projects are cutting edge, the management does not instill purpose or vision; rather, they encourage contentment over drive. In my own experience, it seems that they do not reward those who do their jobs exceptionally and encourage employees to stay within the boundaries of their bureaucracy."
Northrop Grumman,1dda1nerqh438800,4.0,Greatly recommend if you are going into the defense industry. The Professional Development Program is a great experience around the company and promotes a healthy work culture. Excellent benefits for further education.

You don't get any thank you for all the hard work you do and get written up for it.

The pay is good, but raises are non-existent. Too many co-workers are topped out on the pay, so those of us who haven't been with the company for 20+ years have little chance of a raise or promotion due to the rules of the company. My husband is basically single since I'm at work so much. Unless you're an Engineer or Management, you don't matter and neither do your needs. I used to recommend this place as a good job. Now, unless every other business on Earth has disappeared, do yourself the favor of working somewhere else."

Northrop Grumman,1dcied7slb87o800,5.0,I had a wonderful experience as a Contract Recruiter at Northrop Grumman.  It's a great company to work for and I worked with a great team.
Northrop Grumman,1dchmqbvhh3hr800,4.0,"Nice people all around, ensuring that you are happy with your work and workplace.  Great communication with management team to let them know items of concern."
Northrop Grumman,1dcgks8tnh3q1800,2.0,Management and HR is HORRIBLE!!!!! Management lies and HR is extremely hard to reach. Company does not have employees back or care of thier concerns. I work 2nd shift I am extremely unhappy and it has put stress on my home life. I have went to HR and management and they did nothing to try to work with me.
Northrop Grumman,1dcgchs55h3pr801,5.0,"Great place to work,  They had lots of work and different projects which tested your skill set.  The team was helpful and setup internal education session bi weekly."
Northrop Grumman,1dcgc1a5ch3hm800,5.0,"A typical day may start at 5:00am or 9:30am due to the flexible hours, which is great for someone who isn't a morning person. You can also choose for the most part to work 40 hours or rack up overtime if you choose. The 9/80 scheduled with every other Friday off is great, too. At the same time, coming in later or choosing to take advantage of the 3 day weekends isn't always viewed favorably despite no one saying anything to you. After taking this job and relocating to another state I was informed that I will have to frequently work at other facilities outside of the state, which did not translate well with my family. Management has changed frequently without warning along with expectations and workloads. Coming from a military background where a TDY mentality is strong, I have found many people here share the same mentality, that this work is temporary and that money rather than the work being done is the most important thing. It makes it difficult to build a long term career when everyone thinks and acts that way. The pay is great, the employer title is great and the work being done is great. Unfortunately, I have quickly found that the hardest part of this job is surviving the office politics, cutthroat contractors, and ever-changing travel expectations that were hidden during the on boarding process."
Northrop Grumman,1dcfquup4h45j800,5.0,I was only there long enough to renew my clearance and NG supported the me fully aware I was leaving after the clearance was granted.  This was discussed prior to my hire date.

Northrop Grumman,1dceqi8lfh3ln800,5.0,Northrop Grumman was a nice place to work.  I couldn't have asked for a better supervisor.  I always felt that my supervisor was constantly looking out for me and my career goals.  I would still be there if I did not have to move out of state.

Northrop Grumman,1dc7t440nb858800,1.0,"Changes in management have resulted in an environment where everyone is watching their back and getting thrown under the bus is an everyday occurrence. In many instances, workloads have doubled or more. Cost and schedule are suffering,"
Northrop Grumman,1dc2l6fl724ge000,2.0,"There is a lot of nepotism and if you are not related to someone, you don't have much chance of getting ahead.  There are few opportunities and for the ones that do come along, there is pressure to give ""exposure"" to those who they are trying to promote."
Northrop Grumman,1dc08kl6nb855800,5.0,The staff was comprised of many talented people.  I learned something new nearly every day.  I was busy and often had competing priorities.

Northrop Grumman,1dc02i35024fe001,4.0,"I worked overseas and I'll never forget the excitement I had day to day learning new things and meeting new people. if given the opportunity, i would work for them again."
Northrop Grumman,1dbvlb4lph44g800,4.0,"For the area i was in Management was all over the place but it was only in my department. HR didn't seem to know what was going on or they didn't care.  It is better to establish what you want out of the position before getting hired, that way there are no surprises.

Northrop Grumman,1dbquqjb7b88l802,4.0,"All the good things you hear about this company is true. Benefits are excellent. I just want to mention all the bad things. First is that it's true the company is a defense contractor, therefore it is necessary to jump companies to advance your career. Second, the company is susceptible to over-engineer products in order to try and ""find more work"" or ""look good"" to the customer. This produces more waste and costly product, but good for NG. More money for us. These are the things that bother me most. Otherwise, a great place to work."
Northrop Grumman,1dbqnf4gob88l800,2.0,"The training absolutely SUCKS. They need to have their trainers attend classes on ""How to train"".

They encouraged me to take my short term and long term disability as needed to fight the cancer. I did and as of right now I am cancer free. They were more than willing to re-establish myself on the contract; however, I decided to retire since I am still fighting the side effects for the chemo drugs. The management was very supportive and encouraged me to come work for the company again when/if I decided to rejoin the workforce."

Northrop Grumman,1dbeulrer24gi002,3.0,"There are worse companies to work for. They do not fairly compensate employees based on experience, all they care about is a degree and how many certs you have so they can charge the government more for having you on their projects. You are a number at NG."

Northrop Grumman,1dbdjseor1d03000,2.0,They expected employees to work with limited tranning and had high expectations of employees. the tanning was horrible and they hired you in only as ammunition packer and told you the even you were qualified for a technician or maintenance position that you had to come in at the packer level. You were treated like you were in high school and not allowed to make suggestions ok given the opportunity to prove yourself. The packing department had a inexperienced supervisor who have favorites who would tattle on other employees and also were related to them.
Northrop Grumman,1dbdd83ke5na3800,4.0,"Good company for benefits, treat people fairly, no promotion.  Good places to work and will recommend to others.

Northrop Grumman,1db9lpffs1d03000,1.0,"Management intentionally understaffs projects and demands the remaining engineers meet their unrealistic commitments. The 9/80 benefit is mostly a lie, forced to work 5 and 6 day weeks, 50+ hours a week.  Burnout is VERY common, no one dares use the EAP program for fear of being reported and losing their security clearance (mandatory reporting of ALL counseling to security and Givernment)"

Northrop Grumman,1db6qh9if1fdk000,4.0,morning roll call and then go to my work station. I learned nothing. They were not big on career development. The management was not concerned with the work schedule. They were more concerned on body count. The hardest part of the job was being told to slow down because I was working to fast. Their was nothing enjoyable about the job. this is why I left

Northrop Grumman,1daq9dh945j54800,4.0,"Supply Chain folks are assigned to manage materials in a decentralized manner.  It's a large company with lots of opportunity to move around depending on your ambition.  It can be bureaucratic, and also like a family-style environment where you work with a cross-section of multi-disciplined people everyday.  The company follows a 9/80 work schedule, where you work 80 hours in 9 days and have every other Friday off, very popular.  Good pay, and benefits."
Northrop Grumman,1dapj52nmh41o800,2.0,"I was in the process of being laid off because the government contract was expiring. I had 3 follow on interviews with a different division within the company.

Managing employees thru Metrics which does not account for everything required to get the job done.  Some employees are targeted by HR to get rid of them because of higher salaries they earned.  Everything is about cost at the disposal of employees"

Northrop Grumman,1dafo9pq7h3ld800,4.0,"First you are not compensated at prevailing wage, you barely make half of what prevailing wage is. Cost of living raise each year is only 3% and that's it. no performance reward. Safety first and quality first is BS it's about production which is constantly slowed by lack of parts and postal sandbagging of items to be repaired and postal constantly threatens to pull the contract great place but be ready for full time BS. Techs are nit picked and held to higher standard than engineers and management. Most immediate supervisors are good with the exceptional jerks. Too many bums get away with slacking while hard workers expected too pick up slack. NG bs about ethics, something they fail to practice themselves. Won't stand up for employees and kiss postal tail on a daily basis. Engineers are incompetent and have no respect for techs who make things work. We generate the revenue but are rewarded the least."

Northrop Grumman,1d9tb3plmh3h8800,3.0,Management was  straight to the point and fast paced. I loved that I remained busy all day while working.  Sometimes they're expectations were not realistic I am not a mind reader and the staff didn't always just say what they needed or wanted you to do. The guys could use better communication skills instead of assuming you understand.
Northrop Grumman,1d9sspfs7h453800,4.0,"Typically you are expected to do whatever operations demanded.  I worked in quality as an Ultrasonic inspector and as quality should be set for making sure the parts are in good condition, operations sure expected us to blow through parts as fast as they wanted.

Northrop Grumman,1d9seh7klb85g800,4.0,"Management struggles to keep to their word when it comes to promoting from within and work/life balance.

Northrop Grumman,1d4l406vvb80u800,4.0,"The RM campus is very toxic. I love the work and my peers, but the MA leadership is terrible. Instead of all of the BU's working together, we've been separated and everyone is in silos. I was happy to finally work with very smart people and very smart engineers but the functional managers don't have a clue about what their team does; and can't help at all. You are reprimanded if you speak up and so many people just lay down and take the abuse. Other teams in SEIT are also forced to work 12 hour days even though they have families. When I originally interviewed I had a great manager and she defended me from all the dirt coming from up above; then there was a massive re-org and they moved me to another manager who only cares about herself. She takes people's work - erases their name and puts hers on there; claiming all the credit for the hard work done on METRICS presentations. I don't agree with this style of management and so I have to be careful with what I share or don't share. If I don't share; then that means I'm NOT ""collaborating with the team"". That's because after I put a ton of hours on BOEs or other work this woman erases my name and puts hers in there. Truly disgusting workplace. Don't come here if you don't like to play favorites and politics. I've never been in a more back stabbing environment; even LM was a lot better than this, too bad there's not a campus in IL."

Northrop Grumman,1d46987gobrcq800,3.0,"If you are provided with the right tools, you can do you job well.  Management always rewarded successful staff.  If you have the right education for your experience, you can be promoted within."
Northrop Grumman,1d43i83kdak4v800,5.0,"During an exercise with the military, I was an instructor presenting instructions on operations of the computer simulation in the WARSIM system.  During the instructions, I would assist US military soldiers with the operations of their system and answer and mentor them questions for them to succeed.  We worked 12 hours on a shift and were off 12 hours.   We did exercise planning when we were not working at an exercise.  We would work 8 hours a day and attend various meetings, coordinate different events for the exercises, prepare our instructions to be given at the exercises.  It was basically a project manager ensuring all tasks were prepared properly for success."
Northrop Grumman,1d412rb27b84l800,4.0,"I went to work and sat around until we were given a notification to proceed to our next training site, depending on who you were meant where you went.  Management was just trying to fly under the radar, the quarterly performance reviews were clearly all an after thought of how well you performed out training the students, and didn't have bad critiques from them.  Numerous trainers performed below standards but the company continued to send them as they need bodies to get through the fielding based on time not quality."
Northrop Grumman,1d411r4jkaqgj800,5.0,"Great place to work, I just wish I lived closer and didn't have such a long commute, especially in bad weather. Great place to work, I will not leave unless something WAY BETTER comes along."
Northrop Grumman,1d3uot7q3ak4l801,4.0,Great Experience
Northrop Grumman,1d3ug8173ak4l802,5.0,"An amazing place to begin your engineering career in high school. Learned a lot during the school year, and was given real work experience over the summers. I do wish we worked more hours in the summer because more money would have been better. Plus it would have given us more time to complete our project. But overall, it was a great experience!"
Northrop Grumman,1d3tukkslas0l800,4.0,I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. A knowledge rich atmosphere with much to learn. State of the art electronics and above average compensation. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
Northrop Grumman,1ebfcse9urcsp800,5.0,"An amazing company, understands the military and provides a great culture. I would love to work the rest of my life at the company. They will help you with obtaining your goals and leave you in a good place for retirement."
Northrop Grumman,1d3tugtlkakck800,5.0,Northrop Grumman was a cool place to work. I ended up leaving because I didn't have enough work assignments to keep me busy on a given day. It was a great place to work.
Northrop Grumman,1d3s55l5sas0l800,4.0,"Nothing good to say, nothing bad to say.  It was a job that paid fairly well for a summer internship and the work was neither notably interesting nor notably uninteresting."
Northrop Grumman,1d3re1abtb88j800,1.0,Did not emphasize retaining contract employees. Did not train for ground run.Armed Guards did not understand English. Was sick twice in the hospital while on tour. For three years the company is still reporting on my taxes that I lived in MD. I have never lived in MD.
Northrop Grumman,1d3r18snl5n8j800,4.0,It was a good place to work and would consider working for company again. It was long hours and mission was important. Middle management could have used some fine tuning but over all good.
Northrop Grumman,1d3pn5q8f52sj800,5.0,I worked here so long.  I loved being there and was so sad when i was laid off.  I would go back in a sec if able to.  Work life was decent and co-workers helped and where a pleasure to work with.
Northrop Grumman,1d3mc5bcd5n8j800,5.0,"I loved my time at Northrop Grumman.  My coworkers were very intelligent and caring people.  There was a lot of restructuring, but I liked every manager that I had.  The most difficult part of the job to deal with was all of the red tape in security.  The best part of the job was the physical building, coworkers and all of the interesting projects that the company is involved in."
Northrop Grumman,1d3l21fpoakgi800,4.0,"Most of the staff were friendly and competent. The work environment was pleasant, too. The only problem I faced was the management, located in Boulder, CO. It was distant and ineffective."
Northrop Grumman,1d3k70vl61d0v000,5.0,Very fast paced environment.  Never a dull moment.  Co workers are very helpful. Cross training is a daily activity. A workplace that has a lot of opportunities to expand to other divisions.
Northrop Grumman,1d3k0j8f41d0f000,1.0,"Should have gone with gut feeling and left sooner. Complete Program Management swap out with new hires, that clearly were not qualified. Known problems need to be rectified. When addressing, with a fix, get in trouble for pointing out the obvious and ostracized. Was hired to make constructive changes  Every step of the way was hit head on with “That’s how it’s always been done” or “That’s what the customer expects” or lame excuses of requirements are meant by untrue means that have some how been accepted by management, auditors and/or the customer. Favoritism is rampant. Family members get an easy in, regardless of ability to do work. Those who are not capable just get passed around from job to job. There’s a reason why proposals that were expected to be awarded are not. It’s finally catching up to the truth of things and it’s not pretty. Guess I have finally realized why the company buys out other companies, it’s because they don’t have the talent/know how. What an epiphany. Run, run away as fast as you can. Avoid the quicksand."
Northrop Grumman,1d3jgsrv4aqgh800,1.0,"In order to enough people to fulfil the contract, NG had people apply to false requisition then had them do nothing and apply to get jobs internally. Hiring managers sometimes knew and at other times did not know and would hire external candidates instead."
Northrop Grumman,1d3jd30b51d0v000,4.0,"At NGC I am tasked with many different hats to fulfill. It is hard to explain a typical work day because each day is not typical. The hardest part of the job is having to complete all the Corporate flow downs that are very time consuming and never really amount to anything other than meetings, engagements, and reviews."
Northrop Grumman,1d3ij6pr01fdu000,5.0,Fantastic place to work. Great place to start a career. I can not say enough good things about working here. You will be enriched both as a person and a professional.
Northrop Grumman,1d3hfjtj3ak4h800,3.0,"I've really loved working at this company, the group of individuals I work with are unmatched. My only real complaints are about the company culture. Northrop is run by people who focus on the past and how things used to be done. In terms of benefits, and what they have the potential to offer their employees, they are severely lacking. They have the potential and overhead to offer longer maternity leave, better tuition reimbursement, cheaper, and more widely offered medical benefits, and they choose not to. Working in recruiting and seeing what these other companies are offering to their candidates, Northrop is coming up short in a big way. They put a lot of pride into their annual survey results, but absolutely lack on follow through when it comes down to what their employees are actually asking for."
Northrop Grumman,1d3h6eris1baf000,5.0,"Overall, a great place to work.  Good salary, great benefits, especially tuition coverage.  Was laid off, but wish I could get back there.  Excellent direct manager."
Northrop Grumman,1d3fg3h3q1d1b000,5.0,"Can be a really hit/miss company depending on location and team you get assigned to. I really enjoyed 1 year, changed teams and then was very unhappy with another team."
Northrop Grumman,1d3f0m3cq1fdu000,5.0,I have nothing but good things to say about my experience at Northrop Grumman. I learned great working skills and was mentored to become a great employee to my future employers.
Northrop Grumman,1d3eli39a0mct001,4.0,"It was a place to work with great co-workers, but the managers lied a lot to the workers. You would do great work in one area and they would move you from there to a new work assignment and move a senior worker into your place that you were doing great in."
Northrop Grumman,1d3e9iml40mte000,5.0,"I would recommend Northrop Grumman to any one. Large company with great benefits. Managers have a clear understanding of personal advancement opportunities, and willing to work with you in obtaining your desired career choice."

Northrop Grumman,1d34khmu41baf001,4.0,At my most recent position I was never given the opportunity to learn all of the aspects of the PCA role.  Only alternative was to move to another PCA position.
Northrop Grumman,1d34jbo161baf000,5.0,I started out at my job not knowing much about the department I was in. I loaded parts and tooling. By the time I left the company I had received training and tested out as a Level 1 NDI Inspector. The hardest part of the job was the long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the events they held for employee appreciation.
Northrop Grumman,1d34hbppr1fdu000,4.0,Northrop Grumman offers a very good environment to work. Provide good salary. Enjoyed working in this company. NG Offers good work life balance. Provides opportunity to learn new things.

Northrop Grumman,1d32qf0eb1fdm001,5.0,I feel northrop grumman does a pretty good job accommodating it's employees.  I have worked with them for over 10 years.  Always not easy but they definitely try to make sure their employees are well taken care of.
Northrop Grumman,1d31f7dd01ba7000,2.0,"Corporate and Enterprise Services create too much additional and excessive processes. The people in the corporate and enterprise services know they aren't going anywhere because the holding company mentality. They will sell off divisions that don't perform, but the inefficient performance of corporate and enterprise services is clearly not measured. Too much overhead."
Northrop Grumman,1d30ft4b01ahn000,3.0,I worked in a private company that was bought by Northrop Grumman. They still have Amherst Systems on their website.
Northrop Grumman,1d2vfgsf01ah8000,5.0,Overall great place to work great work environment but like all the jobs in the aviation avionics industry see the Feast of famine due to the government contracts.
Northrop Grumman,1d2v5l3cb1agn000,5.0,I was hired on for a temporary contract.  I knew it was only going to be 18 months or so.  It was a good place to work.  I could have stayed with them if I would have been willing to move to Maryland but I still had kids in school here at that time and wasn't going to move. So I got the job with DoD.
Northrop Grumman,1d2u2hma11ba7000,4.0,Working for Northrop Grumman was very rewarding.  I was able to learn multiple new disciplines and was able to grow my technical prowess under the guidance of multiple mentors.
Northrop Grumman,1d2smblm61d0n000,4.0,Management and employees where great to work with. I had a great group of employees reporting to me. Sometimes management would provide lunch. Very strong on safety.
Northrop Grumman,1d2s3folp1ai8000,4.0,Good place to work. Everybody there was very professional and the process was smooth. Its an institution with a proven track record of A grade accomplishments.
Northrop Grumman,1d2q0u0fj1d06000,4.0,"Overall, NG is a great place to work at. Like most defense engineering companies, the work ebbs and flows. Raises are yearly, but promotions are slow."
Northrop Grumman,1d2oq8d911ah7000,3.0,great place to work good people great opp but have to explore other opporitunities and see what is out there to start a new career thanks for everything
Northrop Grumman,1d2nm7or61d06000,4.0,Plenty of opportunities if you are an engineer.  Employ veterans and a multicultural working environment.  Employee surveys were offered yearly and management was interested in employee engagement.
Northrop Grumman,1d2naaais0mto000,3.0,"10 years working for Northrop Grumman as a field support rep maintaining equipment at postal sites. Duties included weekly, monthly, quarterly maintenance of Biohazard Detection Systems (BDS). Job required driving company van to all assigned sites on a daily basis (400,000 + miles and 3 vans over the 10 year period)."
Northrop Grumman,1d2l4hfka0mt6000,5.0,pay was on an hourly rate but paid out on a fixed salary per biweekly period stated specifically in a signed contract. My time at Northrop Grumman has been a successful experience.
Northrop Grumman,1d2gm77gd1d14000,4.0,"Days at work are not very eventful. Most systems are automated, and just require the minimal amount of monitoring. Occasional ground or satellite glitches occur, but are usually an easy fix."

Northrop Grumman,1d2fqkj0o0kbm000,3.0,Northrop has it together as far as the company as a whole goes.  It can be a little daunting at first because the onboard process is something you get thrown into on your own because nobody remembers where they went to do it as it is all online.  The program is where you see things start to falter and I never really felt like there was opportunity above.  Over time the benefits have kept getting worse which seems odd for a company of this size.  I strongly feel that the executives take too much of the funding and should pay better as the first time I worked there i was laid off.  Meanwhile the head of that sector received a 17 million dollar bonus.  Seriously?  Nothing you could do is so hard that you honestly deserve 17 mil bonus. especially when people are getting laid off.  Maybe one day corporate america will change or maybe one day we will stand up against the tyranny
Northrop Grumman,1d2eiosi6b860800,5.0,Great company to work for.  Opportunities at every turn to learn and grow as a professional.  Vast training resources to assist in mastering new skills.
Northrop Grumman,1d2ebvk78b860800,3.0,its a good company to work for if you are in a high paying job but if you are on the production operator aspect it gets stressful. The number one thing that I would have to complain about is the lack of training that new people receive
Northrop Grumman,1d2e82e1e5j5c800,3.0,"I have friends and colleagues who work in other sectors and divisions of the organization and love it. Unfortunately some Sector / Division / Office Locations are known to have retention issues. Middle-Management is out of touch with reality and is poor at setting their team up for success. All they seem to care about is the bottom line rather than rewarding top performers. You just get a pat on the back and a ""keep up the good work"", but rarely see promotion opportunities. Same thing with salary increase opportunities. Only increases are the typical standard cost of living increases which seldom account for anything when you are not compensated fairly to begin with. But again, there are plenty of other locations where it is almost as if you work for a completely different, better, company."
Northrop Grumman,1d2e3mf00akdg800,5.0,Local management in the San Angelo office was excellent. Good safe working environment. Flexible work days and employees felt respected. Would work for again.
Northrop Grumman,1d2e0sg4gas1m800,4.0,"I only left because another company hired me for HR, which is what I went to college for, to grow beyond just ""admin assistant"".

Northrop Grumman,1d2dcd0n15n9g800,4.0,"It was a great experience to work here. I learned a lot and worked a lot with javascript and python. The mentors were very willing to help me learn. I was on a team with no other interns so it was mainly older people, so it was boring at times in terms of the social aspect. But overall a great opportunity and something that people really respect when they see it on my resume."
Northrop Grumman,1d2d1g9t7b89r800,4.0,"Northrop Grumman is a collection of several other companies that has created one of the largest Defense and Space Corporations in the US.

Northrop Grumman,1d2b815qu5j5c800,4.0,My experience here has been great. I'm currently in a 3 year professional development rotation. This has given me the opportunity to learn as i go while still developing my skill sets for future endeavors.

Northrop Grumman,1d2b0s72rak9l800,3.0,"Overall a fair place to work.  Advancement is difficult, especially for senior level employees.  Benefits are pretty good, but medical is expensive.

Northrop Grumman,1d2amqk7fas1m800,3.0,I was a software manager that was stressful.  I quit the job after working at Northrop Grumman for 25 years on various projects.  Some of the projects required travel.

Northrop Grumman,1d26ecij7b81u800,3.0,Northrop Grumman is a great company for people who are looking to learn and make things happen. Majority of the population is close to retirement and always willing to share their experience. The 9/80 schedule is awesome for work life balance.

Northrop Grumman,1d21ionq1brdo800,4.0,"I was the most qualified boat technician, yet the manager chose to advance an employee that had been working for the company less than a year and had less qualifications.  Also discriminated against me for a injury that happened in the work place.  Manager told me the only way I would be advanced was if I max out the pay as a level 2 technician."
Northrop Grumman,1d1v2mjquak9b800,5.0,"I enjoy working for a company that supports America and its military that protects our country. All of the projects I have worked have supported beneficiaries receiving state assistance to help them be productive individuals, which is a great feeling."

Northrop Grumman,1d1u9kpfsakd7801,4.0,"Due to many acquisitions at the time of my employment, there were many different subcultures. Due to the enormous size and subcultures splits, it was difficult to find a comfort zone. Northrop pays well, I was very well compensated as a female professional. They had excellent professional development opportunities, the work was challenging, and management encouraged and supported career advancement. At the time, Northrop was challenged to redeploy people due to the organizational structure, which led to higher turnover than normal."
Northrop Grumman,1d1tmce3jakd7800,4.0,"Northrop Grumman is a top notch corporation that has opportunity to grow if you fit into the mold that is needed. Often for older employees (non-new grads) programs for accelerated growth are not as prevalent; it is up to older employees to figure out paths of career growth on their own. That said, it is a good company to work for and they do offer good benefits and opportunity if you fit the mold of the company and its strategic path. Culture is definitely broad and open and they support many different ways of daily work/life balance needs."
Northrop Grumman,1d1spf6i8b85o800,4.0,"Didn't play an important role on the projects i was involved in, even though it was an internship position kinda felt that they were just herding ppl in to replace all the retire age engineers.

Northrop Grumman,1d1jr5unpaqh1801,5.0,They treat you like a valued asset and do everything they can to help you achieve more and support your career.  Once my branch was closing they even offers training in some of my lesser skills to help me potentially stay with them in other capacities.

Unfortunately, the little corner of the company I worked in didn't really care about keeping their people when contracts were downsized. Too many other priorities were at play and I was pushed to the wayside. Unfortunate, the benefits at the time I worked there were outstanding."
Northrop Grumman,1d1c77oe25n94800,2.0,GSC is the worst place to work for this company. Buyers are treated like bottom feeders. Come in upper level or go to another business area. I came in in 2016 at entry level and have been dealing with pure in professionalism since.

Northrop Grumman,1d1bscpdcakh1800,3.0,"High turnover rate, understaffed, poor higher management during my time there. The other officers were good, and some would bend over backwards for the company however the company did not reward those people. Working security if your relief did not show up for work that day, that meant you did not get to go home, so if it calls for snow you could be trapped at work for days on end. The job was not hard, but for the years that I was there, a 40 hour work week was not the norm, 60 hour+ weeks were the norm due to the insane amount of understaffing for positions."

Northrop Grumman,1d0km79jvb80h800,4.0,"Since it is an older company, things move slow. However, this allows for a normal work schedule that provides work/life balance. As the older workforce prepares for retirement, there is lots of opportunities for Millennials to advance their career. The culture may be challenging for most Millennials, as the company's leadership style is still command-and-control, promote by seniority, and very hierarchical. You do need to manage your own career and drive your manager to help find future opportunities across the company. The benefits are good, but they recently got rid of their pension plan a few years ago.

Northrop Grumman,1cvipb7c31ahv000,4.0,"It is like the other companies.  They all have their things they do to say they are looking after their employees, but none of them make it easy to get money for training or conferences even though they say they budget for it and want employees to go to it.  They also resist providing time to go to these things.  They want employees to get the most chargeable hours and that does not work with training and conferences that are during work hours."

Northrop Grumman,1cv43uk421ahd000,3.0,"I worked at Northrop Grumman for over 30 years as an engineer and manager. Up until about 10 years ago it was a great place to work. They valued employees as people and would go to great lengths to see that the human capital was preserved. That is not the environment now. At least in the IT world. People have little value and are used then thrown out. They are actively recruiting youth. Which is not bad, but it is at the expense of seasoned veterans. Experience is not as highly valued. It's all about the mighty dollar now."
Northrop Grumman,1cv2ukte31bac000,2.0,"When I initially found out I was going to be working at NG I was ecstatic. I shortly there after realized that it was not what I had been expecting. From the day I was put on the floor I felt targeted. I was harassed by HR for everything from my Facebook down to pants I was wearing at the credit union  on my day off. I was eventually laid off for putting sunglasses on in the hanger before stepping out side on my break. I wrote a letter to the head of HR a detailed timeline of events explaining how it seemed to myself and many others that I had been bullied and wanted an explination. I was told “we have done worse for less”. Even my father, the Director of Maintenance and Operations was unsuccessful at receiving a reason. I am very disappointed in how things are actually run at Northrop Grumman."

Northrop Grumman,1cv1q0p981ai6000,1.0,"Maybe it was because I was a contractor and their #3 choice, or because my supervisor never believed I was a good fit.  Either way, it was an unpleasant place to work.  I recommend only accepting perm positions with this company.  Perm employees are less easy to discard.  They have a longer runway to be productive, and there is more ""buy in"" to their success."
Northrop Grumman,1cv1g53j91d0l000,4.0,"good experience, nice people, great benefits, good retirement  why do I have to fill this out don't have anything else to say. Would still be working there but was layed off"

Northrop Grumman,1cucpoq8m1d10000,3.0,"I spent almost 10 years with NG in 4 different locations and as hard as I worked nothing changed. I volunteered countless hours supporting their employee resource groups and made significant changes but the culture is tainted and middle management is horrible. They cater to the 20 somethings and ignore their seasoned employees that still want to learn and grow and unless you're really good at playing ""the game"", you won't likely get very far."

Northrop Grumman,1ctqiu4lv1agi000,1.0,"I tell you no matter hard you work (I can tell for IT/IS sector) no matter how you're, it doesn't work here.  For them you're just a number who's bringing money for them.  They don't even bother asking if you're interested in climbing up a leader. Again, here it's not what you know it's who you know."

Northrop Grumman,1ctlgj5kp5nbv800,3.0,"A typical day at my workplace is that it is nine hours a day, six days a week, with micromanagement, pay is not that great from being alone from your family. Everyone must wear uniforms, promotions are not good, all at a need to know and favoritism with the different people in the workplace and very secretive. Communication and information not good, and leadership is not professional. You also must be self-motivated."
Northrop Grumman,1ctk507mrakiv800,4.0,"While working on a large satellite program at Northrop, I found myself hating the job because it was boring, uneventful, and purely fueled off processes rather than novel design.

Northrop Grumman,1cstrrrigaker800,4.0,"Northrop hires high-achievers.  It is not easy to get into the company. As a result, a typical day is dynamic, active and you have to be flexible and be able to Pivot. I grew exponentially at Northrop, their support for growth in technical areas is phenomenal.  Any area of technology you might want to explore is available to you. The workplace culture is divine, it provides volunteer opportunities in many areas, employee resource groups that do many things such as hiking, boating, art, etc.  The diversity is a picture of the globe and women are supported in their career growth.  The hardest part of the job is the disconnect between executive management goals and the goals of the middle managers.  While the Executive managers see employees as their number one asset, the middle managers have not quite caught on and sometimes do not manage work in a manner that employees have a healthy work balance. Some of them are also not customer focused making the job of those who are a little difficult. The most enjoyable has been the ability to be introduced to new technologies and having a seat up front in the emerging technologies such as AI and machine learning.  And the outlet to give back in the volunteer opportunities is over the top enjoyable."

Northrop Grumman,1cqnb15e2aki0800,3.0,"Northrop Grumman was good to me as an employee overall.  I had 6 years of stable employment with them overall (two seperate long-term federal contracts as a GIS Analyst.  The program management was more of a hands-off style, which, at higher levels in many lines of work, a lot of people like.  On the down side, I honestly felt like just a number sometimes and like program management wasn't interfacing with their team enough on a more personal level beyond just day-to-day business.  This was also evident in the fact that program management was not always as in-touch with changes (or lack of progression) actual nature of roles for of their contractors, which may have simply been a function of the client simply not telling them everything when updating a program manager (as is their perogative as the client to some degree), program managers having too much to manage and just can't keep more periodically with everyone, or whatever the reason was.  Simply put, I wish it would have been possible to know my program manager on a more personal level and have more opportunities to interface with them on how things were actually going as a mere employee.  It seemed as though team leads below them had the lion's share of opportunities for this degree of essential interfacing."

Northrop Grumman,1cmh082rmb85bbf6,4.0,"Good benefits and great job security.  The company does a good job of supporting work-life balance by way of allowing flexible options for managing family events and emergencies.  It can be challenging to move around the company for career growth though, unless you have the good fortune of being selected for a rotation program.  While the executive leadership have great intentions and genuine concern for their employees, lower level management is hit or miss.  Company culture and leadership is inconsistent across departments.  There's a huge gap between those who come into the company and quickly soar up the career ladder, and those who are starved for promotion after years of service.  The company could benefit from a stronger emphasis on cross-training and requiring employees to rotate through related departments or across programs.  If you want a secure, predictable job, it's a good place to be."

I started out with two good managers who were very helpful, and finished with one that the government customer told me should not be a manager. Guess which one is still there? Government contracting is not generally a good place to be. Unless you have friends high up, it is a short term assignment. Hours were good. Pay was ok, at the time. Lots of nice people.

They were very strict on time. If you came in even a minute late, they will know and you will get in trouble. There is a ""strike"" system, but it is very short and stern. The hours were a bit of a stretch, with a full work day being twelve hours starting very early and ending in the late afternoon. You walk in early in the morning, clock in, and start work. There are breaks, including over an hour for lunch, in which you are almost completely free to do as you please as long as you're back to work before break is over and do not break company policy.

The most enjoyable part of the job is the company' gatherings. You will meet a lot of interesting people and how well diverse the culture and they combine their ideals to one one another.

Northrop Grumman,1cft842ipb84hdfn,2.0,Unionized and compartmentalized.  Not a good place to learn or grow.  A very combative place where parties are very territorial (see unionized).  On most assignments I can grow and make inroads.  Here there were all sorts of barriers.  This seems to be a dinosaur company and a very inflexible one at that.  My manager was a good guy who was put in a bad spot and did his best to take care of us.
Northrop Grumman,1cfstsp2d1bgf479,5.0,"I started as a Laser Tech.  I loved working there.  When I asked to learn more than assembling lasers, they taught me how to troubleshoot them.  Then I was taught how to build all the sub assemblies that went into make the laser.  They took a Gallop Poll each year and each department worked on an area that was considered a low.

If you are a Senior person you may find yourself as the lead where you will train junior people. This company encourages you to take on new work and skills. This is good but there is no room for failure even if you are learning a new skill.  Sometimes you will see a Junior person in the place of senior technical level position. Support can be sporadic at times as it will be up to you to figure out the solution among yourself.  The compensation packages are pretty good.  They pay at market value.  If you are looking to have a long career in corporate America this is a good company to accomplish that in."

Northrop Grumman,1cf0ecgj1akd4cgn,3.0,"The rolling Meadows site for NGC is very old school.  Projects are still run as waterfall (although they are trying to change).  Change is needed, but extremely slow.  Seniority and Command and Control culture is very strong and causes a lot of roadblocks to innovation.  Manual testing is still king (and still extremely inefficient).  Tons of bureaucracy and waste in the antiquated tools and process.  The culture is rather non-existent.  Communication is constantly a problem."
Northrop Grumman,1cevion065j528f9,3.0,"I like working for Northrop Grumman. However, the culture here is not geared for advancement. All roles and extra responsibilities that I have been given here in the past 10 years have been unofficial, functional roles. This way, management can still pay you the low salary of your level 1 position while you are wearing 5 different hats for 3 different contracts. Out of the 100 some coworkers I have worked with, most of them got different positions in different departments or with different companies. Higher level positions inside my department were always hired externally instead of promoting from within. I really wanted to like working for the company but I am spinning tires under current management."

I have seen too many people get fired, or placed on performance plans solely due to personality conflicts with management or because they want change. I have not met one happy employee from any department within TS. If the sector invested in training and holding their management accountable and taking the employee surveys seriously or employee concerns then, perhaps  this sector could be as good as the others. If you are considering this company I suggest look into the other sectors such as  MS or AS, as these two sectors value people, great work life balance, and have excellent leadership. For all my military vets considering the company look for opportunities outside of TS."

Northrop was ill prepared to rehome over 60 employees within and left many quite disillusioned and in sudden despair. When it was good it was great. When it failed it failed across the board in terms of Management communications and honesty."
Northrop Grumman,1cd0a9qn81bgb6gu,3.0,"Large organization with a lot of red tape.  Steady work though and it can be rewarding.  Lots of good people, but also some bad.  Moving up can be difficult if you aren't well connected."

I felt that the diversity opportunities were extremely limited once the Director level was approached. I felt that after many years of service that I had proved myself over and over again, but I could never break thru to the next level. I think that if the culture does not change that Northrop will just become a training ground for other companies."
Northrop Grumman,1ccumnipf1d0i1tq,4.0,I spent my day writing scripts to test the software.  I attended meetings with the engineers to discuss testing.  I was left alone to get my work done which I appreciated.  The culture encourages growth and teamwork.  The most difficult part of the job was moving data in and out of the Top Secret environment.  I really enjoyed the people I worked with.  I left because it was too long of a drive to work (Aurora to Boulder)
Northrop Grumman,1ccuj6gr7ak8r8p5,5.0,My employment at Northrop Grumman is one I look back on with appreciation. Management was professional but personable. Co-workers were very supportive and courteous. Benefits exceeded my expectations. Great company to work for.

Northrop Grumman,1ccfg680m5n90e48,3.0,"From a software development and engineering perspective, they are locked in the 90s. I can only attribute it to the lack of cross pollination of ideas, techniques, and best practices from other companies and other business sectors."

Assigned to a lower tier Subcontract Administration assignment that was well below my level of expertise thus causing frustration and very little job satisfaction.  Generally the work environment was good and my co-workers became friends. During my five month tenure, I only met with my Manager four times for very brief periods.

Northrop Grumman,1cb8gpppe1d13563,4.0,"NG is a fun and interesting place to work. While not stressful, you are expected to know your job inside and out. Often, you're required to make decisions that your direct manager may not know about in detail. This means you have to be a duty expert on a daily basis. There is room for growth. Like most businesses that deal with the government, there is plenty of process and red tape to slow progress on nearly every task."

Northrop Grumman,1c9n3mlmt1agt51q,3.0,"When I was there, they did an extremely poor job of investing in their employees. There was no career path, and no easy way to match an employee up with potential work. Employees cut from contracts would be put on the ""Available Talent List"" and have just a few weeks to find themselves another project to bill against, or risk being RIFed. Yet there was no easy way for those employees to search across the company and find all available openings. Instead it was best to rely on an internal network, if you had one, which was very hit or miss. There is little reason for this, as they always need people, and are often recruiting outside the company, even while letting people go who couldn't find their next gig. This is a major failing of Northrop, and means it is a company that really makes it difficult to expect to have a long career."

I enjoy what I do but there are some managers that don't need to be managers.

I do not have the tools to do my job yet I’m constantly getting more and more work thrown at me. It’s a complete mess and we are putting out one fire after the next.

Northrop Grumman,1c8gnfd8jb8bvbdv,2.0,"The company is setup for a failure.  The culture is very toxic and non-supportive.  Management style is outdated and people in managerial role are in the position due to the connections not for their caliber. Managers have ZERO interpersonal skills.  Please do yourself a favor and find another employer to work for.  The company may offer higher pay than other employers, but please do not fall for it."
Northrop Grumman,1c8gk5cug1d0e4s2,5.0,I highly recommend Northrop Grumman. I was provided with multiple opportunities that otherwise would be unavailable anywhere else. I was able to support multiple missions with multiple tenant organizations while with Northrop Grumman.

Northrop Grumman,1c8g8vik41d0e6if,3.0,"Northrop has many projects and one's experience will depend largely on which group you are in. I've worked there in four different groups and some are better than others. One was good, two were poor, one was awful. In general, the experience was better than average,.as is the pay. Numerous  managers on some projects had a reputation for incompetence. On one project, contractors were led to believe the project would last a year, but all were laid off when the project was cancelled for lack of funds."

Northrop Grumman,1c8djlpg81d0969l,3.0,"Work was challenging which was great, people were hit and miss on how willing they were to work with anyone.

Northrop Grumman,1c7utuc07aqjfakr,3.0,"Work was taxing but enjoyable. As a air defense trainer, I was working with air defense personnel from an country in Africa. The language issues and length of course proved challenging in being able to hold the attention of the audience. Management was good for the most part.  Hardest part of the job was teaching for long errors with no break. The enjoyable part is when the training increases overall positive results."
Northrop Grumman,1c7ugvf6uaqjfanj,4.0,Treats you with respect and trusts that you have the knowledge you say you have and doesn't micro-manage you into the ground. The atmosphere is upbeat and encouraging so the days seemed to fly by with a sense of accomplishment.

Northrop Grumman,1c7ou6pkhak7ial3,5.0,"They have treated me very well over the years. Days are fairly relaxed but work is still completed. Very volatile working arrangement, as with anything related to government contracts its is feast or famine. Some months it will be very slow with not a lot going on and others will be long hour days with no breaks for months. High level management seems to be an old boys club where friends and family get hired in and promoted more frequently than someone with no ties higher up. As of recently, the management seems to care more about stock prices and profits rather than employees but they are working to change that. Lower level management is usually quite good however and genuinely seem to care about their folks. Hardest part of the job is the actual work, it is highly technical in nature with a steep learning curve. Training is very weak and nearly non-existent, putting the burden of learning the system on you personally. Once you learn the system however, the job is quite enjoyable since the stuff you actually work on is very cool. Overall, its a pretty good place to work."
Northrop Grumman,1c7oanl0g5j76dso,4.0,"That isn’t the end of the MHS’ ammunition woes. While the pistol apparently has no issue cycling the Army’s new XM1153 “special purpose” cartridge, a hollow point round, it apparently does not function reliably when loaded with the standard XM1152 “ball” rounds used most often in service. In order to qualify as a military service weapon, the pistol must be able to fire 2,000 rounds without stoppages at least 95% of the time – a standard both the M17 and M18 pistols were able to meet with hollow points, but with standard ammo, that reliability rate dropped to a dismal 75% in the full size platform, and an even worse 60% on the compact one."

Reasonable management structure that performed best they could under the demanding circumstances.  The workplace was filled with alpha, can do personalities.  The hardest part of the job was keeping current with the new upgraded systems.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the new systems."
Northrop Grumman,1c77f4apa5nbb84a,3.0,"As a large corporation created by multiple merges, NG has struggled to create a single culture.  Also, due to its nature as a government contractor, work security is not guaranteed.

Northrop Grumman,1c6vtm2slbrf7dis,3.0,"I work in assembly on the F-35 Lightening program at the Palmdale CA site. NG has a good reputation generally speaking, but my experience here thus far has been a real ""eye opener."" While attending school to get my foot in the door here, (I could not otherwise & I tried, even with a BA) I was promised the world. The Instructors touted it as the best thing since sliced bread, and they bad mouthed the competition (Lockheed as their primary example). Yet a little over one month in, my accomplished dream of working here has become almost a nightmare at this point. I left another smaller Co. as a Composite Technician/contractor in Mojave CA to come here - a place that I truly enjoyed working at, but this Co. hadn't offered me any permanency, so I was forced to go where I had more security and a future for my family. I can't speak for everyone or each position here at NG, (I'm sure it varies) but generally speaking, the training is almost nonexistent and the management is sub-par, mostly due to a lack of people skills, and huge influx of new employees. It's a ""sink or swim,"" very stressful environment. The numbers are everything, and don't make too many mistakes here, or you'll be ""walked out."" My hope is to weather the storm, put my time in and apply for a different position in a different dept. or leave this Co. all together. Like I said, I can only speak for the F-35 program. It may be ""Peachy keen"" in Engineering or Inspections. ;)"

Northrop Grumman,1c6v3e036akbict9,3.0,Overall NG is a fine place to work as aerospace companes go.  I am looking to leave only because I have come to learn that people in Colorado as a whole are overly concerned with what other people are doing.
Northrop Grumman,1c6tka3rgb8b78sj,5.0,Management felt like family so did your co workers. The work was fulfilling and felt like you accomplished something we you got your wire harnesses made on time.

Northrop Grumman,1c6tda8q7b87cak8,4.0,"look...Northrop is a great place to work and I've spent many of my years there, so i'm not going to give you a ""my typical day"" because this thing would be a novel. I can tell you that Northrop has a large collective of management that all strives for the company's goals and achievements in the aerospace industry to be number 1, so....that makes for very stressed out individuals....and a lot of them. i guess what i'm saying is management is good but not the greatest. workplace culture....quality, customer satisfaction, leadership, integrity, people, teamwork. Now that all those sound good, it really is like high school clicks or groups, but it seems to come together when it needs to so the job can get done. Hardest part of the job is the commitment to stress...more often than not, not really the best balance, when you try to find some it seems that your trying to get away. The most enjoyable part and the one thing that kept me going.....the great people that work there, it does seem to out number the others, i say out number...there are more technicians and support functions there with great people, which far out number the others."

If there was a position with this organization in my new location, I would be working for them today."
Northrop Grumman,1c6scg2ifak7acg4,5.0,"Off-site location work independently with little supervision.  NG provided guidelines for me to follow and conducted program reviews to ensure that the project and I were following best practices and guidelines established.    NG provided a really great work environment. NG took care of the employees, create a suggestion program and act on the employee suggestions NG left it up to the employees to develop his or her career and have use the most updated software and technically products available.  Not being on main campus, getting to know or meet the leadership faced to face was the most discouraging thing about my job."
Northrop Grumman,1c6rq2t00b83g9qb,4.0,Great group who care about their employees but need to stay competitive so they underpay staff.  Negotiate higher salary to start as merits and increases are small.

Northrop Grumman,1c6oe3ng6b879dkb,2.0,"Of course, there's always *something* good to say, but what's so great about a place populated with narcissists, cliques, shunning, backstabbing, rudeness, bullying, hate, inter-sector animosity, lower-than-average pay, almost non-existent raises, never getting credit for your work, no chance for advancement, only the *golden* get bonuses, unjustified condemnation, lies, and the constant fear that the work is going to run out and you won't have a job. I'm sure I left out something--did I mention sociopaths?"
Northrop Grumman,1c6o6v7peb8b69ki,3.0,"Typical day would include playing catch up due to the lack of coordination by management. I learned allot about ID and e-learning, no thanks to my supervisor, or any management. I was self taught the entire time I was working at this company. The management was very ""Micro"" and wanted allot of ""YES"" men working for them. The workplace culture is designed to be very work heavy and life last. So, the idea was ""Mission"" first and family/yourself last. The hardest part of the job was getting my fellow teammates to do their job. This was because my supervisor believed that the team was responsible for any slack by any teammates should be carried within the team regardless of the situation."

Northrop Grumman,1c6nfrj4rb8b68mr,2.0,"I worked at Northrop for over 10 years.  During that time I have watched great people and managers run away from this company.  On paper this place should be great.  Fantastic pay and benefits, company is winning new business constantly.  The problem is with the leadership and the people.  The company can’t drag themselves out of their old school government mentality and so only the low performer / lifers remain.  Everyone else goes on to work for better companies that take more of an interest in the growth and success of the company AND their people.  So the culture is very focused on not rocking the boat, keeping your head down, and hoping you can retire.  The company has no values, no heart, and they can’t plan / strategize their way out of a paper bag but they will spend 15-hour days talking about it."
Northrop Grumman,1c6lkjp3vb83dedd,3.0,good job secure bad management. This company has a really old school culture. This company lacks of management skills and career development. It could be better -

Northrop Grumman,1c6ag0l4ib86r8ho,5.0,"I joined Northrup Grumman as a contractor, so technically I didn't work for them, effectively they were who I dealt with on a day-to-day basis.  The management likes to tighten deadlines but with throw resources(people) at the problem when a risk to that deadline shows up.  Most of the developers I met were competent and helpful.

Northrop Grumman,1c4008ncg5j5d99j,3.0,"I have nothing bad to say about NG. My experience there was fair. The biggest challenge I faced was dealing with the negotiated dynamic with the client at the Social Security Administration (SSA). Even with a managerial position with the client, there is little authority to enforce policies.

Northrop Grumman,1c183jqua1fdn5mp,5.0,"OVerall, this has been one of the better places I have working at in the 20+ years I have been working.  The majority of the group I work with are talented and are knowledgeable about their job.  Like with any other profession and company, especially large ones, you will come across some that have no business being employed in the role they are currently in."
Northrop Grumman,1c17fip41b84iati,3.0,"Every group is different, so this might not apply everywhere, but it does in more places than not.  Promotions and higher titles have more to do with your years of experience and timing than what you produce.  That makes some of the higher ups complacent with their jobs, and some of the younger employees impossible to move up. If you just want to get by, this can work well for you.  If you want to advance, try looking somewhere else."

Northrop Grumman,1c1384icb0mtj2rq,4.0,The work/life balance at Northrop Grumman was great. You were able to take off on the days that you want and were able to work from home when you needed to. The management was mainly the issue at the location I was at. Some managers were able to manage projects accordingly and give development teams a chance at success but most of the time that was not the case. There was very little push back on client requests that were out of scope or would not be able to deliver on time. So a lot of over promising and under delivering was going on. The projects that were available were meaningful and you felt like you were going to impact a lot of people with your work.

Northrop Grumman,1btchbqa8brfnb7p,3.0,"There are a lot of different work cultures here but the one that stands out the most is Pride. Everyone here takes pride in what they do, and for the most part there is a significant talent pool here. The downside to that comes when management fails to recognize the hard work and dedication of individuals. Eventually everyone ends up looking for another job, due to the lack of compensation and or recognition, that could lead to a promotion. I do enjoy the people here, for the most part everyone is friendly and respectful."
Northrop Grumman,1btcg2lgh52v991v,2.0,Job satisfaction.  Difficult with the new rapid growth.  Becoming cutthroat with the new contract wins and rapid growth.  Going from 2500 employees at this location to over 7000.

Northrop Grumman,1bsmikh4saqj1asp,3.0,"NGAS is a good place to work, but the historical culture of fixing poor planning with mandatory overtime is a horrible mindset and extremely demotivating.  the tools are cumbersome to do the job, the networks and computing resources are way below acceptable for a company with the annual revenue.  leadership positions are not vetted appropriately."

I know not everyone has had the same experiences as me, but most high performers can find a path to success in this company.  I wish they had more of an emphasis on soft skills, but I think that is changing.  You'll work with some brilliant people here and often get to decide what you do on any given day."

Northrop Grumman,1brk50fsob872d1d,3.0,A typical day at NGSM is physically exhausting. The MSE is expected to forgo every other aspect of their lives personal and professional. In return the salary is reasonably high but the physical demands are such that once the MSE is worn out or injured there is no succession so they are tossed out as a defective unit to be replaced by another human who can be ground down and used up.

Northrop Grumman,1brde781b52u7amp,3.0,"Although I'm sure that there are other areas of the company that offer growth and expansion, I got thrown into a project I wasn't particularly crazy on or thought was relevant to my career... As a competitive student in Mechanical Engineering, I worked on Excel sorting through part inventories. I could tell that my functional manager felt bad for me being in this position (kind of a, what the heck are you doing here? Expression). High turnover and lots of (vocally) frustrated and burnt-out full-timers at my office, which was separate from the main campus. Felt pretty isolated, and it was a pretty unfriendly environment. I don't think anyone took their lunch break. There would be many days where I would speak to no one face to face... Just sitting in my cube staring at spreadsheets... But it paid well, and my mentor/dotted-line manager was a fun guy (too bad he'll be retiring soon). HR wined and dined the interns, we got a free lunch every week."
Northrop Grumman,1brca3qt9b870cfn,5.0,Start the day with a ME group meeting so management would inform everyone of important business for the day. Go to shop floor to coordinate with shop supervisor and assist them with any problems they are having and correct the problems.

Northrop Grumman,1br53njmlaki0e1f,3.0,"Many good opportunities for engineers.  Fewer opportunities to do interesting research and development.  Good salary and benefits. Immediate managers are good, executive leadership often makes decisions that cause chaos at the lower levels without regard for people having to accommodate that chaos.  High-level leadership does a poor job explaining actions and strategy."

Northrop Grumman,1br39sa5ib86lan5,3.0,"The people are great, but the company culture still has an old school mentality.  Management is overworked and they lack people leadership skills and training.  The work can be tactical and less strategy driven.  Overall, it's a good place to work, with good benefits.  The work can be dull, and it's very bureaucratic. ."
Northrop Grumman,1br2lpur6b82vasu,3.0,"This job was good but the overall industry is very boring and highly focused on antiquated processes. The technology is improving but there is a very high emphasis on security and that prevents implementing practical solutions. The environment is very slow and good for a starter job. There is also a high rate of turnover so the opportunity is there. However, they are not very good at working with your requirements unless you have been working there for a long time. I had a very long commute but still came to work at a decent time and got all the work that they asked of me done. However, they were fixated on the fact that I could not come any earlier to meetings that would last the entire business day and really were not relevant to me at all. I understand that you want me to get the full company experience but if I am performing my duties I believe that should be sufficient. Instead they told me that I was using my long commute as a crutch and basically did not want to hire me from there."

Northrop Grumman,1bqdrqub2breafh8,4.0,"NGC is a good company to work for but the environment for business is very competitive and the US government can be a very poor customer in regards to how it views it's contract work force.

More focused on quality and ethics than most, it's stodgy and bureaucratic - but they pay well and they do their best to keep you employed. If you're looking for good pay and job security, this is a good place to look. If you want an exciting and dynamic environment -- this probably isn't the place for you."
Northrop Grumman,1bkuptqqp5n93bjf,2.0,From a lower level management position having been with company  things have gotten worse with losing people after training them to do hands on work on product they always leave for better pay because the bottom line calls for lesser skilled lower payed mechanics . This hurts morale as you are always answering for blown budgets and extreme rework and scrap parts . Overall it is great place to be an engineer but all aspects of production and management are too stressful for the pay .insurance Benifits have dwindled considering out of pocket expenses has tripled over last 3 years .

Northrop Grumman,1bkmh7kf90mcj6p1,1.0,The Management is horrible to work with.  There is no room for advancement.  This job is more like working on a assembly line where everything is a rush.
Northrop Grumman,1bkma4bip0mtr4qi,2.0,"I worked here for 9 years in a non-engineering role.  Both of my managers during this time were authoritarian; neither offered much room for advancement which is ultimately why I left the company.  Work/life balance was pretty good; some overtime and weekends necessary but nothing too outrageous.  This company is a very old boy culture where I often heard women mocked for achieving higher level management jobs and where some of the older engineers would still make comments about the actions and appearance of women.  The bureaucracy at NGC runs deep and for such a large company, there are SO many people who are employed there because their mom/dad/uncle/whatever also works/worked there.  Sector mergers have led to a decrease in supervisor, lead and lower level management positions so mobility is limited unless you are are engineer.  The final comment is that HR has been outsourced so getting into NGC now is a nightmare with resume key word searches and multiple screening interviews before you even speak with a hiring manager.  When I left after 9 years, I was given a checklist to complete and my manager never once offered guidance about off-boarding."

Northrop Grumman,1becqsa8m52ub8o1,5.0,"On a typical day at work, for the most part I work independently on subcontract control for government property management.  Because I'm a more senior level, my projects are assigned in the beginning of the year and I coordinate site visits, conduct audits, and write reports.  I also interact with other staff in completing contactor self assessments and review files for completeness.  My manger is hands off unless there is an issue that needs intervention, which is rarely.   The culture in my immediate workplace is one where property management experts (most of which have 40 years experience) strive for excellence in everything that they do.  We are all detail oriented people and work together to achieve the best quality work product."
Northrop Grumman,1beal9va9b8b19i3,3.0,"After 30 years I would say the first 15 were great the next 10 were okay and the last 5 torture.  I feel sympathy for my younger co-workers; there is little chance for advancement and the work can be mind numbing.  The individual contributors are great but management is ""old school"".  They are drowning in procedures that are poorly written, hard to understand and constantly changing.  Every year the compensation package appears to shrink, and raises of 1-3% annually won't keep up with inflation.  The 9/80 work week is great but flex time is at your managers discretion and is offered only to a favored few.  The attrition rate at my division is high, and it takes months to hire anyone, IF they hire a replacement at all.  Employee surveys are given ""lip service"" no meaningful changes have come out of them and the results haven't improved in 5 years.  That speaks volumes."

Then, instead of Human Resources removing the manager(s) that cause the problems, they take dedicated and hard working employees and move them to places where they'll either be miserable and quit, or to a proposal which may not be won, so they can ""justifiably"" be laid off in the future."

Northrop Grumman,1b5lflbkh1bg17v9,3.0,"Northrop likes to talk a big game to its employees about how much it cares. Local management cares about its employees by offering a great work/life balance. This is excellent. But upper management cuts pay increases and benefits, all the while crying to employees that the economy is making them suffer, when, in fact, the company is doing quite well. Cutting of benefits and pay increases would not be so hard to swallow if the company were just honest with its employees about why they chose to make the cuts, instead of trying to pull the wool over our eyes. What's more, upper management started a new performance incentive program that makes it nearly impossible for staff employees on small contracts to win earn this award, while employees working high profile contracts are always front runners. What's worse is the incentive program makes it very easy for middle-to-upper management to receive the award, while it becomes much more difficult the further down the ""food chain"" you are."

It is a good, interesting job with decent benefits, but the compensation as a whole is lacking. Stay long enough and your pay will fall well behind the market rate. This must be the tradeoff for huge-corporation job security. Middle management is a mixed bag of old-timers who have their favorites and newer managers with good ideas and fresh perspectives. My engineering colleagues are some of the smartest people I've met and are generally easy to work with and care about the mission."

Northrop Grumman,1b2ef7ng5b86ee79,4.0,"The work is rewarding overall but the Management leaves quite a bit to be desired in some of the departments.

I enjoy the team and the team atmosphere.  It is a pleasure to come to work with seasoned professionals who love their job.
Northrop Grumman,1b0t6arg85nf7d8c,4.0,Family style working environment. Pride in making product by hand. Company rewords workers based on making company goals from month to month. Once you have been through all the polishing departments their isn't much left to learn
Northrop Grumman,1b0oanug6akbndrn,4.0,"I feel like I lost a family. The site managers looked out for its people, and we did our best to make it work for all of us.  Like all sites, it wasn't perfect, but we all knew what had to be done, and we had a team spirit going on (everybody accomplishing their duties and responsibilities). --- We all got the job done, and help one another to make sure everything got done, and to make sure we kept the Air Force satisfied. --- Yes, a family with some ups and downs, but what I sense today is that we have lost a key thing in business today - friendship & loyalty, but nothing last forever.

They have leaders and hiring managers that have been there 30+ years and REFUSE to change the ways of the past. Huge turnover issues in AS, poor leadership throughout the division, no one communicates what is going on to the field organization, they are depending on their name to attract people which once you join them you realize what a terrible mistake you made. If you want to work in this industry go to Boeing Harris, Raytheon or Lockheed."

When they bring in an employee from the outside of the company, they are willing to over pay that employee for a specific position.  When an internal employee tries moving up in the company, that's where the issues come in.  There is a lot of red tape with trying to move with in the company, you will only see 2-10% increase moving up (5%) is typical.

Now the political climate is one of fear and blame, engagement is lower than ever and older employees are being targeted to leave even though no one ever admits that is what is going on. It is a shame that a company that once valued experience now is so focused on meeting diversity targets that it structures incentives based on meeting these targets.

Management is extremely unprofessional: late, minimal communication and passive aggressive. Due to contract with Social Security Administration, culture is slow and ineffective. The work that you do is mostly busy work and hardly ever related to your current or desired workskills. Most folks in this location use it as a place to take classes and bide time before moving on. Pay is average."

Northrop Grumman,1apnt29kiak568un,3.0,"These are some of the , no, the worst healthcare benefits I have every had.  I hear that they use to have wonderful health benefits but they have taken a turn for the worst over the last four years.  You never know how much your doctor visit will cost because they do not have a co pay structure.  Instead of paying copays you are responsible for 100 percent of the cost until you meet your deductible, then after it is met you still have to pay 20 percent.  Gone of the days of paying 10 20 30 for prescriptions.  You also have to meet a prescription deductible first then pay 20 percent of what ever your meds cost. My guest is that the folks that are saying they have great medical benefits never worked for a company that truly had good benefits"

Northrop Grumman,1aiqe5ou21bgf071,1.0,"Complete and total lack of integrity and accountability at all levels of management. Annual employee surveys continue to point to overall discontent and dissatisfaction with the organization. Management's reaction is to form teams to address these issue which result in nothing being done as the issues are greater than what employees can directly fix. Compensation and benefits are a joke. Annual increases have averaged about 0 - 1.5% for the past 4 years with benefits following closely behind. Program Managers run and direct their teams in a very unprofessional and highly disrespectful manner. If they can make you look bad they will. They're only out for themselves and no one else. Good luck getting an ""atta boy""....ever. I could go on but I think you get the picture."

The hardest part of the job is getting the lower management to realize that there is no magic pill to fix the problem. Being part of history and building the next best ship for the NAVY is very fulfilling."

We would spend several hours each day to provide detailed status reports to present to them while having to do our primary job responsibilities.

Northrop Grumman,1a0vcunjfb80uebq,2.0,"Northrop Grumman has a severe problem keeping young talent around, and this will likely continue into the future. There's an old company culture with very conservative mindsets. I work in an IT group, and this company easily has the worst job culture compared to any anywhere else I've been. Examples: pay for your own coffee, no free lunches, business dress, expensive breakfast and lunches, and poor compensation. Three of the buildings I've worked in are little more than cube farms for entire floors, which tends to kill any chances employee interaction."

Northrop Grumman,1a0daah46b83nbmd,5.0,"It was the best place that I have ever worked in. If one worked their tail off it was worth it because the end product was a military concoction that saved many of our soldiers lives and that along amid itself was commendable and rewarding. During the time I've been there in California before the transfer of the program to Huntsville  Alabama I was presented with various awards and  accolades from the program managers I worked with. This was in the form of promotions, bonuses and recognition awards including cash. I was given free reign to use imagination and creativity to get things done. Quality worked arm in arm with the program itself and showed full support to help the program prosper. Other Quality Departments that I have worked for over the years were never that way and they stumped the progress rather than improve the situation. Perhaps this is why Quality overall is not well received by many people in the industry. If everyone is respected and qualified then there is no reason not to work in harmony."

The work was really exciting and the variety was exceptional, because the projects we performed for the U.S. Government were always changing.  I received a majority of my computer experience there--especially working with databases, and even wrote a little bit of code there, with Visual Basic.  That is certainly a company that I lament I couldn't have remained with until retirement.  But the war in Iraq took away a lot of military spending in the United States."

If your not a ""Northrop Employee"" your basically disposable. you get no benefits at all while your a contractor and most are required to be contractors at least 3 yrs before being considered for ""Full time"". The management is very poor and they do not support recently returning combat veterans struggling with PTSD or any other disability,all that happens is you becoming a hassle for Northrop Grumman and when its time to let you go, your supervisor takes the day off and they call you after work to let you know that was your last day. No warning, no courtesy 2 weeks NOTHING. EXTREMELY POOR UPPER MANAGEMENT"

But all in all, its very possible to find a comfortable niche working with good people and you can make a decent living, enjoy your work, put in a few decades, and retire comfortably some day.

Northrop Grumman,19pqqt5s75n9ha2t,4.0,"My typical work day would start with me working on whichever unit I was assigned to loft for the new aircraft carrier, the Ford. These drawings were modeled in CATIA and then pulled over to a computer program where fabrication documents for the waterfront were created. My primary job was lofting structure, which in short meant welding thickness and beveling on the T-bars/bulkheads per procedures for each of the thicknesses of the bars. I learned much from those around me as well as my supervisor, whom was very team oriented and driven. My coworkers were mostly men, which could be difficult at times, but very much a learning experience. They were all very experienced in their jobs and were excellent in helping me learn the job. The most difficult part of the job was making sure that the drawings were correct. If they were incorrect and something made it past the planners and to the waterfront, it could potentially be a severe problem for those building the ship and ultimately cause a work stoppage. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I was helping build a ship that would protect our country for decades to come."

Management doesn't provide enough guidance, or incentive for promotions. No room for growth. Not much in terms of job security, but that's the business of working in the defense industry. The pay is below average for an engineer in the Huntsville, AL area. Good place for a first job, but don't plan on making a career out of Northrop Grumman in the Huntsville, AL area unless you're in the ""in-crowd"". It's not what you know, it's who you know that gets you promoted."

Northrop Grumman,19p146tteak8nfku,2.0,"In general, technical staffing and succession planning has been a huge issue on many established programs.  A rash of employees leaving the company and retirements over the past few years coupled with slow hiring rates has left many engineering skill set gaps and program headcount shortages across the board.  Retention rates have dropped among new hires.  Program management and functional front-line managers handle staffing very poorly and often ignore the problem until their EV spreadsheets and schedule milestones are deep in the red.  The headcount shortages often leave experienced engineers stretched very thin and projects perpetually behind schedule.  Program management also has a hard time understanding that complex tasks requiring unique skill sets cannot be filled with new hires or interns without significant training which is often not budgeted for.  Compounding this problem is that contract proposals are written without concern for staffing or skillset availability/development.  There is a noticeable lack of communication between program management from different functional areas until serious staffing conflicts arise."

Northrop Grumman,19ndck6ftak7se21,4.0,"Northrop has a great job culture, benefits set, and resources for learning and development.  However, advancement basically works as such: to get a higher level position within your team, you must already be performing to such a capacity. Also, at any point beyond entry level jobs, NG doesn't pay competitively; a level 2 pays worse than a similar position requiring 2 years of experience elsewhere, level 3 worse than a position requiring 5 years, etc."

Little incentive for cooperative work relations between units.  Good pay/benefits. Like most publicly owned companies there is a ""what have you done for me lately"" feel from upper management.  Good training and educational opportunities. Within units the culture is determined by local management and front line leaders, most are good with employee and customer focus about right.  All in all it was a good place to work (many opportunities, mobility within company, leadership roles).....DoD budget cuts drove a ""greening"" of the workforce, but for 2 decades it was a good ride."

Northrop Grumman,19jgrmdmnb80p8k1,4.0,NG is your typical large aerospace contractor. Programs come and go every few years so you always have to be looking for your next job inside the company.

Northrop Grumman,19i852hneb80g8uf,4.0,"This has been a unique experience, as I have worked at the USMC and Aerospace divisions - with and without direct supervision.  I have been pushed to my limits - and maybe beyond on occasion.  This company is definitely for someone who does not want to ""rest on their laurels"".  There will be new challenges every day - and new expectations to fill (sometimes with no one having gone before you to show the way).  It is exciting and challenging, stressful and frightening - but ultimately, I believe, worth it.  The pay and benefits are competitive, but the review/bonus system needs some help - I understand that is a work in progress.  There are some of the greatest scientific/mathematical/engineering geniuses at work here at Northrop.  It is sometimes difficult to get out of meetings, and get to work, which can be frustrating."

The culture in the IS department is all about managers promising more than what can be delivered and punishing you when you inevitably fail.

All of his employee's were productive, loved to come to work each day and left with a smile on their face. Upper management reorganized our department and placed an individual in charge that never managed people. Needless to say, what was a wonderrful environment turned into one that was unhappy, disconcerned and couldn't wait for the day to end. My coworkers were the best. I couldn't have asked for better. Everyone got along even after the management change. The hrardest part of my job was wondering what the new management would find fault with.

The company has severely cut back on compensation and benefits.  Executives blame the recession and reduced government spending for these actions, but meanwhile the company is turning out record profits and the stock price has doubled.  If you are an engineer, this is probably still a decent company to work for.  But if you are any sort of support function (HR, Security, Accounting, Facilities, etc) it is a death trap.  Support functions (i.e. indirect) have been cut to the bone, with no relief in sight.  For such a large company, there is a severe lack of development and training programs."

Northrop Grumman,19btaqui6ak4gb3s,3.0,I gained a lot of great experience there. I also worked with some wonderful people. But there was a constant threat of a reduction in work force (RIF) that did a lot to destroy employee morale. The 9/80 work schedule was nice for the most part. Some of the management was decent while others were not necessarily qualified to manage other people. This can be a nice place to work if you choose the right job for your skill set. It looks good on a resume but don’t stay there too long. Other similar companies such as Boeing can be a substantially better place to work. Northrop has a reputation for not compensating fairly. The benefits are were decent but don’t let that fool you. I would tentatively recommend them as an employer but keep your resume updated they are losing major contracts by the day and outsourcing is big issue with this company.

During my time there i helped design the stowage elevator systems for the aircraft carrier CVN78. Getting to walk down to the shipyard and see my work first hand was astounding. It really made me take pride in all the work i accomplished there. We used programs such as inventor, AutoCAD and Catia. Iventor is the program i used the most and became the most proficient in. I created 3D models and 2D drawings of hatches, doors, elevator platforms and guarding. I was responsible for EIR's (electronic inspection reports) and also other database software in which we would vault our drawings once completed. I learned many aspects of ship building that i never thought possible."

This work was cowritten by myself and a NASA counterpart but I took control of it into any futher enhancements. One such unlucky notice was from IT secutity who wanted to validate the security on my system. I had already encrypted the user and password data so it was not readable. I told them it was based on a WWII code of prime numbers 3 aqnd 7 and -3 and -7 and thast was all I could tell them as everytrthing else was above their understanding. so they okayed my securuty and my way of data handling as I also had functions calls to particular hardware in the logistics environment for data input and export. As I was in the IT security building an IT secruity breach went off and the Manager there was a freind of mine so he noticed as everyone else was ""flying off the handle"" I was sitting there thinking so he asked me what I thought and I told him of four things that could be done to stop the securuty breach and he assigned two of his people to handle two of the things I thought up.

Being a major US defense contractor with multiple locations, I was expecting a highly professional atmosphere with competative compensation & benefits. What I was exposed to was a year of highly emotional management heavily pressuring employees in an industry which requires exceptional quality standards. It was not a pleasant experience at all. We were routinely asked to work upwards of 80 hours per week for little or no compensation. My co-workers would have been a great bunch of people to work with, if they weren't so stressed out all the time. The hardest part of the job was getting any time to spend with family.

Northrop Grumman,18khmv9jkb84gbqn,3.0,"A typical workday consist of many status update meetings and very little time to actually do you work.  You will learn that this company does not promote growth.  Everything you actually learn about engineering will have to be conducted on your own time.  Your coworkers are great because they are in the same miserable position that you are.  Many just want to make it a few more years into retirement.  The hardest part of your job is going to it.  The most enjoyable part of your job is leaving it.  Day-to-day, you will notice many VIP tours of customers and corporate hotshots walking through the labs observing you working. They'll expect you to explain what you're working on in remedial terms that they can understand.  You will have to keep your work area clean just in case they stop in unannounced.  Expect no opportunities to train and no mentors.  Work starts immediately when the contract gets funded but takes weeks to trickle through the finance unit until there is something an engineer can charge to.  Once those charge numbers are activated weeks later, you're already behind schedule.  There is a big push for employees to compete their engagement surveys about the quality of  your work environment.  From the results of the engagement survey, your group is supposed to come up with corrective actions. First, the corrective actions can not cost the company any money and second, must not be worked on during work time.  A proposal to train on personal time using company equipment was denied.  Actually, ever proposal put forth by our group has been denied.  It's an absolute mess."

Northrop Grumman,18hsp4ba3b84gdbo,4.0,"I was a member of a smart, flexible and knowledgeable team. We traveled to many U.S. locations and several overseas. Our site leader (management) showed care, concern, understanding and a sense of humor for job requirements that included: travel day to site, twelve hours on - twelve hours off for one to three weeks - travel day back home. The two best parts of this job were my co-workers and the look in the eyes of customers when our training was successful. My manager, a retired Command Sergeant Major, frequently reminded us that we were not training soldiers for war, we were training soldiers to return from war."
Northrop Grumman,18hr2rtnab80gbpp,5.0,The work day began at 5:30am with a review of the activities scheduled for the day. Learning to manage resources (human and lab) represented the challenges of a fast-paced program for the Armed Forces. The program managers were talented and rewarding to work with as well as the engineers supporting the effort. The greatest challenge was keeping the diverse and often changing Armed Forces representatives informed of and satisfied with program progress. Working through the 'hardest part of the job' was the source of the satisfaction with that program position.

Northrop Grumman,18hoo76u6ak4g8ks,5.0,"As an intern, I was given the opportunity to see a typical workplace for the first time. Much of the work-load depended on other processes/procedures to be completed so that some days were very relaxed and other days were more focused and occupied. I never had a day that was stressful, however. I learned materials planning procedures and learned how to use tools such as ZBUYR, SAP, and Microsoft Excel. Everyone who worked in my department and team was extremely friendly, nice, polite, and fun to be around. They obviously loved working with each other and anyone else they got to know. My favorite part was simply interacting with other workers and listening to their lives and past experiences. The hardest part of my job was that another intern and I had to count over 70,000 nuts, bolts, and screws using a small weight scale. The experience I had was definitely positive and enjoyable."

I truly enjoyed all my co-workers in this office, it was a very fun and pleasant work environment.

The other quality engineers in our team and I (there were three total) would just divide up the materials as they came into our lab. Unless priority materials were needed on the manufacturing floor, it was very much a FIFO system. I learned a lot about QC and how a manufacturing operation is supported by quality. Management was a non-issue because we were such a small group that we barely needed management. However, I felt that this was our major flaw, no group wanted to accept us as part of their team so we were often rogues of the larger quality department. When we had problems they often fell on deaf ears and Engineering often quieted our concerns."

The number of PTO days differs by sector but for IS it's 15 days which includes holidays and any time you take as sick/personal time.

The managers were also good people who took care of employees and any problems that came up. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customer who was the United States Post Office.

I managed the team that Issued and received MRAP vehicles for the soldiers when then there for training purposes.  My co-workers worked extremely closely together on a daily basis to get the mission completed.  This comprise of any emails, via teleconference calls to assist with the mission.  The most challenging part about my job was times when I couldn't provide the type of customer service I knew that I was capable of giving to the government due to budget restraints regarding certain tools that was needed to get the job done more proficient.  The most enjoyable time is when my employees work to provide the United States military with impeccable customer service that they wasn't expecting.

Northrop Grumman,1831mnvlub80g8c9,2.0,"The day to day work was challenging and rewarding. I learned a lot of office skills from the plethora of e-learning programs that were set up by corporate. The company also provided many other training and qualifying programs. They also provided good but expensive benefits (dental, health, life insurance, and many different retirement plans). I was not impressed with the management in this company or the HR department. They were secretive, incompetent, and seemed to turn a deaf ear to employee complaints. When the company decided to close down our branch, the employees heard about it on the local news rather than from upper management. They also did a wonderful job at keeping us guessing when the branch was going to officially close by changing the closure date many times, sometimes without informing the employees. Many of my co-workers, like management, were also incompetent and under-qualified for their positions. The hardest part of this job was dealing with them on a daily basis. The best part of the job was the decent pay and benefits."

Northrop Grumman,182crsrvsb84g88s,3.0,"Communications could use improvement. LA area too expensive to live near company sites. Company should strongly consider moving as many of their operations from California to Florida/no tax state. Management should allow and embrace remote/virtual work for employees living close to other company locations and eliminate need for daily face-time when not necessary. This will help to reduce number of cars on the road, emissions, and gas and wear/tear on cars. It will also help to improve work/life balance and moral of employees having to deal with the millions of cars and long commutes through extreme and unsafe weather conditions at times. Long hours already expected, but those of us having to commute into LAX, have an additional 4+ hr day thanks for the commute times! If the company wants to retain employees in these kinds of work locations, they need to be more flexible and not try to chase good people away."

Although the project was long term, it was time for me to get off the road.  Most of the guys I was on the road with were burnt out and it didn't help when we didn't have replacement, but instead management rotated us in and out of those military treatment facilities.  The company was small and we had access to the developers and network engineers to support us while on site.  In the end, Northrup Grumman bought out the company and I left a few weeks after."

The company has a very good reputation on a national level and it might be a good place to work at a different location.  However, my experience was not a good one from the start.  I was told I would receive on day one 17 days of vacation  a year that I could bank for up to two and a half years and cash out when needed.  I was never told that I would actually have to accrue these days, which was approximately 11 hours a month.  After being at the company about a year I found out I was pregnant.  Trying to find out information regarding leave and Short term diability was a nightmare!! The local HR rep was useless, every question I asked her I was told to call the corporate HR hotline.  They were just as useless! I was given the run around for months regarding what i thought was a simple question, ""What exactley is my STD benefit, 100% pay for 6 weeks and 50% after that?"""

Program-level management is usually aware of your productivity, however, functional management (manager who is responsible for your review, professional growth, training) is too far removed from the program and is not aware of your day-to-day performance.

The only bad thing is depends on whose in office (read: Democrats are not good for the job or your career as they pull funds) and if there is a war (as this pulls money from research & development and all the fun stuff to the troops). Contrary to popular opinion DoD government contractors make more money in peace time. Overall a great job if you're a software/electrical embedded software engineer and good at what you do."

Northrop Grumman,17bb2qo0rae0gflo,5.0,"A typical day at work was sending out RFQs, placing orders, any others specialized projects that popped up had to have special attention. I learned many things in the Procurement world. Learning about terms and conditions was an ongoing process, I learned bits and pieces about import/export, a bit about foreigjn orders and lots of other things that don't come immediately to mind. I was able to strengthen my negotiating skills. I really enjoyed working with my suppliers. I had some really good relationships. The hardest part of the job was to make everyone happy. I had so many REQs on a daily basis that it was tough keeping up. They can age quickly and it's not always easy buying those parts in a timely manner. Due to obsolence, price, delivery, and others issues made it sometimes difficult to get parts when needed. Also any supplier that would not accept NG's T&Cs, was tough because neither party wanted to make concessions. Very challenging. I loved my co-workers. There was some really good management and some not so good. I personally do not like micro-managers. I like to be able to do my job and not be micro-managed. I also like to have management that is accessible when needed. It was a stressful jobs at times, but I really enjoyed it and loved learning new things."

It is a challange to manage Grumman workers while traing sailors on the E-2D. o-workers are great. We have worked to gether so long that we can read each other and we all help out one another when one is needing help. Hardest part of the job is when there is an incredable amount of work that needs to be done, and sometimes you have to do it by yourself because everyone else is busy.

I learned how to navigate my way around a ship, how to hook-up some electrical devices. management was spotty some were very knowledgeable and others had positions because of who they knew instead of what they knew. at times when a question about how to do something was brought to some foremen they didn't know how to do the task in question. co-workers ranged just because of the amount of co-workers that were there some of the older co-workers didn't like the apprentice program and they took it out on the apprentices but for the most part everyone was friendly and helpful. the crew that I worked with was like a family they had known each other for years and they welcomed anyone new in with open arms. I created relationships that will last forever. the hardest part of the job was at times there were multiple crafts trying to work in the same area and it would be difficult to get daily tasks accomplished. the most enjoyable part was days when we had to pull big cables and they called on our crew. they put our crew together with guys that did all the heavy-lifting thinking that they would get the apprentices to quit because of the ""hard-work"" but those were the times when we did our best work because we got to work together as a team. we had fun while we worked but we always worked safe and with a gameplan that always got the job done."

When those customers were satisfied, I began arranging the current tickets with the oldest first, but prioritized in an order of importance. I very much liked all but my last manager, however I never revealed that, as I always treat my superiors with respect. The company went through nearly as many management changes as the number of years I served there. My co-workers were all hardworking and knowledgeable individuals that I considered part of my friendship pool. Being at the top-level of support for some of the issues I ran into made obtaining assistance impossible, but the Internet was always there for research and reference manuals. The smiling faces of customers that I've successfully assisted are the rewards I reap."

I managed a $52M budget; learned an extradionary amount of management information; refined my people skills and brough the department together (which consisted of 6 different business [Sectors]) across the United States and 3 European offices.

Northrop Grumman,17242dij64dsg9jv,5.0,"I started at Northrop Aerospace in 1985 way before it became Northrop Grumman. I left in 1992 to go to the Commercial Division when the company split and the Commercial Division was acquired by Vought Aerospace. I have often said since my departure from Northrop Grumman, it was the best work environment I've had the pleasure of being a part of. Just a wonderful, awesome place to work during that time. When one speaks of ""teamwork"" it was in every sense of the word when I was there. Everyone was invested in your success and people had your back. I was allowed more opportunities there, when just starting out in my career, than I've had since and now I have more education (which I most I received while at Northrop Grumman) and much more experience. A typical day included being a part of creative, brainstorming meeting, attending workshops, on many occasions got to teach soft skills classes, spent countless hours on the shop floor interacting with the mechanics inquiring about what we could do (in human resources) to make their work performance/job better to From management, I learned about teamwork and doing an excellent job and not stopping until the work was done...I learned some of my greatest work ethics at the company. I didn't know it then but Northrop Grumman/Vought has been the measurement stick I've use against every other company I've worked at and so far none has measured up. From my co-workers, I learned about working together collectively to get the job done. When they said it would be done, it was done. We were not only accountable to ourselves but to each other as"

Our management team was up in New York so we did not see them that offen but they always support us on anything that we had going on.

After 2008, things began to sour and the culture changed for the worse. Management turned away from research and development and instead focused on short term goals.

Northrop Grumman,170i4e2194e0gdeh,5.0,NGC was a pressure cooker. the management is constantly on everyones case to get it down. It has wasted and squandered millions of dollars and has no backbone when it comes to dealing with their suppliers. The management is more concerned about meeting their targets for their metrics so they can get their big bonuses rather than do a superior job for the customer. Also they are afraid of the customer and never ever oppose the customer on anything. It is sad.

The company as Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding was only mildly better than it was as Huntington-Ingalls Industries. Because Northrop Grumman had a Corporate office that provided limited oversight of its sectors, there was a bit more corporate responsibility expected; therefore, shipyard management had to follow a protocol that provided some fairness and parity. Under Northrop Grumman, there was more job security, as well, due to the stability of the corporation.

I didn't believe I needed one or had any concern as these were people I had worked with for over 10 years and considered friends. I was very wrong. Upon returning to work the situation started at being told I must still be brain damaged and proceeded over time to being told my memory was just fine and that I was just failing to perform.

Northrop Grumman,16butuko000007ki,5.0,I relly enjoyed the people at NGC in the IT dept. Had to close a business down in St. louis and my position was filled. Would go back if position opens up.
Northrop Grumman,16bbh7rc0000053j,4.0,"As my first job out of college Northrop was a great company to start with. They have a great tuition assistance program and helped pay the full cost of my Masters degree. Also, Northrop is a great corporation to put on a resume and is general well respected in the defense community."
Northrop Grumman,168e1nvc800003di,5.0,Excellent inspectors seeking zero defects. Great QA team members
Northrop Grumman,168do8ge800000lm,4.0,Executive Management Culture:
Northrop Grumman,16323pceg00003j9,5.0,"I would recommend this company, Good management and communication. What you put into it, you get out, advancements is a plus. Great Training. Benefits are good also."
KBI Biopharma,1bi9918ufakglfcq,2.0,"No work/life balance. I worked several weekends with no compensation as I was saleried. No extra pay, no days off. Turn over was high and the hours were long with no benefit.  Life events (such as heart conditions or sick pets) were frowned upon."
KBI Biopharma,1f5mcrvf3u4lu800,1.0,"The facility is too small for what they are trying to do. There are not enough staff to handle the work, not enough space to operate, poor management in my department and you are over worked."
KBI Biopharma,1f4acleshu392800,1.0,You'll get plenty of work to do and can expedite your career growth. Best to get as much experience as you can and get out. Job security is decent since there are always dumpster fires.
KBI Biopharma,1f3vhbp30u20v800,2.0,If you are fresh out of college or looking to move into pharma from another stem field this is a great place to learn instrumentation and more cutting edge techniques because they will have you up and running on them within a few weeks whether you like it or not.
KBI Biopharma,1erut52gv3ogl000,3.0,"There is no limit to what you can learn at KBI if you have the drive an time.  Tons of different assays and protocol are at your hands.  KBI prefers to promote internally for management positions even when qualifications aren't met.  This causes strain on the analysts with a break neck work flow on top of a massive work load.  Perhaps it will change in time, but more qualified managers need to be brought in to help the analysts."
KBI Biopharma,1eq50unbtsa99800,2.0,KBI is a company that knows that it is bad.  It is a unique level of self awareness that keeps anyone new from gaining too much ability to change anything for the better because management knows you will eventually leave.  The ones that have been the longest have done so by maintaining a toxic work environment that leaches every bit of energy from you before they eventually discard you. On the bright side this mess of a place allows for new graduates and early career starters a great entry point into industry due to the lightning fast turnaround time.  I was lucky enough to be one of those individuals to get a chance to get a good feel of the pharmaceutical industry and now I am an even luckier individual to leave.  My biggest advice is to get in and expose yourself to all of the areas that you can so you can leverage that knowledge to get a job somewhere that cares about you as a person and understands the benefits of strong company culture and fostering professional growth.
KBI Biopharma,1ekaku4t3t3qb800,1.0,HR policies are not good. They don’t care about employees. Employees are treated with disrespect and there is no work life balance. They keep on finding mistakes in your work and keep hammering it in every review. Such a pathetic company to work for.
KBI Biopharma,1ejm0r8veu2v7800,3.0,"Decent company culture. Somewhat fast paced. Technology is a bit antiquated, and processes could use some updating. Great place to get your feet wet in the BioPharma industry."
KBI Biopharma,1eige23huof3u800,4.0,I worked the night shift. My crew was filled with guys who had animosity towards other coworkers. Several poisonous personalities. Lots of people left after I left to work elsewhere.
KBI Biopharma,1edaadkb4p2ng800,1.0,"If you want to get your foot in the door in the pharmaceutical industry, apply here. If you just want a paycheck...do the same. However, if you plan to leave the company, disregard everything that you learned. If you care and have a great work ethic, you will be frustrated on a daily basis due to lack of proper management in most areas. You will also be frustrated by lack of positivity as you will hear a bunch of complaints. No true Quality professionals should apply here unless you just need to pass the time and collect a check. It could be a much better place if management were changed."
KBI Biopharma,1ed2dklunovgi800,1.0,The workers there like to invade your privacy.  They like to steal.  They do not get punished for it.  Depends on the person caught stealing HR will not help.
KBI Biopharma,1ebo7afbk3boj000,1.0,This has to be the worst management team I have ever been around. Literally! The manager and supervisor are never on the work floor or doing anything. They play favorites some are high key prejudice and advancement is nearly impossible. The team gets deviations everyday. If I was anyone applying for a job i would stay far away from this Place. I would give 0 stars if I could.
KBI Biopharma,1e9hr8cpj3cp3000,5.0,They hire you as who you are and mold you to become who they want with adequate training. Everyone is trying to help you integrate into the team. You can learn more stuff especially if you're new in the bioparma field. Just come in with the right mentality and good work ethics and you're all set.
KBI Biopharma,1e6hqftmkouni800,2.0,Work Life Balance isn't a HIGH value at the Company.
KBI Biopharma,1e37tjf85o27k802,2.0,There is a very toxic work environment in which negativity is pervasive.  Climbing the ladder is slow and degree-dependent.  Overtime is expected but not rewarded.
KBI Biopharma,1e2105smdhctm802,3.0,Very busy with daily tasks but pay and opportunity for better remote structure is highly needed.
KBI Biopharma,1e122i596hd5d801,1.0,"If you would like to retain any self worth or value when you head home for the day, don't work here. After being laid off, this was one of the only places willing to hire me quickly. After a few months of working here, I soon realized why; the quality of work and the company itself is so poor, nearly everyone begins to find a new job within about a year of working here. It would be very rare to see a scientist that has more than a few years of experience that has found the will and determination to brave the exhaustive and oppressive work environment long enough to be promoted. The lack of experience in management and rampant disorganization permeating the entire company infuriates the strongest of souls and slowly eats away at any prospects you would have to develop a career at KBI."
KBI Biopharma,1dro9thsg24e9003,3.0,"As a CRO, there is always incoming work. However, as the company has grown, there is less value on employees as individual assets. Instead, my department became heavily driven by revenue only, leading to overworked and undervalued employees.  It can also be difficult to move up in title/salary depending on which group/department you are a member of.  Some departments-- finance, manufacturing, program management-- seemed to have many more promotions than Analytical and formulation departments.  I was also told that I could not receive a promotion until I headed a method development study-- the only problem is my small group did not do such activities and were never given such contracts/studies to perform, making me feel stagnant in the position I was currently in."
KBI Biopharma,1dp8e45v9h3tn802,4.0,Great Company to work for in RTP.  Growing fast and hiring.  Strong company in there sector.  Would encourage people to work there.  Local company gone big.
KBI Biopharma,1dl5glcs224g6000,3.0,"Overall, compensation and benefits are fair. Work environment is pleasant.  Advancement opportunities are limited.  They offer alot of extracurricular team building opportunities."
KBI Biopharma,1diq30f9vh3v0800,1.0,"If you have to work here, and you are halfway intelligent, dedicate your off-time to finding a new job. You will not do any science here. It’s more like being a gerbil on a wheel."
KBI Biopharma,1bi9918ufakglfcq,2.0,"No work/life balance. I worked several weekends with no compensation as I was saleried. No extra pay, no days off. Turn over was high and the hours were long with no benefit.  Life events (such as heart conditions or sick pets) were frowned upon."
KBI Biopharma,1dh5ki7b8b8aa801,4.0,"Under valuing, and under utilization of most employees. Difficult and extremely inefficient work space that never improved! Extreme disconnection. No effort by upper management to create teamwork or company atmosphere.  Rarely on-site.Lots of talent under the roof that was never brought together."

KBI Biopharma,1d7kgcdtn1bg9000,4.0,"A roller coaster of challenges, changes, customer demands in a supportive environment where management with their eclectic sense of humor but driven attitude achieves miracles on an ever changing timeline."
KBI Biopharma,1d2bpejuraqhf800,1.0,"KBI is a sinking ship, the HR is a total mess."
KBI Biopharma,1cn4s5ubr5j5b87g,3.0,Very stressful work environment.  You may not ever get an opportunity to get a raise.  People are placed in positions that are not qualified.  What's promised is never given.
KBI Biopharma,1chjpm9olakcibmn,1.0,Its is a job. There is nothing else that I can say about working for this company. Its more about who your friends are that the quality of your work.  Being on the secret gossip email chain is the key to sucess.
KBI Biopharma,1cc4hi02vaqgpave,1.0,"Poorly managed facility which will be out of business soon.  Employees have no experience, training, or professionalism.  No organization or plans for the facility."

KBI Biopharma,1bs6rcu13ak6l8b4,3.0,This company is going through serious transition.  Management is out of touch with employees. It's great for a new college grad or Seasoned Vet looking for a paycheck.
KBI Biopharma,1bj5mpjpo5n8hclg,3.0,There are many great employees at KBI. However management and communication are ineffective and need to be improved.  Advancement really depends upon which department you work in and who you work for.
KBI Biopharma,1bhg9vuja5n9cb9p,4.0,"I was temporary contractor helping them do IT work for a week so I can't speak too much about what it is like there. But from what I saw and experienced, it was a friendly and nice place to work."
KBI Biopharma,1bdsqdkqeak5p9r2,1.0,"An incredibly disorganized company....seems like there is no one in charge.  Management only cares about profit and not following any proper procedure.  Company is devoted to those in their 20s and older, experienced, workers are denigrated."
KBI Biopharma,1b9esl180ak9afg8,3.0,Its a growing company with a lot of opportunity .The managers lack direction.I learned a lot in the field starting off but it started to become stagnant after a while.The workplace is inconsistent because its newer and the foundation its shaky.
KBI Biopharma,1b8ibstsa5nae83r,3.0,"This is a growing company and there are lots of opportunities to improve efficiency, as many processes were not scalable when implemented Management is decent. Compensation is fair."
KBI Biopharma,19l0fo6glak9ecjt,3.0,Good start up company when I worked there.  Business plan has changes significantly since I left the company in 2007. Most of the original management is still there.
KBI Biopharma,19fer3n7d5n8g9ve,3.0,"There is definitely job security at KBI for anyone who can do the work.  The culture is very friendly, however there are the general challenges of working for any CRO"

Sage Hospitality,1f2psi8e5him2800,4.0,Choose to be happy. The company will treat you well. Pros and cons of working everywhere. Nice people mostly helpful. I’m a happy person and don’t let people get me down. I enjoyed working there.
Sage Hospitality,1estkue95sa2t800,4.0,"I was the lead barista for a Sage property in Nashville. The job was easy. However, for my experience I Brough to the company I feel I should have been more valued as an employee. Management was easy to work with and corporate level employees were respectful and professional. I would work for Sage again, but not for the pay I was offered."
Sage Hospitality,1epbg8bm1t4h0800,5.0,I miss working at the Logan I have learned so much from this hotel and liked the whole team that I worked with as always was on time loved going to work and getting my job done was my passion at the Logan

You get to schitch station as you go about your day depending on whats need be done! You can move around freely and you can either prep cook help out in the walk in freezer diswasher cafeteria sweep mop help keep place looking nice clean beautyfull! It was a pleasure to recieve the executive chef in a sanitized well organized kitchen! Id loved this place!
Sage Hospitality,1ekkttluiu1t7800,5.0,The hotel I work for is fun and inclusive. Our GM is very hands on and teaches. I became a manager with Sage at the start of Covid. Company and management give you the tools you need to succeed. I've been with the company for 8 months and it has been the best career move for me. Thank you Sage for giving me the chance to get hands on training and allowing me to part of the team
Sage Hospitality,1ei4kv5per53c800,1.0,My interview was great with the chief of engineering  but I sensed some tension from the assistant GM she was very cold and short. My first month working there I realized it was the most ghetto unprofessional toxic place ever! People were sleeping with one another drinking and smoking every department acted like children gossiping about this gossiping about that! I was appalled and disgusted. The hotel itself was horrible condition inside and out quite surprised the amount they charged for guest to stay at such a place. About 2 months later they switched management company’s but still same BS. I expected so much more. Shockingly never really had problems with the guest more so just co workers
Sage Hospitality,1eh7tl2o0oh51800,4.0,I credit my time working at several Sage properties to where I am in my career now.
Sage Hospitality,1egk9n0k7bfjv800,1.0,"Poor organizational leadership and corporate direction, most are overly concerned with saving money at the expense of old and low-end  technology, problematic applications, and inadequate staffing levels, which include low or non-existent bonuses. And when occupancy rates and hotel traffic dropped, the layoffs immediately started, not even providing the normal industry standard 2 weeks notice/severance. Extremely poor character organization to separate loyal employees in such a manner."
Sage Hospitality,1ed4eojq0rmog800,4.0,It was good place to work. I went there with no knowledge in new field of Hospitality but I was given the chance to learn. Management was good; Management willing to offer education to prepare me for work. Work culture was welcoming to all. The hardest part of work was dealing with anger and unsatisfied customers. And the enjoyable part of the job was meeting people of different background every single day.
Sage Hospitality,1ebp018oopbhq800,5.0,"Everyone at Sage cares about people, they want to help everyone they can and make the process easy and positive."

Sage Hospitality,1e5ar5qt0qbq7802,3.0,The job was ok and easy. Lot of work but the team is great. I worked there for a little over a year and left to get more pay. If you like hotel work this is a good place to start.
Sage Hospitality,1e4fb01q3o13i803,4.0,Unfortunately my experience ended rather abruptly due to the Covid 19 pandemic.  I had some health issues that inhibited my ability to work to the level of effectiveness for my position.  At the six month period I was let go during the company furlough and was told I would not be re hired.  This is unfortunate and I will be seeking help from H.R. to see if I can return in the future.
Sage Hospitality,1e3nb0oh5otin803,5.0,"Great work environment, great team, great benefits. Sage wants to see you grow within the company and they are willing to give you the tools needed to progress in your career."

Sage Hospitality,1e071dk7vo1or802,5.0,I enjoyed working for Marriott. The workplace was a positive one. Management was supportive. Manpower was always a problem since most hotel jobs vary by season.
Sage Hospitality,1dvhuhd7b4rmh803,2.0,It appears that Sage has lost their way.

Sage Hospitality,1dqurse3hh42n802,3.0,"Due to new company direction, the position I held is being eliminated with no opening to retain me at my present salary. Sage it a progressive company."
Sage Hospitality,1dpva7udf5j5g802,5.0,If I could I would work there again
Sage Hospitality,1dpinfiv45n9f808,5.0,"I've worked for various hospitality companies, and I can say BY FAR that Sage has been amazing!  I feel supported on a property level as well as from our Corporate Office.  Our property is able to make individual decisions that benefit our staff, culture and of course our clients as well.  In over 3.5 years here, I have been through many changes at this hotel, and all have been executed collaboratively.  My favorite part of the culture here is how many people explore opportunities in different departments than they were originally hired for - lots of room to grow and find what makes you successful!"
Sage Hospitality,1do3cihedh417802,5.0,My days weren't horrible. Some days were better than others. I enjoyed a lot of my co-workers. The head management is very professional and generous. The lower management on the other hand could have at the time used a few adjustments. But then again nobody is perfect. The hardest part of the job was keeping busy during slower seasons. The most enjoyable part was being able to meet a bunch of new people from around the world.
Sage Hospitality,1dmodsuhqh3ot800,1.0,"Senior management doesn't care how many hours middle management works and will take little to no action to help or assist in daily operations. ""Leadership meetings"", daily meetings and unrealistic demands for deadlines drown you while daily operations compete to do the same while your GM shops online, looks for houses and goes out to eat for 2 hour lunches. Lack of supervision from corporate over senior"
Sage Hospitality,1dlkg961d5nd3802,3.0,Be aware to work for sage Means no advancement for labor workers. No employee meals even though there are two eateries on location. Pay is really low for downtown. You will need two jobs or a roommate to make it by. No promotions have been offered and its been a year! Everyone is super relaxed and cool to work with. The job is great But the Pay is horrible
Sage Hospitality,1dl3j3h6c24fm001,3.0,"Wages were lower than expected for the amount of work asked of you at times and raises from annual reviews were low as well. High turnover rate and Sage doesn't like to pay employees overtime unless your department was short staffed. Everyone was friendly and you tend to know everyone in other departments, but there was lack of communication from higher ups."
Sage Hospitality,1djcvbonnh47j806,3.0,"Sage is a solid company. Some areas they could improve upon are compensation, interdepartmental communication and collaboration."
Sage Hospitality,1djckuejdh47j801,1.0,"""Perception is everything"" is a phrase that was taught over and over, and it is resemblant of the interview process. When I interviewed I was very excited to be a part of a high class establishment. When I began working, I would be reprimanded for doing things incorrectly though I had not been trained on proper procedures. A typical day at work involves figuring it out yourself with flippant or no training. The hardest part of the job was no support and easily becoming a scapegoat for someone who had minimal interaction with their department and has no respect from their department."
Sage Hospitality,1dih6suqb5ncu800,2.0,"Company motto praises integrity but Sage does not practice what they preach. Upper management lacks hotel knowledge & diversity and I am amazed at how they stay in business.  Employees are not treated fairly, and are overworked. Company has no concept of employees work load and they are expected to perform  multiple job duties in short periods of time.  Try to complain and you risk termination.They do not like to pay overtime. Work here at your own risk."
Sage Hospitality,1di8o18d024e3002,5.0,Boy i missing working with sage. A great company reliable. You always had a team to support you. Only downfall was the pay for the work you do. If the can match other offers from competitive company would be the perfect job!!!
Sage Hospitality,1dhh6gn6ih3tp802,3.0,This was an okay employer however they lack in management. We had a manager that knew the store had worked there for 2 years and they put another manager above them because of race yes I said race. The store crumbled & Glad I'm gone will never waste my time with anything like this again.
Sage Hospitality,1dgv9d06c5j63800,5.0,Team oriented and positive work environment. Great hospitality management company . I am greatfu working with sage hospitality. Our manager are very friendly and helpful with our needs
Sage Hospitality,1dgi2adnv52tu802,5.0,"A typical day at work can be both hard and enjoyable, the people there are almost like family. We talk ,we laugh, we help each other,If there is a problem that we can't handle supervisor will step in"

Sage Hospitality,1dgaq04vl24gr001,1.0,"First of all the lobby was not at proper temperature. This place lacked passion, customer service, team work, integrity, security. Too laid back and not effective. Truly embarrassing to work at. Felt ashamed. My suggestion did not matter."
Sage Hospitality,1dfep8pf124gh000,5.0,Great company to work for if you are in Denver area.  I was in the take over team where we worked long hours and not enough support.  They only give less than 3% increase in your yearly review.
Sage Hospitality,1deouvb6hbrdo800,3.0,"Specifically, the Napa Marriott is run by very crude managers, neither care about their employees. The assistant manager often just overworked because she herself is afraid of the office manager: who lashes out at employees constantly and humiliates them both in private and in front of guests. I was hired as a part-time Front Desk and worked more than 40 hrs/week, each shift at least 9hrs."
Sage Hospitality,1ded99qr7h414805,3.0,"Hotel was eventually sold, but I got out before that happened. Was promised movement on a regular but never happened. I knew more than my manager. But the location was amazing, the MGT was amazing, Corp was great. The job itself was just low wages throughout the industry."
Sage Hospitality,1deamvtlvh3l5800,5.0,Sage has offered me the opportunity to grow personally and professionally. We have a very collaborative environment and the company fosters a very positive working environment.
Sage Hospitality,1ddeltsov5j6t800,1.0,The general manager is a inept idiot.  He swares he knows all even though he was fired from another hotel in Atlanta and didnt even go to Gm training cant run front desk cause he say he dont know how cant even change a room from dirty to vacant ready in the system but hes a GM REALLYLOL.   If you do be mindful he will micromanage you.  Make passes at you. Lie on you and tell lies to cooperate to get his butt out of hot water..HR is a joke cooperate doesnt even investigate what goes on with employees but will run lower management out the building.  No monthly dinners no talking no thank you but dont be late they will cut your head off...trust me dont work there. ..that place is a joke
Sage Hospitality,1dc2s1s2s24ge005,3.0,"Beautiful Hotel, Just low pay and it can be very stressful at times like all hotels in the world.  But sometimes it can be rewarding, especially when your working with great Co-workers that go on-and beyond.  The pay needs to be higher, health benefits need to be revamped."
Sage Hospitality,1dbiudv5j24f9000,5.0,I recommend everyone to stay this hotel because you will get a good service. I worked here as a maintenance engineer and I recommend a person who I know a technician one to join it.
Sage Hospitality,1d994hcsc5n8m800,5.0,Working at Sage was satisifing and yet challenging in all aspects.  The Executive Management at Sage is one of the best that I hav experienced.  It is a place where they know who you are as an employee. I would highly recommend Sage as an emnployee.
Sage Hospitality,1d7pok6821ah9000,2.0,Management was awful. Had four GMs in my year of being at the location. Assistant manager only cared for themselves and lacked communication. Confrontation was something she did not like especially when guests were yelling and screaming at her staff. She was about retaliation and was very into your personal business than motivating her staff.
Sage Hospitality,1d2gksf3f1ba4000,1.0,"Management treats you as if you are incompetent. 30 minutes to clean a room, regardless of its condition. A lot of talking down to housekeeping. Management treated me as if I was an unintelligible foreigner."
Sage Hospitality,1cp7aufq9ak68800,5.0,"Great work environment and company culture.  There are many opportunities for advancement, especially in Denver where Sage manages multiple hotel properties."
Sage Hospitality,1cnct1dh1akcs8p2,4.0,Sage cares about their employees and believes in promotion from within. The benefits are very slim which is hard when you have such great hotel discounts. Overall a good culture and staff.
Sage Hospitality,1cl50ebv31ba1654,4.0,"Room for growth, it was ok, need more productive Management. Pay employee a better wage for the work that is require of them. Take care of your employees and your employees will take care of you."
Sage Hospitality,1cl2nsj9cakglb3i,5.0,"Sage Hospitality has a great culture, focussed on the hotel operations and the communities they operate in.  Associates are an important part of their mission and their operations are quality driven.  Work life balance could be better for the executive team."
Sage Hospitality,1cf8diuipb85v9af,5.0,Great company to work for! Offering several opportunities with the expansion of their hotels. Wonderful leaders to work for and a great culture and people are very appreciative.
Sage Hospitality,1cf3iu2q9b85jf0l,4.0,"A typical day at work includes preparing the dish pit, cleaning all pots and pans, communicating with chef about any issues. I learned how to prep food items, how to be a good communicator. The management was not bad, worked around your schedule and allowed time off. The hardest part of the job could be pressure under a fast pace. The most enjoyable part was the people."

Sage Hospitality,1ca7gg849ak8ucfp,2.0,"Turnover is very high.  No set schedule if your working on certain positions.  Some managers are great, other higher ranking managers of the hotel are so inexperienced for their roles.  No hotel director during the weekends which seems pretty odd.  Most workers do pretty much whatever they want.  Too many slackers, and of course you have other good hard working people there too."

The perks are great and the leadership is transparent. They do a great job of highlighting promotions and celebrating wins throughout the organization, even though there's thousands of employees across the country. For example, there's an update that goes out every week to celebrate promotions, community service projects people participated in, even when celebrating when employees welcome a new baby to the family-- we all get to celebrate each others wins and happy moments, even if I don't work side by side with each other."

Sage Hospitality,1bnpcf1ksak4jdte,4.0,"The answer was always ""You need to cover the shift.""  ""We work a minimum of 10 hours every day no matter what.""  During the interview process, same management boasted about the quality of work/life balance.  As a department manager, I understand the needs to cover shifts but other management could also lend a hand.  Instead they take multiple vacations and ""work from home"" which doesn't make sense for a hotel manager. I constantly work over 60+ hours a week with many back to back shifts.  Days off are few and far between."

Sage Hospitality,1bhbo2eg6b8bmda7,1.0,"Starts out well.  Promise the world and micromanage the heck out of you. Typical day includes being micromanaged by the hotel GM. Learned that if they want you gone they will find a way. Restaurant GM is high functioning and fair. Hotel GM is a micromanaging piece of work with low morals. Sage corporate seems fair, but needs to rein this property in. Hardest pat of the job is the hotel GM. Some of the mid management and employees are great people that deserve so much better. Clique of restaurant morning staff with no morals whatsoever.  Knowing what I know now I can honestly say, if you aren't desperate for work, don't bother. You'll regret it!"
Sage Hospitality,1bguhldjcakdbff2,1.0,"Tons of favoritism, nobody stands up for what's right, and you barely getting hours to make a decent living. Cliques in every department, tons of gossip, and not many happy employers. They'll go above and beyond for guests, but not for the employees who contribute to daily operations and guest experiences. Management sucks BIG TIME!"
Sage Hospitality,1bg99u6cpakgv90v,1.0,"I worked here for almost a year. No supervisors in the beginning  management barely around popped in a few times barely available very dismissive and non nonchalant when it comes to issues. Not welcoming at all. When they finally hired a supervisor they hired someone who had no idea what they were doing which hindered you rather than helped you! You're basically on a sinking ship..  Communication is non existent management never helped directly with any guest issues, everything had to be handled by ourselves and when it went wrong everything fell on you. So much stress for no reason but the workers here were wonderful they were the reason I stayed for as long as I did.Absolutely no room for advancement from my short time here they will look outside before they promote internally especially at the front desk. I've seen it happen multiple times. The only thing I miss about this place is the people I worked with. If you do chose to apply here make it a stepping stone or a part time job. This place it wasn't horrible the pay was nice but I'm happy I left."
Sage Hospitality,1bet4ulol0mco0h2,2.0,"Renaissance Hotel in downtown Pittsburgh. Guests were always fantastic; however the managers were all good friends and literally acted like a clique of high school girls. Even when going above and beyond expectations, they would nit pick just to start their own drama. Awful. Not to mention employees regularly got sick eating the food that was provided as well as a few guests in the restaurant on property."

My favorite part of any job I have had is meeting new people and as this is a hotel environment, I have been lucky to meet people from all over the world."

Sage Hospitality,1acskbkbias1hfa8,4.0,Good Company to work for in most departments. Co workers and management need to work better together in some departments and other departments work very well together. The hardest part of the job was the hours and working Holidays and some weekends. The enjoyable part of the job was working with the managers and customers to make sure things got completed.
Sage Hospitality,1a9vkadd3as3ob0o,4.0,A typical day at work involves attending to multiple guest needs. Day to day operations vary. Signing off on payroll and maintaining multiple budgets within the front office departments.

Sage Hospitality,1a4hjl3cbak91fl4,2.0,"If you are looking into this company for maid services or food services I would not suggest this company. Their pay rate is horrible compared to the hours you will have to work, after working there for several months they switched me from full-time to part time with the excuse of ""I was not able to work enough hours"" (because of medical reasons) so I was unable to get paid vacation time or paid holidays even-though I had acquired a lot of time for both of those before being transferred. They switch management quite frequently with hardly any warning, and they have a high turnover rate. In my 11 months working here over 10 people quit and 3-5 people were fired for unreasonable means."
Sage Hospitality,1a3k7r77lb82aeo2,1.0,They talk a good game but this company sucks! They’re always hiring because nobody wants to work there. They treat all there employees like garbage and they will lay you off in a second with little or no warning

Sage Hospitality,19rav2u1dak70bk9,1.0,Business model is to be deliberately understaffed. The GM & Director of Operations will want 6/12's of hands on task related work if the position is salary. They will use you and lose you.

Usually have about 10-20 rooms a day depending on business. I have learned a lot my time here, how to clean properly and making sure there is no hair in bathrooms. I've learned that most guest that come back repeatedly, how they like their rooms cleaned and what kind of extras the will need. You can learn a lot just by how the person is and how long they plan to stay! The management is awesome, they are always there if I need help or if I can't help the customer myself then they are always their for back up. The hardest part is that its physically hard because there's a lot of moving, bending, lifting etc.. but mentally its easy remembering what goes in the rooms everyday. The enjoyable part of the job is the wonderful people you work with. I love everyone of my co workers and we truly are the meaning behind team work."

Basically anyone is employed here (experience or not). Managers don't care about you, and tend to involve your personal life into work. Managers didn't let you know what benefits you had, what the values of Sage were, so I basically had no knowledge of the company I was working for. Sage might be good in the Colorado area, but in the Indy area, they are horrible and don't know what they are doing. HORRIBLE company to work for."
Sage Hospitality,192nfpjp8b80gdn9,1.0,"Horribly understaffed with a high turnover. They know very well they expect too much from their administrative on up associates with insufficient pay. I was hired as an HR Coordinator with the responsibilities of a Director, but with the pay of a Clerk. The GM very well knew I was non-exempt, however she'd still slam me with emails and requests she expected me to get done while off the clock as if I were exempt salaried. GM of the property was two faced and will suck up to corporate in order to save herself from the shady things she does. When voicing my concerns to corporate, they didn't take me seriously therefore there was no change. This job caused me a great deal of mental stress that led to nights of no sleep. Even associates would mention out of concern I looked tired and beat down. I had no choice but to leave right before I had a mental breakdown from everything being piled on me without enough resources.  Do NOT work for Sage."

They started working me before they had even officially hired me (in the new hiring system, so that I could get paid). I started working on the Friday they got paid, so I had to wait 2 weeks to get paid, which was fine, BUT it took them 5 days AFTER I was supposed to get paid before I finally got my check, because they hadn't officially hired me in the system until THE DAY BEFORE the day I was supposed to get paid!!! I went in on pay day, and from then until I finally got my check they kept telling me ""It will be here tomorrow"", so I would call the next day and the next day and so on, and they kept telling me this... I will never work with that company again, and I don't advise it to anyone else!!"

Sage Hospitality,17grfb3gmadsge5g,4.0,"A typical day at work consists of diiferent day to day duties that help run the hotel. Everyday is different, some slower than others. I've learned a lot working for Sage Hospiatlity LLC but I mostly learned what type of upper managment traits I want to take from my managers. I would say learning to communicate with my managers has been a hardship for me but has also taught me how to see other perpectives. The most enjoyble part of my job is the people I met. They are only in my life for a brief period of time but the impression left is so big. Not only do I make a difference for them but at times they make a difference in mine as well."
Sage Hospitality,1730jpbvg4dsg89e,4.0,"I worked for Sage Hospitality for over six years. They gave me the opportunity to learn any area of hospitality I showed interest in. The General Manager and the rest of the Executive team all supported me in my professional growth and allowed me to go from Front Desk to Front Desk Supervisor to HR Coordinator and Payroll support. I was able to continue my career in HR because of the experience I got while working at a Sage property. Sage is the best employer I have ever had and not because of the career opportunity alone. I had real connections with the people I worked with. I felt like I was with my second family when I was at work and that made me want to get up in the morning. The hospitality industry as a whole is not the highest paying industry, but Sage maintains a competitive benefits plan and wage structure. I have never believed in a companies culture as much as I believe in theirs. This is a wonderful place to work."

University of Colorado,1e5vl3groouja800,4.0,It is a very laid back work environment. I would show up and just text someone on the team what they wanted me to do and I would do it. I was taught the skill required of me if I did not know how to do it originally. It is run by the government so the bureaucracy makes some things incredibly slow and annoying. The productivity of the workers was mediocre. I liked the guys I worked with and appreciate the time I had to work there.

University of Colorado,1e3r4fnbuo21v803,2.0,I quite honestly left CU because of my time as an RA. The university couldn't give a spit about you and asking for help from higher ups gets you nowhere. Stay away unless you absolutely have to do this to get the housing.

University of Colorado,1e10ech2hobeq801,3.0,"CU was alright though my PI was a jerk. She insisted I do my PHD in her lab, when I finally told her I didn’t want to she said that I wasn’t “intellectual” enough to pursue a PhD and that there was no point continuing my employment in her lab. I also experienced a bit of racism. People would legitimately call me racist names. CU is nice but the culture is not very inclusive.

Many of my coworkers went to CU and loved it so much they became employees. That being said, I have very little to complain about.  I ultimately left because I was very frustrated by my role.  I didn't feel like it was a good fit for me and my goals. During the interview phase, I was certain that I would be in love with the role as my previous job encompassed some of the same duties.  Sometimes you just don't until you try a new role on. Leadership was very supportive of me throughout my time with CU and they were very gracious when I resigned.

Some days are slow, but for the most part it gets busy. Like really busy... some employees work hard, some not so much.... and you have like 3 different managers (if you’re working kitchen anyway) I mostly worked dishes. Which I didn’t mind.

University of Colorado,1dlj355qbb80h802,3.0,"The culture makes it incredibly hard.  If you do not fit in with your team, you will not make it far at all.  The seniority which exists doesn't allow for the opportunity to enhance policies and procedures, as there is a resistance to change.  People are in roles and positions which they do not have the qualifications or knowledge base to accomplish.  The departments are completely siloed through each campus, and each school, and so on, with no consistency required."

University of Colorado,1dk1jj3lab85o800,4.0,"The University of Colorado Anshutz is a top-notch academic university located in Aurora, CO.

Pay could be better, especially now that minimum wage gap is shrinking, but it's also equal to other places for similar work so all things considered not bad. Great benefits if offered with position. Low stress, good work/life balance and plenty of time off are true positives. If you looking for something less than full time, knock yourself out finding something better than this opportunity. Only con is some later shifts may be required, but typically offer a shift premium also."

University of Colorado,1di3hlrmgh3js802,1.0,"I have worked for the University for about a year now and all the promises they told me to begin with are complete lies.

Division very unorganized as a whole."
University of Colorado,1dhbsfouih420802,3.0,"Very hard to get into unless alumni, some departments have little/no room for advancement and are very difficult to break out of. HR department is currently in chaos and has been very irratical for 10 years. Workflow is feast or famine. Unusual management mix in my area. My job is very technical, it took 2 years to learn it. The most enjoyable part is the "" programming "". Workplace culture is pretty good. Love working in higher education."
University of Colorado,1dgvoh63jh3tb800,3.0,"It is never a dull moment working in a methadone clinic. Job is challenging, stressful and fulfilling.  The training is great, you are trained to be a first class therapist. The hardest part of the job is the changes with forms and case load."

University of Colorado,1dgmabk5gh3p4800,4.0,"However, my questions were always answered, exceptions made when needed, and support always there.  It was a pretty straightforward position interviewing youth and caregivers for a youth violence prevention research study.  We got bonuses for every 5 interviews conducted, competitive bonuses for the most interviews in a week, etc.  Then when it got hard to convince people to participate, we were able to pay them more and were paid more ourselves."
University of Colorado,1dg639mfu24et007,1.0,"Absolutely HORRIBLE employer to work for!!! They treat their employees with the utmost disrespect and lack of feeling. The ""supervisor"" was an 18 year old girl who was in charge of personal training who would spend her time taking about her personal life and how drunk she got the night before then taking responsibility for her position. The pay is TERRIBLE. As a HIGHLY qualified personal trainer I only was paid slightly higher than minimum wage. There are NO raises or opportunities for advancement."

University of Colorado,1dfgnesbl24fh000,3.0,"The quality of the work-life at CU is highly variable depending on who you work for; much of the medical school is known for exploiting their hard-working PRA workers, Post-Docs, and grad students, but there are some groups who treat their employees well and perform excellent quality research and education services."
University of Colorado,1df1man55h3hs800,3.0,"UCCS is a great regional employer and the staff and faculty really care about the students. There is a lot of decentralization, which in some ways can be beneficial but in a lot of ways, is causing a lot of frustration, confusion, and unnecessary walls to be put up. Administration seems really far removed from staff; faculty demonstrate they feel superior to staff, and there is a constant battle for resources; time and money. Many positions are underpaid/undervalued (which is partly an issue with the very limited resources coming from the state), and this is causing substantial turnover."

I've learned more about the material by relearning what I've learned the first go around. My professor was of great support and provided ample guidance. The hardest part was balancing work outside of school, a full-course load, and having 10 hours of LA hours per week. Being able to help a student is invaluable and supersedes any stresses I had in terms of time commitments."
University of Colorado,1dd4hkkokh46q805,5.0,"Work consists of helping patrons with ticketing and seating in the various shows that all perform at the ENT Center for the Arts. Involves some work with a fairly complex computer system, but otherwise a very simple job."

University of Colorado,1dbtcvrmf24gs000,1.0,I would highly recommend that you not work here unless there are no other options available to you. Its a highly dysfunctional place to work with a total lack of leadership.
University of Colorado,1dbj3ek330kbo000,4.0,Great work/life balance but hard to move up due to very limited opportunity. Take advantage of the benefits to balance out for the job being lower paying than similar positions.

University of Colorado,1db8pmgu524eh000,4.0,I had a good experience working for the university. I had a part time job working with the university while I was a student. I would say it's a great position to be in for any student as it is convenient to take classes on the same campus that you work on.

University of Colorado,1da0cr0v9h3t4800,2.0,"The University provides good benefits including a great contribution to their 403b retirement plan but the pay leaves a lot to be desired. Getting hired can be challenging as they seem to most often hire from within or hire people based on who they know (like their neighbors children). I worked in a laboratory that was completely toxic and a huge liability to the university in many ways. CU was either unaware of the atrocities occurring there or was simply turning a blind eye to them. Getting hired, at least where I was, was either being in the right place at the right time, or simply knowing the right person who could get your foot in the door. Promotion/merit raises were basically non existent, unless you knew someone or sucked up to the right person. It was absolutely NOT based on the amount of quality hard work and dedication you showed. CU has potential to be a great place to work but be careful and choosy about where you accept employment within the organization. There are many wolves in sheep's clothing hiding within, who are more than happy to use you up completely."

The work was fairly routine, not having a great deal of change but always challenging. My supervisor and Director were great process managers but very poor people managers. ""Policy"" rules were applied differently by employee and not with any consistent standard. Performance expectations were also different based on who was liked and not liked. There was always a significant level of stress as to being ""watched"" and monitored to the microscopic level. This was a sentiment shared by many, not just me."

Benefits are amazing, PTO, health insurance, etc. Compensation is in the lower tiers unless you are faculty. Job security is quite good, but opportunity for advancement within the same department is low and would require relocation to an alternative department. No job culture existent at all. Work place respects 8 hours per day 5 days a week, in most areas.  As with most large employers, politics is prevalent. It is not about you or your contribution to the team effort, its about how you can make your boss look good to their bosses. Humility and ownership are rarely displayed, especially when dealing with faculty."

It is great if you have a family because of the flexibility. The only downfall is that if you are not faculty there is not much growth. There is movement but it is typically lateral."

University of Colorado,1c67v7kspakei9fr,2.0,"It depends on the department as there are dozens of places to work on campus, but of three places I've worked, all have had terrible leadership with Administrators who micromanage and do not understand how research is run, or the amount of time it takes to effectively and efficiently do a job so that things run smoothly.  Those who suck up to the right people are able to move up quickly and make obscene salaries, getting paid to be mediocre at best, incompetent at worst.  Many leaders on the campus are held to zero accountability and leave the lower level administrative staff to clean up their messes."

University of Colorado,1c4fv0d0paqhkbl3,3.0,"University of Colorado likes to think of itself as a competitor with the big universities in the country but is still a country university.  Most of its accolades come from the fact that it has little to no competition.  It is difficult to see the University of Colorado becoming ""world class"", as it likes to see itself, when it continues to train and rehire its own people after sending them elsewhere for their specialty degree.   If CU wants to be better, it needs to diversify, hire experts from world class universities and MAINTAIN THEM.   Turnover for outside experts is too high."

Sadly when the project hit a bump it all got put on me, I was forced to work overtime, often left on my own flailing, and after a short amount of time, and a lot of efforts, I was still terminated suddenly.

University of Colorado,1c04q3lrcbrcvd86,4.0,"While working at the University I encountered a multitude of wonderful cooworkers, but management and other supervisory positions created real barriers to innovation because of ego and preference. Digital record keeping, automation of large scale distributions, digital marketing and social media are current good practices in today's office environment but were not preferred practices on the Anschutz Medical Campus. Very happy to innovate elsewhere!"
University of Colorado,1c047rl1makd7e2p,3.0,"There are some places that have a great work place environment and others are horrendous. Be careful when selecting a lab.

University of Colorado,1btmj5o965nb9drt,5.0,"The Family Development Center at UCCS was a wonderful experience as a pre-school teacher and a parent of a kindergarten student.  The facility was clean, asthetically pleasing, safe, and child oriented.  The equipment was well cared for and kept clean for the children.  The teachers were dedicated, educated, creative, and child oriented. The administrators, were hands on, enthusiatic, and always available to parents as well as teachers, and children.  Being a certified behavior specialist, and  first  grade teacher for many years,  I was given the freedom to develop a creative, interactive educational curriculum based on the needs of my nine 3-5 year olds in the part-day program.  I only wish that I could be with the children five days a week instead of two.  We had so much fun!  This experience led me to completing an early childhood internship at Pikes Peak College in 2004.

University of Colorado,1bslmrqubakeqa72,4.0,"I worked at the College of Nursing on the Anschutz Campus which is a nice campus. Unfortunately, a lot of attention is given to the medical school because they have the biggest population on the campus, so not as much attention is given to the other schools. Since this is the case, and the majority rules, many funds are geared towards research for the medical school and not the College of Nursing. I did like working there until the end partly because of the political atmosphere and it was getting to be where if one person complained about anything, everyone had to go out of their way to accommodate. It is impossible to make everyone happy all of the time. Staff seemed a little underappreciated by management. The focus was more on hiring the best faculty which is understandable to attract students. However due to the creation of new programs, sometimes staff support was not in the loop, causing issues that were preventable if there had been better communication. Despite these issues that occurred, I did enjoy working at the college specifically with faculty and staff."

The research work environment is very relaxed and laid back.  However, many positions are grant funded.  This doesn't allow for security in regards to long term employment.

University of Colorado,1b9u46uhtakdedpi,1.0,"I found my particular position enthralling and valuable work. However, the supervisor and physician I worked with were abrasive, inconsiderate, and unwilling to instruct me with useful information. I was constantly being told to accomplish more than was possible and denied the necessary tools to complete tasks. Ethical considerations I felt were necessary were repeatedly ignored delaying progress or requiring me to complete tasks I was not comfortable with. I was given no opportunity for advancement, but asked to complete supervisor and leadership roles without compensation. Ultimately a lack of defined procedures for using employee benefits and a hostile work environment lead to a loss of will to work in an at will position. Do not take a position with this employer without clearly defined expectations and an ability to refuse additional requirements repeatedly in the work place."

University of Colorado,1806hhp6bae0gbpu,4.0,"I meet with fauculty on a regular basis to identify patients who have the giving capacity to give over 25k and up. They work with me on identifying patients who have expressed intrest in knowing about their research. I find ways to reach out to the patients through cold calls, direct mail or email and try to secure face to face meetings. At that point I work hard to cultivate those potential prospects by taking them to lunch, providing them with materials, tours, etc. Once that relationship has been established it is appropriate to talk about fundraising and money with the prospect. My faculty and I strategize the appropriate dollar amount to ask the patient and come up with a proposal that makes sense and meets the patients needs. Once the patient decides to make a gift it is up to me to continiue to steward the donor and make sure they are updated on what their money is being used for.  I really enjoy working face to face with patients and getting to know why they are grateful patients and what drives them to support their doctors research. The hardest part of my job is identifying the right donor. You could make 15 cold calls and finally get a face to face meeitng with one, but it is still not guarenteed that they are interested in supporting medical research."

Throughout the week I would creat lesson plans, meet with students for office hours, attend weekly TA meetings, and grade students' papers and other homework. I learned how to creat a lesson plan that was not only effective, but was interactive for my students. I also learned my own teaching strategies. The management and my other co-workers had a passion for teaching and we worked well together. The hardest part of the job was trying to balance being a full time graduate student and grading papers at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my students and watch them grow throughout the semester."

I was a salaried employee expected to be on call 24/7, to come in at all hours, to perform tasks way above my skill level with little to no recognition and absolutely no overtime. My direct supervisor repeatedly took credit for projects and ideas that I initially had, only to continually be verbally abused by that same person and eventually fired. I went in with a higher educational background then the majority of people in my department (Masters level education from a top tier school) whereas the majority of those in my department held B.A.'s from online universities and had never actually attended a brick and mortar institution.

Mental Health Partners,1ej8g1uklsqbl800,1.0,"There are many reasons why there is a high turnover rate here. The work environment was not safe, police were constantly called, lack of support from managers, and it was extremely difficult to schedule medical apts and use sick time. My work team was unsupportive. A coworker of mine told my team that someone must have hit me on my head or that I might have had a disability because “i was slow”. This was not true but extremely disappointing if these are the same staff that are interfacing with clients."
Mental Health Partners,1ej6nufq2sqbl800,1.0,"NOT a place to work if you yourself are mentally ill. They put up a false atmosphere of acceptance and “go-with-the-flow” management when the reality is more along the lines of hypocrisy and an extremely unclear vision of the future of the organization. Not to mention the amount of turnover in the past few years, the new management is no better than the old. The homeless and addict population that they claim to help and support are spoken about as “others,” “us versus them.” They treat workers as a means to an end and the hardest working, most public/client facing positions are paid and respected the least. Would not recommend, especially to people that actually care about the mentally ill and the mental health field"

Mental Health Partners,1di09ovnkbrfh800,2.0,"MHP has a records system that is very, very difficult to use.  MHP staff that attempts to keep this system productive is unable to keep major issues from arising regularly that impact the inputting of records and the validity of client charts. Report functions intended to help find missing or expired paperwork do not work. There are reminders to renew paperwork that does not yet need to be renewed. Major assessment tools break and cannot be used for months. Then when the tool is back online it is expected that as a clinician, you will get all of these documents up to date for all of your clients' charts. Often several of these will have to be done to simply transfer a person to another program in the organization. Those receiving these clients often get quite nasty about these ""missing"" documents.  Caseloads are large, no-shows are frequent and expectations for utilization are unrealistic. There is a constant threat that the agency will not be paid for our work if we don't do this or that in a rush fashion. This sometimes includes making up answers for client assessments in order to meet state filing requirements for Medicaid which might be an ethical issue for some. Management seems oblivious of these issues and ""middle management"" or staff in charge of serving clinicians tend to paint rosy pictures for their bosses..Working with the clients is wonderful and many are in great need. Many clients respond dramatically to interventions. It is the only reason I stay."

MHP seems to think they're the only under-funded, short-staffed nonprofit working in behavioral health. It's 2018, people. Get it together. You can be the underdog and still succeed. Leadership is drowning in problems they can't solve, managers have no resources to help their staff and they're usually lacking in leadership skills, directors are clueless when it comes to day-to-day operations and staff are exhausted. Clients are perfectly aware of the burn out and don't feel valued. Positive experiences at MHP are few and far between. Do not work here. Wait for new leadership to come around."

Most studies show that high employee turnover has to do with management and workplace culture. Somehow MHP is not aware of this basic phenomenon of workplace dysfunction. I would not recommend anyone to work here."
Mental Health Partners,1c3hm6rchb898enr,1.0,This place would like to present itself as come kind of innovative clinic center in Boulder.
Mental Health Partners,1burfu5q71ai27lj,5.0,nice people very happy environment. come in and start on computer help some poeple on computer. very helpful. loving poeple in work going to lunch. talking to poeple about there problems
Mental Health Partners,1br0lsjsq52tu9lf,4.0,"Mental Health Partners does a world of wonder, or at least it tries too, within the Boulder County community."
Mental Health Partners,1bq6ebvr1ak5r8pq,1.0,not worth the effort to write out all that is troubling about this agency. AVOID if you possibly can. too low of pay for work. No clear leadership. horrible benefits
Mental Health Partners,1bgtsjcj6as1mfk9,4.0,"MHP gives a lot of training and continued education and room for growth. They care about you as a person, not just you in your functional role. It's a team-building environment."
Mental Health Partners,1eegb6k6oqb7c800,3.0,"Immediate supervisor and co-workers were very supportive, team atmosphere and great place to work! Poor management & leadership, especially at the Board of Directors/CEO level. Upper management very slow to bring about changes and more focused on hiring more managers to lessen their workload rather than hiring much needed therapists and care coordinators."
Mental Health Partners,1b8ali4gvaqh7bo4,5.0,MHP is a wonderful organization with a dedicated and very intelligent staff.  They are committed to providing the best possible service to each client and working hard to contribute to the community it serves.
Mental Health Partners,1b87v5s55aqh58iq,1.0,"MHP does an excellent job in hiring excellent and qualified candidates (if not over qualified). However, MHP could work better in supporting employees and retaining individuals. The turn over rate is very high. The ""revolving door"" aspect of employee turnover rate is not supportive to clients who need services and not supportive of the budget and work environment."
Mental Health Partners,1b1n5bvs5as1qav8,3.0,"Overall, I did enjoy the different positions I have had with MHP. I was on good teams with mostly supportive direct supervisors. Not everyone was supportive, and many teams and locations had problems."
Mental Health Partners,1ape7236kaqi4e0u,1.0,I wouldn't recommend working here long term. Too much turmoil and understaffed.  Skip this place and look elsewhere.  Very Liberal environment creates folks that get sidetracked and can't focus on the critical issues. Cutting costs is more important to executive staff.
Mental Health Partners,1ak7eh6fvas1u8g3,1.0,"The very high caseload,  the lack of communication from management, concerns constantly being  ignored, and the pressure to manage many cases has lead to an unsatisfactory feeling of ""burnt out""  (I am happy my internship is over) . In my short time, I  observed staff members frequently quitting."
Mental Health Partners,1ajtjlnpoak62aka,1.0,"Management and MHP executives have noted the higher than average turnover rate and the turnover rate has been expressed in meetings. This is not the employer of choice.  This is not a healthy work environment--high case loads, stringent policies, and a culture where communication is not encouraged amongst staff. Clear signs of little or no training amongst some management team staff."
Mental Health Partners,1aj0bq7alakb68n7,1.0,"I agree with other reviews saying there is an ""Elitism"" attitude with upper management. It started in 2013 when the Chief Strategy Officer came on board. He was a very poor selection for a position that is not even needed. He unfairly eliminated very talented technical people that were leading MHP in the right direction. MHP has been wavering ever since with no technical leadership."
Mental Health Partners,1aim0jamj1bgf28f,1.0,"Do not work here.  You will regret it.  It used to be a great place to work but has steadily gone downhill since the hiring of a clinical psychiatrist into the Chief Strategy Officer role in 2013.  Management is out of touch and there is a culture of elitism and secrecy.  Technical decisions are made by non-technical people and large scale projects frequently fail.  The organization is top heavy and needs a haircut and a shake up to oust the entrenched.  They claim to want to be the ""employer of choice"" for Boulder County.  Laughable comedy.  Save yourself headaches and heartaches.  Skip over this company and aim higher."
Mental Health Partners,1ag11h9pnb82lb26,1.0,Not surprising this place has bad reviews.
Mental Health Partners,1afm2k25uakama46,1.0,"Top Heavy Management concerned more with their job titles (VP's and Directors) than providing a constructive work environment for their employees interfacing directly with clients. Management has created a segregated 'elite' group. One recent example is they renamed the Sr, Systems Administrator (IT position) to Director of IT because they could not find anyone to accept the Sr. Systems Administrator position. Non-technical management can not make decisions. Don't waste your time here if you want a long, fulfilling career."
Mental Health Partners,1aev0ok2iaka89c9,3.0,"Caseloads were through the roof, clinicians were constantly quitting due to burn out, management ignored our concerns and basically told us we weren't working efficiently enough.  People (like me) were referred to (by our CEO) as a ""negative Nellys"" for bringing up legitimate concerns about the ethics of what we were being asked to do."
Mental Health Partners,1a49qgk01as0odh4,1.0,The lack of experience of the CSO hurts MHP. The CSO has never had any major accomplishments. Good talker but lacks experience.
Mental Health Partners,19umkc4ah5na7c9i,2.0,Two stars.  Able to utilize skills.  Passion for client quality of life and recovery mid level staff and down.  Upper management lack of client focus.
Mental Health Partners,19u2j7o2mb82je4n,1.0,"Management heavy, clients come second, HR is there for the upper managers only in personnel issues."
Mental Health Partners,19th6i8lmb824fpf,4.0,"The work day included charting, meeting with multiple clients for hour long sessions, organizing for groups and or helping in the milieu."
Mental Health Partners,19no3s59j1d036ec,1.0,"Good place to work if you like to help people but get paid very little. Everyone seems to be over worked, under paid and highly stressed.. High turn over, poor direction from CSO focused only on money. It would be nice to hire some experienced business people instead of psychologists... the executive team has been in place too long so there are no new ideas, very stagnant."
Mental Health Partners,19en3kt5dak8g9d4,1.0,"The AOP Program in Longmont is chaotic and unorganized. The manager and supervisor have no sense of humor and are heady and unfeeling. They cannot find anyone to fill the substance abuse counselor there, so asked me to do a month's documentation backed up because the other people before me were ""mishaps"". Mental Health Partners (MHP) is not interested in hiring people who have warmth and good clinical skills. It's about overkill in paper work for job security. There is a lot of judgmental people in the management structure too. For example, at the last new employee orientation, we were watching a video on cross-cultural sensitivities. A man addressed that it is going to be tricky for him because he is going to work with law enforcement, which may be a culture of punishment, while he comes from a more treatment point of view. I have over 15 years working with offenders in community corrections. I stated that I too had some struggles when dealing with the criminal culture, as well as a culture of punishment in the half-way house program where I worked. When I expressed that, I was shot down by the presenter, an unfriendly aggressive woman who judged me and my opinion and experience. I dare say she never worked with manipulative criminals or sociopaths. MHP is a culture of stoic unfeeling aggressive women. I was let go after a week because I struggled to learn the hundreds of guidelines to make even a simple note in a timely manner. I passed the Spanish proficiency test, but they are not committed to reaching out to monolingual Spanish-speaking consumers. Bilingual clinicians are"
Mental Health Partners,19ehakpalas0g8qb,4.0,I worked for this company for about 15 months and loved being here.  The management is wonderful and really aid in your professional growth.  The weekly supervision meetings help with your growth as a professional with honest feedback and wonderful support for what you are doing well.  The company encourages a balance between professional and personal life as well as encourages you to enjoy what you are doing with your professional life.
Mental Health Partners,19dlo6gkqb84gfdq,2.0,"I wouldn't recommend anyone who is good technically and looking for a long term IT career work here. It would be too frustrating. The management is inexperienced, non-technical and has no long term planning or prioritization skills. Both deadlines and workloads are unrealistic since they are driven by nontechnical Psychologists."
Mental Health Partners,196nir9dn5n8gf8i,2.0,"Interesting work but very stressful. Lower pay, constant threats of budget cuts; don't feel appreciated or valuable as an employee. hate to see other folks laid off"
Mental Health Partners,1eegb6k6oqb7c800,3.0,"Immediate supervisor and co-workers were very supportive, team atmosphere and great place to work! Poor management & leadership, especially at the Board of Directors/CEO level. Upper management very slow to bring about changes and more focused on hiring more managers to lessen their workload rather than hiring much needed therapists and care coordinators."
Mental Health Partners,1951h8f5jak8ge8j,3.0,"This was a demanding job requiring a lot of paperwork. I enjoyed working with clients at the front lines of their recovery from mental illness, however, found the agency as a whole was bogged down with too many clients and not enough clinicians, making the workload heavier on all parties."
Mental Health Partners,1931kjdfsak8geam,5.0,"I am happy to work at Mental Health Partners. My supervisor is incredibly supportive, and my colleagues are kind and helpful. My work is meaningful, and I get to work independently and participate in various committees."
Mental Health Partners,192rhi6g4b84g80f,2.0,"After 6 years of hard work in difficult work environment I lost my job due ""budget cuts"".  Working directly in an inpatient environment certainly had its moments as well as very fullfilling knowing you are helping those with extreme mental illnesses."
Mental Health Partners,191lsq9c8b84geai,1.0,"Seems like the emphasis here is not on ""Mental Health"" but more on cost cutting and reduction of staff and/or hours. The hardest part of the job is remaining focused when all the people around you are overworked and stressed. Senior Management is pretty incompetent (not skilled in people management). In my opinion .. If you are an RN you are better off elsewhere"
Mental Health Partners,190cp2cqmb80g9le,1.0,"Fun place to work to help indigent clients. Upper management is focused on money more than employee loyalty. low pay, limited job security due to budget cuts - currently expanding but may cut back later due to budget constraints"
Mental Health Partners,18uv1qp6eak4g9ao,5.0,I enjoy working at Mental Health Partners. It is an excellent non-profit organization.  It offers help to a large population in healthcare.
Mental Health Partners,18fs9sq0e5ncgciv,4.0,The hardest part of my job is not being able to truy help some one face to face otherwise it is a good place to work.
Mental Health Partners,18f0lurt8ak4gcvu,3.0,I enjoy that this company takes care of mental health patients no matter what there ability to pay is.
Mental Health Partners,18bmgqhfrb84g876,1.0,"Mental Health Partners was a great place to work. Now,  however, the work environment has changed significantly since the layoff of the much loved Director of IT. A Clinical Psychologist acting as the Cheif Strategy Officer has decided to take over the IT department and micromanage it and therefore, eliminated the Director's position. This new guy is difficult to deal with because he expects too much, has no real management experience and has very little technical knowledge. Job security and future outlook do not look very good."
Mental Health Partners,18bkqdvg85n8gdjm,3.0,"A new Chief Strategy Officer (a clinical psychologist) came aboard in April and changed the work environment from cooperative to very hostile. No one seem to care for his management style. He has to take control and micro-manage employees which is very counterproductive to getting work done. This Strategy Officer is very unapproachable, non-technical and has obviously never managed before. Seems he has taken on more work than one human can successfully handle."
Mental Health Partners,189s61hkjak8gag1,5.0,"Currently working at MHP and enjoy working with other mental health professionals that are truly dedicated to their jobs, and the welfare of our clients.  Working with families and individuals to improve their life circumstances is very rewarding.  Helping the clients/families in the same communities that we live in, is empowering for both our clients and staff.  Love my job!  Wonderful team and management support.  Good hours and benefits!"
Mental Health Partners,17be4u83f5dog88j,5.0,"I worked with students at both Erie Colorado Middle and High School. I was providing support and confidential counseling for the students as part of Mental Health Partnership, a third party agency and thus exempt from the policies that the school counselors had of sharing all information that students shared with the rest of the school system. I was required to keep notes on all interactions with students and fill out ongoing progress notes as well as confer with a Mental Health Partnership supervisor on all of the students that saw me."
Mental Health Partners,16v48ioubadsgcr0,4.0,It was a positive experience for the most part. The people are nice and supportive.
Agilent Technologies,1f4j41v86u392800,5.0,As a contractor at Agilent I had a wonderful time getting to know the employees and management. everyone was extremely friendly and the idea of safety was always a priority.
Agilent Technologies,1f6ns32id3obs000,1.0,"Agilent provides an okay workplace - most of the good was due to the people at the same level I worked with. However, there is no real vertical communication, and you get the feeling that the company has no plans, no vision for its future. Compensation is average for the industry, but don't expect a raise or a chance at a promotion."
Agilent Technologies,1f6j6jj7vu1ap800,4.0,Overall i believe the company is great and they have phenomenal instruments and service. However there is a rather large divide between the service industry and the rest of the company. They have picnics and parties occasionally while the service people are working like crazy to just keep up with the workload and half of us don't even know who other people in the district are. There is not enough people to support the amount of work for the territories.
Agilent Technologies,1f6chldn0t4eg800,5.0,"I have only worked contract work for them and found them very reasonable and accommodating. I highly recommend working for them on a contract basis. You are treated as if you are an outsider by management, but then you are. They are accomodating if you have any personal emergency."
Agilent Technologies,1f5guk466u2n1800,3.0,"This place is very laid back I will give them that.  But it's too much favoritism being shown in this warehouse.  They also will hold you back from other positions in the warehouse, if they feel that they need you in that position you currently have.  They employees are messy and the supervisors are messy at times."
Agilent Technologies,1f3jhe3e2ocr1800,5.0,"Good vacations and benefits, solid company, decent upper management, generally good employees to work with."
Agilent Technologies,1f1h6gesmnph7800,5.0,"Packing  product  ,, In the morning before work starts , everybody stretches for safety , then everybody gets there work assignments and goes to work stations .."
Agilent Technologies,1evv2hfgju1sg800,5.0,Agilent's focus on workplace culture and teamwork makes it a fun place to work. They are about self accountability and try to help employees do their best. They provide opportunities for employees to showcase their talents and abilities. The work being done here has an impact all over the world and that makes every effort worthwhile.
Agilent Technologies,1esur4jj3u1n1800,4.0,"I enjoy my job and plan to stay for the time being. I love my team and feel valued by my direct manager but cannot say the way of “corporate” as pay is sub-average and there is little room for advancement. The flexibility, time off and other benefits make up for it for the most part. The work can be challenging at times but overtime is rarely expected and the job is low stress overall."
Agilent Technologies,1esget2ch3ois000,2.0,Did not feel like I served a purpose. Management will not let you know the information that you need to succeed in the company. I felt that there is no room for advancement and my manager was ready to leave if she didn't get her way.
Agilent Technologies,1en49vcv1o1no800,3.0,"I liked my coworkers, liked what I did, stayed busy, didn't like the mean managers. Not a great place to work, but not lousy either. I liked the manager who hired me, but he was replaced after about six months. From there, I didn't know where I stood day to day, always felt I was going to be fired the next week, and kept looking for jobs. Eventually I found one and left."
Agilent Technologies,1em1bl3o5u1nm800,4.0,Overall great company with solid executive leadership.  Strong culture and generally good people in the company.  Mature company top in its field particularly having been spun-off from good old HP.
Agilent Technologies,1ej0hogi5sqbl800,5.0,"Loved being a remote employee.  Company Car.  Great pay and benefits.  Most management are really good, but the last one was what pushed me out of the company.  Even though I almost always worked alone at customer sites, there was a real since of being part of a team.  Loads of resources, from product literature to factory support personal.  Can't say enough good things about the company or coworkers."
Agilent Technologies,1eirg45a0sqbl800,5.0,"I recently graduated and joined Agilent’s Sales team. They are welcoming, work with new hire to ensure learning curve is met, and generally care about you. The work/life balance is awesome. Only complaint is occasional management mishaps with rolling out new initiatives. Some things clearly aren’t thought through entirely. However, in comparison to other companies, this is minimal."

Agilent Technologies,1ebmpso53p1n2800,4.0,"The site was a small group with 20+ employees, with a culture of a family style. The employees were relatively close to each other, and treated fairly. The salary was good as well."

Agilent Technologies,1e7h7ikjooa6h800,4.0,"A great place to work, except for when the management doesn't have a clue what to do. I was in the Bio-Science division. We were developing gene chips for all sorts of purposes. The management didn't have a clue. They were all gun ho on the hardware and software we were developing. A gene chip scanner was the furthest along. The management supported its development really well. I was in a group that was trying to automate the process of using the chips. That is take a new gene chip, inject a sample of DNA. Let the machine process the sample. After the process, the gene chip is inserted into a carousel (like a slide projector) that is removed from the machine and placed into the gene chip scanner above. They dumped the project because they could not get a software person to fix some lines of code. This was in the late 90's when software was hot, but we hired a guy and then he was taken away from us. The marketing guy had no interest in the project he barely spoke two words to us. They were shocked when three of us left the group. The lead engineer left for the Agilent lab and me and another guy left the company. Like I said, great company, but try to find out if the division knows what it wants to do."
Agilent Technologies,1e76t6rrr33md000,5.0,Great Company. Hired through Intellisource. Terrible company that hires and fires the wrong people: Wrongfully fired. Intellisource discriminates. I waa

Agilent Technologies,1e58p2f72hduk803,5.0,"I have achieved as much as I can here and now it is time to take on another avenue.  The company treated me well and I enjoyed the work, but I feel I have more to offer so I need to find a new challenge."

Agilent Technologies,1e4emek9io2l9801,1.0,"I was a contractor with CSA, Customer Service Associates, contractors are used where they need labor without a college degree. Agilent Employees have to be degreed. Agilent Employees are treated well. Part of contractor indoctrination is what benefits are for Agilent employees and not for contractors. Contractors are second class employees."
Agilent Technologies,1e429s3q3ou9h802,5.0,Great place to work! The culture and management is absolutely the best I've ever encountered. Agilent values their employees and encourages training to promote growth.
Agilent Technologies,1e3oht5a4ngmr802,4.0,I really enjoy working for a company that values integrity and values. They are culturally inclusive and have great employees.  I appreciate being able to work from home sometimes & start early to avoid much of the morning commute traffic

Agilent Technologies,1e12uqbpcq4it803,1.0,"This is a very incoherent company with regards to the quality of their middle managers.Try to find as much as you can about your future manager(through Linkedin,Indeed,acquaintances etc).Onboarding procedure and training are non-existent.I have also seen many people being fired for ridiculous reasons without any examination of the case by the HR.The positives are the restaurant and lack of overtime."

Agilent Technologies,1dvv99ibtq3n1803,4.0,"This is a great company to work for, however one must be a self-starter in order to advance within one's own career. Depending on the department, opportunities may be easily accessible or difficult to come by."
Agilent Technologies,1dvnfcr6rolf2803,1.0,I wouldn't recommend to anybody who has a family unless u are going in as upper management...they make us come in early and never know what time we getting off..it is so poorly managed only because they show favoritism in the company. My experience with this company has been by the the worse in any warehouse job I've been employed
Agilent Technologies,1dumeve66hbpf803,3.0,Great company just needs more experienced supervision. Management is very nice and you stay busy the day goes by very fast overall if you want to advance there are opportunities.

Get used to being treated like a worthless piece of garbage if you work in the manufacturing department which is overseen by someone who plays on their phone all day long and who's boss is a bi-polar micro-manager that act like a toddler when she doesn't get her way. Benefits are marginal at best, turnover is at record levels, moral is terrible, and management couldn't do a worse job if they tried."

Agilent Technologies,1dh98nkc90kbg000,4.0,This was a good job. I enjoyed learning all the different products made and the technicians were very nice and knowledgeable. I didn't get the chance to enjoy being an actual Agilent employee as was working through a Temp Agency.

Agilent Technologies,1dh20u21lh459800,3.0,For a company with a tenth of the revenue of HP they have exactly the same administrative overhead of the original. This is pretty damning but I started my career at HP and Agilent is not what HP was and their management structure is very top heavy and heavy handed. The products are ok if you’re a monkey and need monkeys to run them. Some are leading edge but they live on their reputation.
Agilent Technologies,1dgt3icfjh44v800,1.0,"Management turnover very high (3 of 4 district sales managers gone in the last 18 months). Constant consumables talent bleed to the instrument side of the biz or new opts outside of Agilent. No new CSD products in years, no investments made in this division. Have fallen short of sales goals for years. Front line management (mostly gone) has or had sales experience. Mid and upper level sales management and most of product managers and marketing CSD personnel have never carried a bag. Agilent is first an instrument company always has been always will be. Aftermarket is an afterthought. Second, Agilent is a marketing company and the thing they market the best is themselves. Don't believe the hype and stay away from the kool-aid."

But once you are in hat all goes away.  The departments are ruthless towards each other.  Blame game and employee stealing is rampant throughout the company. I managed a repair center and was always fighting off other managers from trying to steal my talented employees.  HR is another entirely different animal.  They are on the extreme side of the employees and very anti-management.  If you ever approached them for advice on how to handle a non-productive worker, it suddenly became your fault and it was your butt on the line for not coaching them properly."

Agilent Technologies,1db0ukhio1d0j000,5.0,"Started out there as an equipment operator.   After two years of that they informed me that if I chose to go back to school in the tech field they would pay for it.   I was working 6am to 6pm so I signed up for school and they paid the tuition, parking fees, books, supplies, etc.  They also let me stay on the clock while attending school so I was paid to go as well.   Was able to complete my technician degree in two years and then I was advanced to the Maintenance Tech group working on High Vacuum pumps at first, the on to the main equipment used to manufacture integrated circuits.  After a total of 6 years, I was made redundant and received a package equaling 1 years pay.   Found a job in 4 months so banked the rest.

Electronic Test & Measurement instrumentation was the initial focus of the corporation and HP computers were originally developed explicitly to control their instruments in order to sequence through measurement steps and retrieve and analyze test data.  These computers were designed specifically for this purpose along with their custom CPUs and proprietary operating system HP BASIC, which was also the programming language.  Their printer business, similarly, was created to provide printed output capabilities to support reporting and graphing of test results - this started with pen plotter machines and ultimately produced laser-jet and finally ink-jet technologies.  All the computing and printing technologies were byproducts of the need to facilitate automated test and measurement systems."

Agilent Technologies,1818tdjs35n8gdsd,4.0,"Each day at work was like a surprise you never knew what you mightface . the work is very tedious and you must at all times remain focused, the slighted area could cost consumers and company large sums of money. Everyday with chemistry you learn something new. The co-workers where great and where always there to lead a hand. that was great ,we always somehow found ways to make each other laugh and smile boy did that make the day.Each day we where responsible for many task but the most difficult one for me was pouring a 40lb bottle of chemicals overhead in a glass dome, that was tough!"
Agilent Technologies,17uirqmp3ae0g80q,3.0,"I have seen a lot of changes as Agilent with regards to how the employees are treated, and none of the changes are good.  They are striving to be a mediocre company with mediocre pay, but they want top-notch engineers.  Good luck with that."
Agilent Technologies,17u5tgrovae0gb06,4.0,"As the outbound marketing manager in a complex fiber optics test & measurement division, I had to constantly seek approval for details from not only my direct boss but marketing personnel in NAMO - Agilent's North American Marketing Organization AND marketing personnel in the German office.  The German group was highly technical and responsible for product development.  The US group was the sales arm for the German division.  Relationships were not often good.  I was in a pivotal position, trying to augment US sales peoples' interface with clients in the US.  With NAMO help, we put a costly 16 wheel truck on the road in the US and it transported all the division's major products - for product demonstration across the country.  The building of the mobile unit was a laborious task, as was the coordination with sales managers in regions of the US to use the mobile unit for product demonstration.  The dot com bubble fueled the early success of the division, but management did NOT read the decline of the dot com frenzy.  Eventually the division was closed.  Very poor long-term projection skills and too much technical in-fighting within German/US division.  Not an easy place to work and be successful."

Agilent Technologies,16togoc7a4e0g9le,4.0,"Typical day the last year I was at Agilent (temporary position) was mainly assisting vendor managers / contractors, getting them set up from the very beginning to the very last of their requirements to work either at Agilent site of offsite. Management was okay, but didn't really want to listen closely, too busy I presume. Loved my team of co-workers and they loved me! Hardest part of the job was when there was software glitches and having to wait for resolution of the glitches. Most enjoyable part of my job was a completely successful project completed and the ""thank you"" that went with it."
Agilent Technologies,16qs42tm75dogfe7,5.0,I worked in Shipping for nine years. Was the RMA coordinator. Which is receiving products back from customers. Inspect them and give to engineer to inspect.

Agilent Technologies,16qccprg14e0gc8f,3.0,RF - IF equipment primarily. Learned quite a bit about metrology. Management has really got to get in touch with supporting workers needs to complete tasks. Lack of support from management is the hardest part of the job. Most enjoyable part of the job is personal satisfaction from solving complex electronic problems.
Agilent Technologies,16q56bf1n4e0geob,4.0,Science remains supreme at this instrument company. It was a pleasure to discuss plans and and to help determine the future possibilities. The best part of the job was the ability to set priorities of the daily workflow.

Plenty of appreciation for the help proferred."
Frasier Meadows,1eslt48k5u31u800,3.0,"I’ve read a lot of the reviews on indeed for Frasier, and I agree with every one of them. Frasier is a great place to work if you take out the management side. The residents are super sweet and understanding, coworkers are amazing and you’ll find some of the best people  in all departments. However, the management gives you little to no support. The upper team management is all too concerned with what the CEO wants/ will make him happy instead of the residents. The management side of Frasier is really disappointing especially after you meet the nicest elderly population ever."
Frasier Meadows,1emfvqfaru1ac800,2.0,"Typical work days were hectic and disorganized, this was mostly due to various aspects of upper management. They recently built a new facility in order to increase revenue. Paid time off is minimal, no floating holidays, no sick days but flu shots are mandatory. most federal holidays are not provided, no real retirement benefits, bargain-basement health insurance. The most enjoyable aspect of the job were the residents, who come from a multitude of backgrounds and tend to be very skilled and talented people."
Frasier Meadows,1ej668lobsqbl800,3.0,Good benefits almost immediately when hired. Management is decent and pay is fair. A slower paced community but always things to do keeping a steady work pace.
Frasier Meadows,1ef7ckkdvp1h1800,2.0,I really don’t want to get into it so I’ll just start by saying this. Keep scrolling and do not give this place your time and energy. Management is manipulative and will drive you mad.
Frasier Meadows,1dhn1scntb8am803,1.0,The environment is always one of change.  the CEO is an egotistical man who is not very smart.  He makes sure that only board members who will rubber-stamp whatever radical new idea he proposes are placed on the Board.  He only hires Upper Level Management that will support his radical agenda -- not ones who will actually stand up to bad ideas and hold him accountable.
Frasier Meadows,1d6qhdcks1agj000,3.0,"I enjoyed working for Frasier the residents where wonderful to care for. the staff was also nice to work with. It is a relaxed place to work, and quite a bit of over time if you are looking for additional hours."
Frasier Meadows,1cs4thbnsak7d800,4.0,I really enjoyed my PT position with my first supervisor.  She was very interested in my recommendations for improvement.  We actively worked on a process improvement project until she left.
Frasier Meadows,1co9m2aigakd7800,5.0,It's a good place to work with good management and the best part is the residents are soo much co operative and helpful. It is situated in the beautiful place which is safe.
Frasier Meadows,1cm3laiguakcg81q,3.0,Management is not to be trusted. Watch your back. Long term employees released and jobs eliminated without any notice. No loyalty. Wages are not commensurate with experience and lack of support for career development.
Frasier Meadows,1cg7glv9aas0kc9a,4.0,Caring work environment making it's way through changing times. This multi tiered facility strives at being the best it can be while paving the way for a new culture in new times.
Frasier Meadows,1cbqob6o0aqgk87f,5.0,"Awesome place to work! Definitely fast paced, as you would expect in a nursing home/skilled nursing setting but staff was wonderful and residents were sweet."
Frasier Meadows,1ca4l42d0akjvf9c,1.0,"Very disappointing place to work. The leadership/management team have no idea what they are doing and the place functions only because of over-worked, dedicated staff. The CEO and his ""leadership"" team are a joke. This place needs to be reorganized with a whole new management team. The residents are paying so much money to live here and they deserve better. Unethical decisions are being made regarding residents' care. Shame on the leadership team and Board of Directors for letting things get to this place and allowing it to continue dispite reports of employees reporting their concerns."
Frasier Meadows,1c9l1qtl6akfpebv,1.0,"Poor leadership.  No training or support.  Many staff have gone years without having adequate training or support from their supervisors.  Focus is on the new building but the residents and staff currently living/working are being forgotten.  The onboarding process was poor-one day of computer training for basic info, the rest is ""figure it out on your own.""  Very disappointing.  Management needs to wake up but I don't think they care enough to change."
Frasier Meadows,1c7uu3grdaqjf8hf,2.0,"Management is not available and does not support staff.  Management is most concerned about making money and making sure their apartments are filled. Staff are overworked and staff are taking on roles that they are not trained for.  The leadership team makes it clear that they do not want to make changes.  There is no onboarding or training and staff are left to fend for themselves. The mgmt team has no sense of what is going on in the day to day operations, but ultimately they make the final decisions about things.  Staff are very stressed and unhappy.  Poor communication.  Many staff that are in leadership positions do not have the skills to carry out their job responsibilities.  There is a lack of support and guidance.  Many of the management team members speaks poorly about staff.  Management is not aware of the policies or procedures, or there aren't any in place.  Bad behavior-unethical decisions-by leadership is allowed."
Frasier Meadows,1c63cta02akaubem,5.0,"I love working here, everyone is friendly, lots of opportunity for growth within the company. The PTO is amazing, and all employees receive discounted meals at the restaurant inside.Its also a beautiful building, well maintained. Amazing view of Flat Irons."
Frasier Meadows,1bstfflp11ba76gs,5.0,"It is great place to work. I like working 12 hours 3 days a week. Great pay with good benefit. but, I wanted to work less days with more hours. I have children and 5 days a week is hard."
Frasier Meadows,1bpf51795b8609mr,4.0,"A good place to work, very little to no advancement opportunities. A place for the elderly so if you don't like all that comes with it not a good place for you."
Frasier Meadows,1bkf2rlm2as0s83a,5.0,"Frasier Meadows cares deeply about their residents as well as their employees. Constructive criticism is always taken into consideration and they reward employees through positive reinforcement, which makes anyone happy to work there. My only issue is the Relias training that's due every month because it's hard to get that done while taking care of residents but that is my only complaint."
Frasier Meadows,1bjlfarouak95blb,5.0,"Frasier Meadows is filled with a lot of really great people to work with.  The residents are fantastic, educated and spirited elderly....loved it. I would work here, if I lived in Boulder."

Frasier Meadows,1bf31f69qak8m8oa,4.0,"I worked for Frasier Meadows for close to 11 years. I was lucky to be able to work in the Independent Living/retirement community area. Unfortunately, at the point when I left, the ""family"" feel that I had always enjoyed working at Frasier was being replaced with a more corporate attitude."

Frasier Meadows,1bdi4ok4makhlcrm,4.0,"I loved working at Frasier and was sad when I had to leave to return to school as a full-time student. Mostly everyone there was extremely nice including management, HR, and residents. There were only a few co-workers that I worked with that did not treat me with respect. Overall, I had a great experience at Frasier."
Frasier Meadows,1b6mrei37ak979uv,4.0,Frasier Meadows is not a bad place to work. Everyone has fun during their shifts .Management needs to be more involved with the staff. At times and most of the time your co-workers can make you the point of interest. Not in a good way.
Frasier Meadows,1at73vpe7ak7iciv,5.0,"Frasier is the best place I have ever worked.  The staff is wonderful, many of them have been at Frasier for over 5 years.  The residents are so lovely and knowledgeable."
Frasier Meadows,1aqqk9apvaqil913,4.0,"Typical day at Frasier goes by very fast and very busy but I love it. I learned vary much, learned managing my time, learned new skills. Management has been okay for me, once very supportive and then not so much. The most enjoyable part of the job is to being a problem solver for patients, family members, providers, CNAs and colleagues."
Frasier Meadows,1a6tg5loeas2jcj5,3.0,The CNA's are extremely overworked. Job functions had to always be performed in a rushed fashion. It always felt like you could not offer the residents the time needed for adequate care.

Ricoh,1f5tc3ciqu3af800,3.0,"Ridiculous schedules, poor management and they all answer to the clueless execs in Japan. Leaders are only looking out for themselves and constantly leave the grunge work for the worker bees with zero appreciation."
Ricoh,1f7tnaicau1m4800,2.0,"Working at Ricoh is a contract position and can end at any time and it will. They pay below the national average and you are expected to do what ever the customer wants, they will make you do way more than the contract is allowed. Ricoh, I all about ""YES"" to everything and this is causing ""Scope Creap"" on the  account and employees will be way over worked and management will not do anything. I do believe in giving excellent customer service but, when management and sales just keep taking...this is not right."
Ricoh,1f7rp8v30u1m4800,4.0,Great if you are carrer driven and want to grow in different areas of skills. That can push you to the next level. Compensation can be matched to skills
Ricoh,1f7r38q2h3gtf000,2.0,"Management is terrible.  There are problems with the machines which make performing your job extremely difficult but, management will ignore the problems and expect you to still make productivity.  Problems are not solved, they put a band aid on a bullet wound and keep it moving."
Ricoh,1f7ofn94oo25r800,3.0,Ricoh is the best company to work if you are beginner. But no salary increase in 3 years and management wants to change entire system of company so hardware guys are struggling
Ricoh,1f7ce56gh3kis000,2.0,"They do nothing for their employees, other than pay them (and the pay isn't even great.) I rarely spoke with management unless someone had reported that I did something wrong. Poor management!"
Ricoh,1f6i7efsgu1pa800,3.0,Easy place to work. Only thing is there isn't much by way of career growth. Nice facility and and it pretty low stress most of the time. They should work harder on promoting employee development.
Ricoh,1f6civbic3ocs000,3.0,"Duties rarely change, and most days are predictable. Not the most exciting job, but fairly easy. Some days are more busy than others, and occasionally the work piles up."
Ricoh,1f68eiar2o1gm800,2.0,"As a Field Support Representative, I am placed at different sites on a weekly basis. I work with mailroom processing, print/fleet production, and occasionally reception. I get moved from one site to another up to two times a week. We don't see our schedule for the following week until every Friday, sometimes as late as 7:00. When we are sent to different clients, we are sometimes sent in blind in terms of ""need-to-know"" information. Management has poor communication skills and will leave you hanging quite often. I heard a rumor that they don't do raises, that rumor turned out to be true as I've not received a raise since I've been here. This company needs to learn how to treat their FSR's, how to maintain good communication, and how to hire and train competent leaders and managers."
Ricoh,1f5mrnjhmsaai800,3.0,There were layoffs every year. Always looking over your shoulder towards the end of every fiscal year wondering if it was your year for the axe to drop
Ricoh,1f5hkp8pho1kn800,5.0,"You normally work alone depending on your site. Not a place for advancement. And raises are close to a cent or even a quarter if we are lucky. If you like working alone or in a small group, you will be fine."
Ricoh,1f5464083sa39800,3.0,Pay wasn't very good took 8 months on a temp basis to make it in. Day to day is basic logistic wasn't really any room for moving up so yearly raises sucked.
Ricoh,1f4mo2b8nt5m6800,5.0,Flexibility and room for advancements.  Training via Ricoh website provides many opportunities to increase knowledge of practices  to help customers.
Ricoh,1f4eth0tfu392800,3.0,Found Ricoh to be a good place to wok with good people.  Learned a lot about the sales process as it relates to an analyst role in the industry.
Ricoh,1f4ciiba0u39f800,1.0,Site management was terrible for print services. More focus needed on growing employees. Print services manager was not professional and utilized company time for personal gain.
Ricoh,1f47gmjhis7ju800,4.0,"Working here was a really good experience, everyone is very kind and friendly. The job itself is very straightforward and fun. You will learn new things everyday"
Ricoh,1f46us3vnt5di800,3.0,Good place if you need a job but definitely a dead end job. Very toxic environment for being such a small group. Do not consider if you’re looking for long term.
Ricoh,1f45e8g6fu20v800,1.0,The worst management I have ever worked for. Definite inequality in pay. Mistreatment and beyond disrespectful to staff. Horrible! Lousy pay. Lousy benefits. HR makes excuses for the managements mistreatment of staff.
Ricoh,1f45bps0gs7ju800,2.0,"When I first arrived, I enjoyed what I did. I enjoyed the managers and my co-workers. I took pride in my work and felt appreciated. However, over the course of time, things started to change it and became more about meeting metrics than anything else which was something they told me when I was interviewed that they didn’t do."
Ricoh,1f3vrp0acs7ju800,3.0,I’ve been here a few years and it has been good. I don’t think there will be any advancement. We are always afraid of being let go with the current situations. Pay is okay.
Ricoh,1f3tlb42ou1vt800,4.0,Management was really understanding and great to work with. Many opportunities to grow within the company. The scope of work was fun and not too difficult.

Ricoh,1f3g1u5qto2a8800,1.0,Office printers are like video machines. They are going obsolete.  Although we will still need printers they are all designed to be customer serviceable with remote assist service.
Ricoh,1f3f4t6tdu3bc800,3.0,"I have a supervisor that pretty much leaves me alone to run the shift however I need to. Pay could be a lot better, but I can pretty much do whatever during the shift as long as everything is done when it needs to be."
Ricoh,1f3b3qb093guf000,5.0,"The Ricoh I worked at was a great place to work, I learned a lot and grew into the job. If I hadn't moved I'd still work there. Working with the hospital and making forms was interesting and educational."
Ricoh,1f3b1met33guf000,3.0,"If they'd just let the techs do their job without all the micromanagement, it'd be an ok place to work. My local manager was always great but area/corporate was always changing the goalposts"
Ricoh,1f38i4lbpu3bc800,4.0,"I was employed by Ricoh, but worked as a contractor for another agency. I really liked my job, but it could sometimes get confusing with all the different people to report to and rules to follow, sometimes seemed counterintuitive to follow Ricoh rules when the company we actually worked for had different ones."
Ricoh,1f333mlgtu1v3800,4.0,I am payed lower than most on my team so pay in general might not be that bad. My direct
Ricoh,1f2tnd5s43ki8000,3.0,"Ricoh is a great place to work if you’re just starting out. They have great benefits and offer lots of holidays. But I was also a contractor for SDGE and know that some of the holidays were due to our contract. There is not a lot of room from growth in the Copy Center. Most days are filled with minimal copying, and then a large job will come in that takes a couple of days to complete. The work culture here is quiet and friendly. If you’re in leadership, you can expect a lot of paperwork and meetings. Good first job, but not somewhere you can grow without years of experience."
Ricoh,1f2pmafi9309g000,3.0,"Good benefits, somewhat decent pay.  Good for the self-starter types as management can be a bit out of reach.  Good vacation time, floating holidays but can be tricky getting coverage."
Ricoh,1f2pjmh1m3ki8000,3.0,Not sure how this company is still a float with the way management glares down upon its employees. The complaints about workers only making minimum wage when the McDonalds down the street will pay $15 starting really wears you down mentally. Expectations are high and the pay is little.
Ricoh,1f25s58vpu1v3800,1.0,"Over the course of my employment with Ricoh USA, I had my fair share of managers. (this is due to Ricoh making changing within the company). Most of those managers were good people, but there are a few really BAD apples in there, as well."
Ricoh,1f252kl8it45n800,4.0,"I have worked for Ricoh for over 6 years and I can say it is a good company to work for. The customers and people you meet are very professional depending on the office you work in. And as an FSR or traveling service rep you are reinbursed for your travel time. As a contracter for Ricoh though there is very limited was to move in the company, you can on the other hand work at variety of different sites."
Ricoh,1f24d5c8ahim2800,3.0,"Typically, a good work environment if you can handle some level of stress.  Limited growth opportunities in some areas of the business.  Due to a shrinking industry, company has to constantly reinvent itself every few years."
Ricoh,1f22d3vc7s798800,3.0,"No job security,  low pay overworked and management is a joke. Stay clear from this place !! Management is basis and clingy. Unfair advancements treatments and a unbearable work load"
Ricoh,1f2263otbhim2800,1.0,"The best benefit is the work/life balance. The work is very easy, the workload is usually light, and there is little to no stress. Moving around in the company is relatively easy. The pay is terrible and you can go years without a raise. The benefits are pretty standard - medical insurance is high, two weeks of vacation for the first five years, sick time accrues slowly."
Ricoh,1f207mcf3u3hv800,4.0,"Great company , You work early get off late. Lots of overtime, . Great co workers and friendly environment. Days can be really busy but also some slow days in which you can work in the warehouse. you are guaranteed your 40 hours."
Ricoh,1f1vdkq0fo15n800,2.0,"For a technician job, they pay waaay too little. They expect you to work as if they are paying you a livable wage but in reality, they are paying few dollars more than minimum wage."
Ricoh,1f1ptmrdrt4pr800,5.0,I was paired with a senior Technician who gave me hands-on training. I was given the tools and training I need to Excell at my job. The hardest part of the job was Identifying what the problem was with the printer. But that was the challenge that I faced every day. Management encouraged me to take the time to learn the job and even kept me busy with different aspects of my job. I Loved this job.
Ricoh,1f1l9q7d8t4pr800,3.0,They keep brining in new top management to 'clean up'. Once thousands of people have been laid off they move on for the next one to come in and continue. No one is safe anymore. It's impossible to feel safe and there's the constant fear of being let go.
Ricoh,1f1ghhs953klv000,1.0,"Extremely poor management, with unrealistic expectations for the service technicians.  The main company purpose seems to be the production of thousands of spreadsheets full of meaningless ""metrics"".  All other activities are merely engaged in to produce numbers for the all important spreadsheets.   There is no recognition, no raises, and your job is constantly hanging by a thread.  At the whim of corporate Japan, literally anyone can be fired for no other reason than that they don't want to pay your salary and benefits.  Those that remain are expected to do the work of two or even three people."
Ricoh,1f12jnqgat4b9800,4.0,"Enjoyable workplace that's fast paced. Workload is busiest when school is in session, and management is always available for support or to answer questions. It's a great entry level job or first job right out of high school."

Ricoh,1f1109414n54g800,1.0,This could be a great place to work if senior management had a clue as to how to go about onboarding of new employees. There was no oversight as to what was expected in the position and my coworkers were only concerned with their own job security
Ricoh,1f0ui9hc23o8h000,4.0,Was a good company to work for until mass layoff and outsourcing to the Philippines.  They had fun group activities and fundraisers for food causes. A lot of long term employees.
Ricoh,1f0rebnlvs7jc800,3.0,It's copiers and every part of doing it is to service the company and any other person's agenda. Lots of finger-pointing. The tenured folks are just collecting their money so far into an inglorious career that they just finish it out. The industry is a bad one especially if you truly enjoy people. They'll cut your throat later.
Ricoh,1f01o86j4sa1j800,2.0,Management has a loosing strategy. Poor maintenance of infrastructure creates constant downtime that turns into overtime.  Management has little interest in the people.
Ricoh,1evvjm1mgsa1j800,1.0,They aren't concerned with employees at all. Improving their income as a company is above everything. You  are just another number to them. Favoritism is strong in this company as well.
Ricoh,1evsdjo9j26a4000,1.0,Bad leadership with no idea how to change with the times.  They don't value experience just want to hire for the least amount.  No job security no matter how you perform.
Ricoh,1evqe5bmf26a4000,1.0,A circus like culture. Once you think you understand your role and leadership it changes.  Either the client changes their environment or the wonky upper management of Ricoh comes up with some new initiative or direction. Incredibly weak HR-outsouced to ADP-and your contact there is subject to change. The Ricoh managed services support staff (marketing and district manager) are laughable. Just stay out of the account and let me get the work done. Morale is terrible.
Ricoh,1evedfu23n51t800,5.0,"I was there four years before we were laid off. My direct manager was great, she set me up to succeed. The culture is good, they always had something going on for us like blood drives, cancer screening holiday pot lucks and monthly team outings."
Ricoh,1ev7tuhl5n55l800,3.0,If you like to drive from place to place this is the company for you.
Ricoh,1eupb2u6ho15p800,1.0,No raise in 2 years. No advancements. Not given enough shirts to wear. I would not recommend this company to anyone. You are expected to do more work than one person. There is always open positions so we are always short handed.
Ricoh,1eumhtpsqu1ki800,4.0,"Overall great experience, Great Team - good training, clear communication from management. Fun motivational meetings. Changes in CRM system at the time was a little confusing but we managed to get through it. I learned a good deal about technical sales and software packages."
Ricoh,1eulpcikao15p800,4.0,"Stable,  easy work for decent pay. Relaxed"
Ricoh,1euj749r9s7gh800,3.0,"I no longer work there but I recall a lot of stress on the job. It was a very fast-paced, monotonous position. It started out great - I was promoted from an associate level within six months, but moving up all depends on whether you are ""in"" with your current manager."
Ricoh,1eu8p66bqs7gh800,4.0,High tech office hardware/software company. A place to advance if you put in the effort. A lot can be learned. Good people. Stable and ethical management.
Ricoh,1eu4o6licn5b7800,4.0,Ricoh is a great company to work for the benefits are great the ability to work at different locations is a great cross training tool and it helps you.
Ricoh,1eu27qo40n5b4800,2.0,"Ricoh did an AWFUL job of navigating COVID.  I believe they used it as an excuse to do what they wanted to do for years in decreasing their headcount by 25%.  They don’t care about their employees, only the shareholders.  Even loyal, hard working employees with long tenure are susceptible to being tossed out.  Hope your manager doesn’t play favorites, or that you’re the favorite, because you’ll be sent packing otherwise."
Ricoh,1etv2s8lgu312800,2.0,"Do not work for this company,  they expect their drivers to be copy technicians since 35% of the techs were laid off due to the pandemic,  HR is not helpful at all when it comes to reporting safety concerns and they will not compensate you on the extra workload you are expected perform due to the pandemic, management is awful!!"
Ricoh,1etq1nu42u312800,2.0,Good hours and benefits. Nice location with overall nice people. Pay could be a lot better and more on par with today's standards. Culture is tough because everyone is treat very unequally.
Ricoh,1et7p1cvpu1n1800,3.0,Work is not fairly distributed amongst employees working in the same department/title neither is financial compensation. You will become stagnant due to management not assisting with or encouraging promotions. Very little room for growth.
Ricoh,1et795jlst52l800,3.0,I worked here for almost nine years fixing copiers. My manager was a decent guy. It wasn't bad but it's a typical impersonal corporate structure. Don't expect much advancement.

Ricoh,1esuligkdsa2t800,2.0,No matter what you do meeting KPI's are impossible. Management is  horrible and doesn't have a clue what is going on or how to resolve issues. It was a clown show.
Ricoh,1estlr9mgu1lf800,5.0,"I worked on 3rd shift which was good because it gave me time to take daughter to school, and pick up from school. And as job was relocating and I've worked on 2nd & 1st."
Ricoh,1esp8i3nfu3cn800,3.0,"Before the pandemic, my manager was a mean, micro-manager who would try to dictate every part of the day even when she wasn't there. Once the pandemic hit, I couldn't be more relieved to be finally free from her! I got a week off until I got a depressing call that she had recommended me to work at another site -___-. This site was a lot better though! It was a copy center and, due to the pandemic, there wasn't much work to be done. I really enjoyed it there. Everybody (manager and co-workers) in the copy center was excellent. I miss them! There were days where I had to go to the mailroom which I HATED!! Eventually, they wanted me to stay in the mailroom and I just couldn't let myself go through that so I resigned the day they told me that I'd have to report there everyday instead of the copy center. </3 :( Overall, Ricoh itself is pretty good I guess. Good benefits, decent pay (?). Not really enough for me to move out comfortably on my own though. I heard some not-so-great stories about my first manager from co-workers at both sites and how many times HR has been contacted about her but nothing was done. Disappointing really."
Ricoh,1esjems21t4je800,1.0,"There are no good words for this company from management on down. The only thing I could say if any, they definitely treat everyone the same....no respect"
Ricoh,1esink08dt4lr800,3.0,"Easy enough job to handle and a decent pay for the work. Very big on scope of work (but doesn't matter in the end cause if the clients want something they'll more than be happy to oblige). Lot of busy work. Big on Acronyms.  As for on the job training, they'll team you up with some one for a few days to get the gist of what ever software you'll be using and then they'll pretty much provide you with the tools and training videos to figure out rest. So you have to have a learning mentality. I was fortunate enough to have a manager who would also assist me as I was looking for answers. My only issue is that wasn't a fan of the client I worked for. It kind of soured the company as a whole for me. However, someone else might have better luck."
Ricoh,1esg6mgp6saah800,4.0,"I was very happy working those 10 years, then last year I had to quit. I got promoted twice. It’s a company that you can make a lot of money and the opportunity to grow."
Ricoh,1esf17o9tt4l7800,2.0,Really wish management would get they stuff more organized and recognize those who are actually doing the bulk of the work and not the person that’s in your face most of the time just having a conversation that has nothing to do with work and gets work backed up for others to do. The committee team are the best people in Ricoh and is highly missed. Wish everyone was like the moral committee..
Ricoh,1erse75bpu1sr800,4.0,"The most enjoyable part of the job was being out in the field and putting smiles on customers faces, when we walked in the door to repair their equipment."
Ricoh,1erp2spbou1sr800,4.0,Enjoyed working in the field but had my job eliminated due to Covid. My direct manager was great but upper management was only concerned about the numbers that would make them look good and yet were very disconnected to the field front line.
Ricoh,1ern57j0ro17p800,1.0,"Very poor culture! Employees are treated as commodities, the Japanese culture does not value the individual. They change process without feedback or consulting the boots on the ground...they cancel things that work for things that are unproven....very odd approach. Managers are feckless due to corporate tyranny"
Ricoh,1era74heasa97800,3.0,"great recruitment process, quick onboarding and great support, but frequent layoffs and reconstructions - if you have other options I would go with them."
Ricoh,1er9oeffku49m800,3.0,"Working for the company was okay. The pay was nice, good job security if you did the work. The training was good and paid for. It was stressful from time to time, especially when you can’t figure out what the issue is and you have calls to go to after. Good benefits."
Ricoh,1er724rjao2gt800,3.0,"Forget about calling in sick, because all your coworkers will have to pickup your slack. And if someone requested the day off, you cant call sick. Other than that they give great benefits! Every worker is disposable! So if you want a job where you can advance, this isnt the one."
Ricoh,1er2ggib8u49m800,2.0,Upper management will run this company into the ground.  'IT' sucks up too much company money.  Corporate in Japan only cares about the bottom line - dollars - and not its employees.
Ricoh,1eqq0nngfu49m800,4.0,I would focus on the large page print division that they bought from IBM after I left the company.  Management in Irvine was top notched and so were the high level technology people as well.
Ricoh,1eqpugb79sa97800,3.0,Compensation & benefits is pretty good. They have good principles but seem to be scattered all over the place. Very frustrating. Need better training
Ricoh,1eqarel7cu35m800,3.0,"Benifits,direct manager and co workers are very good. The upper management asks you to do tasks you are not trained or hired for. They are monitoring everything you do. They do not give you all the tools needed to complete your tasks every day. Customer frequently must wait due to management."
Ricoh,1eq6p45m8u35m800,3.0,"Ricoh is a good place to work. Just need to show up and get things done. Great Vacation, Sick Days, and Great Work and Life Balance. Pay is still low."
Ricoh,1eq11c5s0u49m800,2.0,"This company is not inclusive and does misleads all potential candidates of position. This position requires beyond mailing and 80% of your work day requirements are in their contracted warehouse doing extremely heavy lifting without the proper safety equipment required. Poor training, clients lack communication and do not value each other. They say overtime is provided but you need a written with reason and signature to authorize overtime within a specific timeline. This company gives unfair pay. There is a lot of drama and unprofessionalism at this location. The companies policies are international. Lack of communication within its management.  They have one employee to do a three-man’s job. You are not to associate with the client or their functions to which they have many of. Ricoh employees are excluded. Lack of empathy. Payroll process is terrible, the process takes a month before you receive your first paycheck. They have you on a contract before they make you an employee with them and you end up with a huge gap in your pay."

Job description was misleading. I never would have applied if I knew this was at a hospital. Pay is terrible. Benefits are terrible, but advertised as wonderful; things that seem great at first actually aren't. Ricoh equipment is cheap and constantly breaking, making it difficult to do my job well."
Ricoh,1epc0hjruu32a800,2.0,"Things were fine during the first two years in the Chesapeake, VA location. The management was pretty laid back.  Toward the pandemic, the dress code became more regulated, and the managers started breathing down their employee’s necks.  All of a sudden, mistakes were not acceptable.  Favoritism around the office became more apparent, and the favorites’ mistakes weren’t paid attention to.  In two months, I went from working in the office, working remotely, and then working at an Anthem location during the pandemic."
Ricoh,1ep8oqskat4it800,2.0,"My summary of Ricoh  is a company that is a micro-managed company if you like that type of atmosphere. They pay their delivery drivers low for the amount of work they want you to do. Ex ..Ricoh expects you to deliver,  set up , connect IP addresses , transfer address books, train the customers and take the customers old copier . Oh did I forget they give you a  machine called a stairclimber to use if any stairs are involved  , by yourself to operate. Plus management will watch your time on the field if your taking to long and bring it to your attention and treat you like a little kid about it . Ricohs annual raises are a joke too...I've worked at 2 other places after Ricoh already and at both employers I was offered at least 3 dollars more an hour on average and the work was a quarter amount compared to what Ricoh wants out of you. So look at Ricoh as your last option."
Ricoh,1ep7n31suu32a800,4.0,"I loved it at Ricoh. We only got let go due to being bought out by another company. My manager was VERY compassionate and understanding; always spoke to you like a father would. He actually LISTENED to what you were saying; not just hearing you and brushing you off. The job itself was interesting. You'd call an office and the conversations were just a hoot. I disklike the dress code, but I was pregnant at the time so trying to find that balance between comfy and business casual was difficult, especially in the winter time. I'd go back if we had the opportunity to. I just wouldn't want to drive in everyday. That got exhausting."
Ricoh,1ep5b32h22v69000,3.0,Company is struggling to identify its place and products. COVID has accelerated this change. Not sure where it will lead but I think the goal is to shift the entire sales process to regional dealers.
Ricoh,1ep1m5rgn3oec000,4.0,"I actually enjoyed working for Ricoh quite a bit in the 7 years I was there. There was minimal micromanagement, pay was decent, and benefits were good. As the only Ricoh employee on-site, I felt well encouraged to make the site my own, and that feeling of ownership led to a strong personal connection to site goals. For the first 6 years, I couldn't have asked for more, however when the workload became too much for a single person site, help was very lacking and the production began to suffer. This was the ultimate reason for my eventual transfer, which was much too far for a daily commute, and it was more like I'd just been brushed under the carpet with expectations that I'd quit, and I did."
Ricoh,1ep11tgkru3ib800,3.0,"Good and bad, corporate America.  Low OT basically 9 to 5. Covid has been hard on the industry lots of furlough and some layoffs, see how the company can bounce back"

Ricoh,1eodi88opnpig800,5.0,For a large company it was a real nice place to work. I switched careers from a Senior Service Tech for 10 years to Sales. A great move on my part. Left Ricoh for more money at a smaller family owned business.
Ricoh,1eobflcjou2no800,1.0,The BS sites are not at all a friendly place to work most of their employees are rude and management is very incompetent and upper management has no clue of what's going on around them.
Ricoh,1eo8r32cp3h84000,2.0,"While my coworkers were outstanding, management is severely misguided.  The end user is their only priority. Their mission statement does not reflect the culture. I witnessed first hand favoritism over seniority. End users would request me to work at their site, I had nothing but positive feedback from the key contacts and yet I was laid off.  My peers in the same position as me where kept on board. I was deceived by management. They strung me along and ultimately let me go. I never had any corrective action or write ups. If you voice your opinion, ask questions or challenge management to see a different perspective you will be shunned. Stay far, far away."

Ricoh,1eo09eh85o15h800,2.0,"Many people see Ricoh as a stepping stone into the job market. The job is decent but the management flounders. l'm not sure why this is but they were punishing the techs for management decisions. The management is always right and the techs are always wrong. Teams have a good working relationship most of the time but the company policies don't make a lot of sense. It often gave me the impression that upper management didn't know what they were doing. Customer tools for the office environment were excellent but internal tools for doing the job were subpar like the management was easily bullied by sales reps and didn't take the time to see if the tools worked well for us. The climate often felt like ""business as usual"" no matter how many climate surveys we did."
Ricoh,1ens3s6svnpn0800,1.0,"I have been with the company for over 10 years. Though there was a boom following the last recession of new customers, there has been a constant loss of 1 to 2 customers per year over the past 4 years. Some of this is due to the staff on site, but most of this is due to failures from the sales teams to billing to management."
Ricoh,1enn7hsv3t44v800,1.0,"It's not worth it. Retail pays better (I've worked here for several years and Target pays $15 while we get just under $12). The pay raises are terrible.

Ricoh,1en69f3o4o22b800,4.0,Ricoh's managers suck. They are afraid of employees knowing to much and fear for their positions in the company...

Ricoh,1emt65usuu3sj800,3.0,"The only good part about this job is its only 8 min from my home and my supervisor is flexible about life obligations i.e. appts, etc. Other than than that, the pay compared to the work required is laughable, no annual raises, they hire you for one thing and expect you to do everything...they don't show appreciation for their hardworking employees. Lots of lies and underhanded sneaky things going on among management."
Ricoh,1empm7vu6s7fh800,1.0,"I can say that this is/was an interesting working moment. I gave my rating because the job itself starts off ok since you're learning the ropes...However that begins to quickly fade once you begin to fully work work.. Between the team and management (before new management arrived) the experience was/is horrible. When you think you can go to upper senior for help, but don't ask for help when they are finished with their work because they think you are interrupting them. You're better off learning a few things on your own. There is a lot of gossip so please be careful of what you say to some ""co-workers"" because your words will get twisted around and next thing you know your in the office with a manager. Instead of an individual talking with you first to solve an issue."

The Directors (3) and the VP of Sales are totally disconnected from the sales staff and don't listen to valid concerns that drive revenue, increase profits and keep quality sales people on staff.  Bottom line they are a broken operation with no direction or desire to fix the problem. Advise to Middle management is to step up to the plate!  Make your sales managers accountable for supporting your sales teams or provide sales support to them.  You have to invest in supporting your sales staff in order to achieve success.  If I had one of my sales reps go to a manager for help and they said they didn't know and walked away, I would say they are in the wrong position.  How can you manage a team of sales reps and not know how to do the job yourself!  To the Directors and the VP of Sales...start putting qualified managers in place instead of the ""guy you like.""  The ""guy you like"" doesn't always do what makes you look good nor is he qualified to ""LEAD"" a team to success!"
Ricoh,1em53aj25s7e8800,2.0,"The co workers (most) were outstanding.  But then they had the lame butt kissers. They would make stuff up, and the bad managers (most all managers were bad)  would threaten to write you up or call HR.  HR sided with management, even if you had proof.  Management would constantly violate the company's principals and code of ethics.  Nothing would be done about it."
Ricoh,1em45un01o16r800,3.0,Management wasn't the best. Communication wasn't so good either no balance. Only thing that made it good working there was my co-workers. Had to fix a lot of managements mistakes and would get no credit.
Ricoh,1em0radduu2u5800,2.0,"They got rid of all but a small percentage of their sales people, hired telemarketers to sell equipment they've never seen, they've gotten rid of a majority of their senior, experienced and talented technicians either by poisoning the work well, early retirement or voluntary separation and hired unskilled,much lower paid, inexperienced people to replace SOME of them. They're losing market share, reputation and a ton of money."

At the offsite location for ExxonMobil the workplace culture was HEAVY for safety and safety enforcement for all employees and contractors due to the nature of the company. I learned on-the-job first time how to ""endure"" this new culture starting on my first day! It was very difficult at first. But my manager was wonderful at showing me how to do and what to do. I worked closely with the safety team and the other managers to provide all levels of support for whatever they needed and for all team members. This is what I enjoyed the most about my job there.

Ricoh,1ehsc4b6lr53c800,2.0,"I have served as both a field representative and an onsite representative, and the field position is the better by far. As a field rep, you cover onsite reps for sick and vacation days. Sometimes you get assignments a day or two before but it's normal to get your assignment the morning of and report for work at a site. Every site is a little different but generally as long as you are ready to help and attentive they appreciate you. As you are covering different sites the hours can vary anywhere between 7 am to as late as 7 pm. You only work 8 hours though and as a field rep you get compensation for mileage. The only real difficulty you may experience is traffic, as you are usually going to be going into a site during rush hour and because you are receiving assignment sometimes the same day it's impossible to plan around the traffic. But you will not be considered late if you are stuck in traffic after getting assignment the same day. You also get to work in different work environments and different locations with new people all the time. It is a different story being an onsite rep though. The client's and some of their staff can be incredibly fickle and demanding. For example, the acceptable procedure for processing mail can work for a staff with about 20 different secretaries but you will be asked to do things differently for just one. And this will be normal for several procedures. You will also see mistakes made and deal with them but if you make an error it becomes a grave situation. Some site leaders are also lacking in leadership qualities as they are usually promoted"
Ricoh,1ehs9lb41r53c800,3.0,"I believe that Ricoh can work on paying their employee's a better salary. Taking a trip funded by the company is OK but, giving a increase to accommodate the cost of living would be greatly appreciated."

Also understand that this is NOT an American company. This is a Japanese company, with Japanese rules and expectations, that happens to be based in America. Read up on the Japanese business culture before accepting a job with them. For example, no wastepaper baskets allowed, smiling and talking are discouraged, and long hours are expected."

Ricoh,1efn8l1t43chj000,1.0,"I came on with Ricoh in March of 2019. The job was very different from anything I've ever done before, but they were offering paid training, so I went for it. Things started off alright with my mentor, but after about a month, they considered me ""ready"" to go out on my own. Beforehand, my mentor would explain minimal things to me, but not enough to where I was ready to go out on my own, but that's what management wanted. Of course, I found myself having to call and ask for help from my mentor, but his answer was always ""look in the manual"". So most of this job ended up being a self-teaching/learning, trial-by-error experience. Eventually, I started to pick it up, but at that point was when I started noticing certain things with the company. For example, how ridiculous it is to give customers the power of ""escalating"" service calls. Most of the time, customers would escalate a call AFTER you already looked at their machine and told them when a part would be arriving for it. They would escalate it because they wanted the part to arrive faster than the expected time, and of course, upper management then gets on the technician's back and that goes against their productivity rating. And to make matters worse, RICOH started laying people off (like me, and even people that have faithfully worked for them for 38+ years) because of this pandemic. In other words, they said ""let's screw them before they screw us"" and expect us to be fine with it. Then they started drowning the remaining technicians with more service calls than one person could handle. It's a shame too because I really"

Ricoh,1edtemjm63dqf000,3.0,"I believe Ricoh has a bit of a bad rep here on Indeed, which is understandable to a degree. For one the pay/benefits as you start out are pretty  bad. I started out making 15.14 an hour, but once you add in the mileage and car bonus would have been a few more dollars than that. So that's one factor to consider, your pay would depend on your productivity. I was still severely disappointed to be making so little to say the least. However the positive side is that the work was interesting, you learn a lot, the job duties were good (such as being on the road) and the company is practical (such as having several small raises for the first few years). Aside from this (as you can see by the pay) they have a bit of a cutthroat attitude and wont hesitate  to lay you off, cut your hours, cut your pay etc."
Ricoh,1edpfp3raqfle800,1.0,The job structure of this company is lacking in many ways. The management does not care about a person's well being or any opportunities that an employee wants to take within the company. It is decent pay but it is not worth the time and effort when the job duties are not clearly laid out and there is lack of communication at every location. Definitely not worth the headache and you will get written up for everysmall incident.

Ricoh,1edmf1jmm3hsb000,2.0,"After the daily morning meeting, I was on my own which was a good thing.  Management was ridiculous.  Certain employees did what they please; whether they came to work on time, or didn’t come at all, and still was counted present- nothing was never said. Go figure that. Other employees, no matter how well they worked or showed up to work, management was never satisfied. Long story , short  ; that’s the best they ever had so I guess that’s why they do what they do."

Ricoh,1edcd4e59qves800,2.0,"Was hired on as a FSR (field service representative). The job itself was very easy, you are basically a substitute or abled body to cover various positions and tasks for services within you market or region. RICOH is a managed services company meaning they contract with other businesses to do the tedious work for them. In most cases they were mainly mail, reception, hospitality and print services. RICOH will deploy a team to service the company for the set amount of time the contract exists, until terminated. While employed I had witnessed incredibly high turnover. Most places I covered for had many complaints and internal dismay among the employees, but management will never take action in fear that they lose the contract early. Managers care more for the contracts than the employees. There is no room for growth as there is no structure to job level or position. You can become a supervisor for a contracted service or a manager, but pay will not change, just your responsibilities. This company has very poor communication among management as well. The company had a solid foundation of preaching positive work attitude and had a fairly strong campaign in leading the managed services field, but updates rarely impact the contracts. The company has good intentions on services provided, but often time the managers have a hard time fulfilling those intentions by poorly executing them to the teams. The FSR role paid decent, but not enough for the living expenses in the area. Along with on call schedules, your week and days can always change. As an FSR we also had other duties to help"

Ricoh,1ecn9lb1q3dra000,1.0,Turnover has increased substantially in recent years and management has shifted from taking care of customers to micromanaging employees to produce pet metrics. The company fails to negotiate contracts that allow them to stay profitable and then uses up their employees hoping to make their profit off of internal savings and productivity. They will use up your physical health and use up your vehicle and replace you as soon as they think they can get someone younger and healthier to repeat the process.

Management sucks no structure in how things are done if they don’t like the way you do a job they have a issue with you. People that are the favorites make mistakes and it’s cover up because they have a family member who works for the company. They blame it on other workers and fire them.

Ricoh,1e6s7jr0t4tub800,1.0,"Ricoh looks excellent on paper. The CEO has a great vision. Unfortunately the Senior Managers and Directors are not on one accord with the vision of the company. HR is in not fair or impartial. They pretend to be on the side of the employees, but in the end do what Senior Managers and Directors dictate. They work you hard and when they finish with you, get rid of you. In short, racism, hatred, retaliation all play a part in how they manage."

These people abused Ricoh, Western Union and their coworkers. Had to quit as I was getting ZERO support from my management. Human Resources knew all about the abuse and hostility and all these people still work at Ricoh. All of them should be ashamed of themselves. Yelling, swearing, threatening coworkers with box cutters, racial remarks. I was setup by Management who knew all this was going on but failed to mention it. Ricoh boasts about their ethics but letting people get away with abuse and threats is the norm. The former Site Manager, the NOM, the sales team, the employees who were let to run wild and continue to do so at RPS, should all be fired. I am still traumatized by what was allowed there and still considering a law suit against all parties involved. Defamation, abuse, hostile environment... a can of worms to be uncovered by an attorney."

Ricoh,1e4ph962co15r801,2.0,"The senior management (located in Japan) continues to try and build a brand around innovation and ""digital transformation"" when the only significant revenue stream is based on selling printers. So while there is a lot of happy talk about new ideas and innovation, at the end of the day Japan wants to know how many printer were sold. No one under 50 should consider taking a job with Ricoh.

He also was having inappropriate relationships with his wotkers. He would yell at people and created a bad environment for us. Would only recommend if you are Spanish and are a female. If I was Spanish I would have been hired but I am not.
Ricoh,1e0h414btq45d801,1.0,"Great job upon arrival. They do not have anyone to properly train you. The people who are supposed to train you don’t have enough time to actually train you. There isn’t much room for advancement because if you can’t grasp what little they teach you, they get you out the door."
Ricoh,1f5tc3ciqu3af800,3.0,"Ridiculous schedules, poor management and they all answer to the clueless execs in Japan. Leaders are only looking out for themselves and constantly leave the grunge work for the worker bees with zero appreciation."
Ricoh,1e0epi24lo9mp806,4.0,A typical work day is from 8-5 with weekends and major holidays off. Over the years you have the opportunity to advance your career. My favorite part of my job was working with the customers and technicians. Most of the time your in the field working and interacting with the customers. You do have some traveling but for the most part you are home in at a reasonable time.
Ricoh,1e0dq0ll2h6ls801,1.0,i do not recommend working for this company.  job is fun and keeps me busy. no team work or communication. constantly blame gets put on the newbie or the one that's different.
Ricoh,1e0diemr0q45d802,1.0,Working at Ricoh was an experience.   The compensation was very rewarding.   A typical workday would consist of talking with my customers and communicating with my employees.
Ricoh,1e0dgus3nqfrv803,2.0,"Eternally trying to revise business, and cut costs which means more layoffs on fairly consistent basis and generally poor morale. Is the result of perpetual change."
Ricoh,1e0c3mftnouci802,1.0,Management was ok but communication was missing. Took advantage of you and well underpaid. Customers would work with you but was leary of the company and equipment.
Ricoh,1e0bgpdphq5ia803,2.0,Enjoyed working hard to meet daily production quotas. Liked being able to put in as much overtime as I could to earn more money. Enjoyed having a job so close to home with so little of a commute.
Ricoh,1e0b5jkv1h6ls802,3.0,"Ricoh is a paycheck, it is not an enjoyable place to work, however. There is really very little guidance at the company and any advancement is virtually nonexistent unless you are in the club."
Ricoh,1e0b1456p4sht802,2.0,"Managers and above do not lead by example and do not lead at all.  No foresight is present it is knee jerk reactions to any event that has happened. The director was not good a supervisor or manager but never said no to his boss, he never did any work just he would pass the work downward and take credit.  Subsequently making him a very incompetent director."
Ricoh,1e09j2ga4307n002,3.0,Managers are usually stationed at clients' site overseeing printing and mails and managing employees. Engage the customer to understand their needs and resolve any issue arising.
Ricoh,1e08tnvn8307m001,3.0,Had to make 30 calls a day. Always working on your pipeline and how many contracts you had lined up for the month. Lots of meetings and management not always helpful or encouraging

Ricoh,1dvujidn4o1og802,1.0,The job at Ricoh is pretty simple in every department in my opinion. It only gets stressful due to lack of communication or employees doing their jobs half way.
Ricoh,1dvu7pkmap41a802,2.0,"Upper management good, direct manager not so good.  Healthcare was a broken dept, and it had only old leads and no new accounts.  When discussed, we had to prove it.  After it was proven management did absolutely nothing about it.  No new accounts meant less money in my pocket."
Ricoh,1dvsfqhjaoaqc803,4.0,I dont have anything to say really. The company itself is a good company. Minus slot of flaws in leadership as far as professionalism.  It it the only flaw of the company. With a better leadership team it would be a OUTSTANDING company.
Ricoh,1dvplc957osop803,1.0,Company doesn't pay decent salary or commissions.  Benefits are not that good either. If you are a college graduate you may consider spending here a year and a half the most for the experience. Also technology sales on your resume may provide an opportunity to transition to medical or Pharmaceutical sales.
Ricoh,1dvmsscj2nh7m803,5.0,I enjoyed working at Ricoh because the hours were very convenient which gives me time to spend with my family when I get home from work. God along with everyone that I worked with

Ricoh,1dvkdbnpd24qt004,2.0,I was part of the joint venture between IBM and Ricoh in 2007 that led to the spin off of IBM's Printing Systems Division to Ricoh completely in 2010. The Japanese ownership whittled away non-strategic products of the business leaving just Production Print hardware and strategic software offerings.
Ricoh,1dvb8856uh6vj803,2.0,It use to be stable work but now they are downsizing frequently. If you are highly productive you will have a good chance of a long career there. Make sure you stay in a position you are highly qualified for.

Ricoh,1dv5lk5f4hctn803,4.0,"This is a great company for someone who is good at troubleshooting. The pay is pretty good but the company seems to be heading in a new direction for technicians. Learning how to service other equipment is becoming a must so, either keep up or get left behind. Overall a good place to work."
Ricoh,1dv4ar9g8hctn803,2.0,They Offer a lot of technology to a Corporate levels in Japan what you get in the NY Metro Area there are Leaches that dress the part.  Good Company Horrible Management. However great upcoming younger prospects that are devoted to the Company.

Ricoh,1dur6aroaobqh802,4.0,I always had support from my Service Manager to succeed. The most enjoyable part was always having a happy customer when done servicing there equipment.
Ricoh,1duptha46q3a1803,1.0,The management sucks. I was site supervisor at a site and was never properly trained had to figure out everything on my own. When I transferred sites I still was never trained. I had manager that was never helpful or around because he focus on other sites. After all this I had HR called on me serval times because the FSR never like me because I made them do work.
Ricoh,1dunh39mbold8803,4.0,"No contact with recuiters! Never return emails, phone calls or social media. Iron fisted approach to days off or vacation. Pay is very low with no advancement"

Ricoh,1duiqfkn9oakq803,4.0,"I very much enjoy working for Ricoh. However, the company's outlook for the future does not emphasize my division, and that is creating a situation where employment and advancement are not realistic options for most employees."
Ricoh,1duiem0lrhdnf802,3.0,Management runs the company poorly as far as how things are done and equipment is always down had to work 3 months by myself on night shift so employees safety is of no concern
Ricoh,1dui5rq0f4t2o802,2.0,"Direction was not clear, company cares more about saving money than making employees happy. Manager had high expectations for role but pay and direction was not comparable."
Ricoh,1dug2jc9dp060807,4.0,"Excellent training program. Great commitment from Managers to your success. Very professional atmosphere. Get to know stage of the art industry technology   through seminars, hands on training and company weekly meetings. Job demands highly motivated people due to industry competition. Overall, learned a lot and enjoyed working for RICOH."
Ricoh,1dufu4l49nouj803,3.0,"relaxed atmosphere, unstable company overall, alot of outsourcing of jobs, was a wonderful place to work for in the begining until the company began loosing money in the US."
Ricoh,1dufje0p73075003,1.0,"Capital equipment company focused on hardware.  Small sales force for multiple verticals, low compensation and minimal benefits.  Lack of true leadership."
Ricoh,1duesk6iihe31803,4.0,On a typical day once you have the machines it's kind of nonstop. So for me i never got bored unless it was a slow day which wasn't that often. Coworkers made you feel like family.
Ricoh,1dueacfvchdnc804,2.0,"Little opportunity to advance, pay is below market, no sense of work culture.  Good benefits and hours. Industry leader. Would recommend if future growth is not important."

Ricoh,1du5to43758kr802,2.0,not very supportive - new management took to much control - I would not recommend this company - after my original boss left the expectations where changed
Ricoh,1du3hosd2o9u6802,2.0,"When interviewing with the managers, ask plenty of questions about the job because the job may appear in the description that it’s what you’ll be doing but when you get into the job, it’s completely different and that’s where the disappointment sets in! The pay raises are horrible and no OT under no circumstances and if so, it HAS to be a legitimate reason. You also have to plan your vacationss well in advance and put in the time early because they can deny it, even if it’s 3 or 4 months in advance."
Ricoh,1du0igtnbhbln803,4.0,Great people to work with.  team mates really help each other.  Onsite manager is very easy to talk to.  Onsite Supervisor is always there when you need assistance.
Ricoh,1dttt2pa7hbln803,2.0,Not given time to train properly and poor upper management.  Absolutely no direction from management.  Basically thrown into the deep end of the pool and told to swim.  Poor direction and almost impossible workplace.
Ricoh,1dtf8fna0nh9j803,4.0,Management made a huge purchase over 5 years ago. They over paid for a company because they did not want our competition to purchase the company. This purchase has impacted Ricoh's bottomline in a negative way.
Ricoh,1dtem3huvq3ma802,3.0,A typical day would be very busy with different job duties.  The hardest part was working in the rain.  I did like the different duties responsibilities for my workday as it would make the day go by quick.
Ricoh,1dtcq1j4i33nc003,5.0,"My Ricoh office is under contract to a large law firm. It handles legal document production, mail-room, hospitality, and other services. All Ricoh employees are expected to fill multiple roles as needed. However, I am the only one specifically detailed to the role of legal courier and court-runner. As a managed services provider for the legal industry, each assignment that Ricoh handles is unique, and for my position, especially unique, as I am making legal filings for a variety of cases, for a diverse clientele, to various courthouses at the local, state, and federal level."
Ricoh,1dt9paqtlhad1803,4.0,Go to work every day work on copiers peinters and basic networking. Going to training is always fun get to meet new people and learn new products. Driving can be a headache sometimes have to drive over 2 hours to get to a stop. some days just wear you out.
Ricoh,1dt7qe025nh9j803,1.0,"As with any company that you decide to go to work for do as much research as you can. It’s an ok place to work and gain experience so that you either make a decision to stay, or you might get laid off, or you can use your experience to find a better job somewhere else. Just keeping it real. I know what happened to me."
Ricoh,1dt7ful5nhad1802,1.0,"My short time at ricoh was a nightmare. There is no appreciation for anything you do unless you're a higher up. To advance in the company you have to have been there for around 10 years. My lead, let's call her ""M"" was an absolute nightmare. Nothing was ever right to her, even if it was done the way she told you to do it. And our team lead, scott.. what a self absorbed, entitled, moronic, two faced backstabbing idiot"
Ricoh,1dt2peek833nc002,1.0,There is no increase in compensation with the increase in workload. There is no drive to do anything when the boss comes in and sits down behind his computer and watches YouTube videos all day. It’s just not the environment I want to be in anymore.
Ricoh,1dt1p3vlsp04r803,3.0,"I enjoyed working with my fellow techs (very skilled and competent) but in recent years, in attempting to redefine the company management lost focus.."
Ricoh,1dsq7otehq3m9803,3.0,"I wasn't expecting a major job move here, but after my interview and accepting the position, I thought there was a fair level of equal expectation. The hiring manager knew I was looking for a job with quick growth potential. I was told a number of things would be available to me, including flexible work location and the ability to increase the job profile. In fact, only the pay rate that was promised has been accurate."
Ricoh,1dspqjsfr33nc001,3.0,"Work hours are great. Benefits are ok. Job requires alot of driving. YOU WILL NOT WORK CLOSE TO HOME. THIS IS A LIE. managers lie and only do what's convenient  for themselves not the team. Also your ""team"" is everyone for themselves."
Ricoh,1dspilpji33nc002,4.0,"Fun working environment. good team spirit and supportive environment. Unfortunately lacked corporate support, not enough staff. I was the sole operator, and literally the site could shut down if I called in sick."
Ricoh,1dspfqltshc33803,3.0,"Not able to move within the company, after many years and earnings a degree you would hope to move up. They should have in place tools to promote more diversity in upward management."

Ricoh,1dsmui1nlhad1800,3.0,Need better management skills
Ricoh,1dslv9r93q59n802,4.0,Sales support by management was great but they decided to close the sales division nationwide. Company now uses resellers to service corporate accounts.
Ricoh,1dslkbt4hq3m9802,3.0,This company can be a great place to work if your manager and co-workers are great. I had both and enjoyed the job.  Left for advancement potential.  Pay is low.
Ricoh,1dsj49q2j33nc001,4.0,"I'm lucky enough to have one of the most amazing bosses that I've ever had. The job itself is very demanding but easy if you are good at self management, time management, and taking care of your site. The most enjoyable part of the job is all of the people and interaction with others. Ricoh requires a lot of unnecessary online training classes which can be very time consuming and take away from actual work. They are also a very low paid company. Considering I am an assistant site manager and all of the responsibilities that on are me, I would anticipate a higher paid wage than what I am currently at after being with them for over 6 years. However, between sick time, floating holidays and vacation, I have almost 6 weeks paid vacation a year which can make up for the lack of wages."
Ricoh,1dsj1q972nh9j802,1.0,"Closed entire department due to missmanagment. Managers were cherrypicking tasks for favorite reps, stole money from our activities budget, and basically show us how to fail at business."
Ricoh,1dsdqum89hda6800,4.0,"Not a bad company, just your position in it, Depends on your role, either in a managed service or company direct. Culture is good and PTO as well. I can't complain otherwise."

Ricoh,1ds8c1v47h3oi802,2.0,"Am looking for something ""better"". If found will leave. But company has same review, If company finds someone better bye. Pay make looking for some easier"
Ricoh,1ds51edqkh3gg801,1.0,"Management team will say and do what it takes to make themselves look good. They have no idea how to develope, encourage, or boost moral. Management consistently deliver empty promises and are not consistant of anything else.  If your strive and learn quickly, you will not be bothered. If you struggle, there's no development. Start looking for another job. It becomes a hostile/miserable work env. HR protects the company  and management.  Remember,  that t is their job and what they are hired for."
Ricoh,1ds2eqp8vo1ai802,2.0,As a whole...the company is like ever other company...just know if your a majority advancement will not be an option for you...so if your comfortable with just getting a check then this the company for you

While my position was PSS1 (Print Support Specialist 1) my duties were not of the position but that of collecting meters across 500+ printing devices and meeting with department heads to verify billing for ""prints per click"".  With this position, I was able to rectify $100K in billing corrections owed to Ricoh from Metro.  After metro moved to a new contract, I was able to make the Dell account for Ricoh profitable for the first time since the contract's inception by billing out labor as needed for event setups on a one person basis rather than using excess labor that was unnecessary."
Ricoh,1drop17q20mcp002,2.0,"I have over 10 year's experience as a copier technician but Ricoh put me in a mail room position, and said I had to be a mail clerk feild service representative for a year and then I could apply for another position.

Ricoh,1dr6ib82q24f2002,4.0,"Ricoh is a good company to work for, I could not have asked for a better supervisor, when it comes to being fair and advancing his employees as he sees fit, he will do it, but I do understand some situations are out of his control."
Ricoh,1dr37vbg90mci003,5.0,I highly recommend this company for those who are recent graduates who would like to get their foot in the door in a great company from the start.

Ricoh,1dqvguso852uj800,1.0,"Ricoh is a nightmare in terms of stress, work ethics, and demand. It is an exaample of how not to run a corporation. It's not organized and operates on favoritism. They continue to increase work load with no increase in pay."

Ricoh,1dq31clfib8be802,2.0,"I was excited to start something new, however, I was very disappointed. There is no training. I had to train myself and then, when I figured it all out, I then am training a 5th person, due to the fact, previous trainees quit and one was terminated. Their health insurance is horrible. Unattainable deductible even for the lowest priced plan. You are looking at close to, if not more than $200 per month for a single person with a $7,000 deductible annually, where you still have to pay 20% of all medical services. Not worth having an insurance card in my wallet to not be able to utilize it, while just giving the company money to which, you are not covered until you pay $7K annually before medical benefits kick-in. Very sad to work full-time for a company that does not pay (salary-wise) and cannot have medical coverage."
Ricoh,1dq0sebvfb8be802,1.0,"Poor leadership- Supervisor was absent most of the time. If she was there she was calling in two hours late everyday. Or giving directions via   face time. The job itself is fast paced, repetitive and challenging at times. Lack of communication between management and staff. makes uncertain working situations on the daily. They expect you to be a machine and not complain. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE FOR $13/hr. Keep looking, this place isn't worth your time or grief."

If you enjoy your sanity, this current batch (group of Managers)  is not worth working with, this type of cruel and rude treatment is a personality trait they outwardly reject but it's the first and only tool in the bag they reach for consistently,  Not to mention AZ. is an ""at will""  state so you can look forward to being dumped just because someone decided they didn't like you for some random reason, and they'll never tell you what it was, just .. buh bye."

Ricoh,1dotvm6q5h41i804,2.0,The company is more concerned with outdated policies then they are with customer satisfaction. Management has no clue of what they are doing. My typical day is driving all around the city and sometimes out of town to pick-up and deliver projects.

Ricoh,1doc8qp9hh45a800,2.0,"It has pretty good benefits if you are a FTE. Employees were encouraged to give their opinions, but they were ignored for the most part. It was impossible for me to advance my career. They kept promising advancement to me but did not deliver. Started to stagnate after 3 years, no new challenges after the three year mark. Almost impossible to make changes to ways of thinking and executions that have proven to be ineffective."
Ricoh,1dobp8lmp5j4j802,2.0,"Ricoh is very unorganized. Lack of moral within the company. Ricoh does not value their employees and sell a dream to their customers just to get the contract. They are very under staffed, yet constantly downsizing departments and even getting rid of needed departments. Management has meetings twice sometimes three times a week, but there is still no progress. For a company so big they seem to not have found their way in the industry to keep up with the competition."

Ricoh,1doa7ekasb8a6802,2.0,"They cant seem to identify their niche. Big market? Small market? Mid Market? Lay off a couple thousand people in the Spring and see what happens - every year. They change direction, comp plans, job titles,and keep the same executive leadership that cant seem to let a growth strategy gel and expect different results. We used to have a joke at Ricoh that if you didn't like the current version of Ricoh just wait and ""Imagine Change"" because it would be completely changed come springtime like clock work."

Ricoh,1dmmd3au4h3ot800,4.0,"Ricoh provides the training and tools needed to succeed.  Career advancement was always available.  Compensation/commission structure could use some improvement.  Overall, Ricoh has an amazing culture, however like many companies, they are always looking for areas to cut cost.  Unfortunately, Ricoh often times chooses to cut people in order to cut those costs, and not just people, but people that have the knowledge and experience. Ricoh's tagline of ""Imagine Change"" is very fitting.  Operations and processes are in a constant state of change, which can prove very challenging to the sales force.  Often times, these changes are implemented without the proper preparations completed first to ensure they are successful. Overall, my experience at Ricoh was a positive one."
Ricoh,1dmkia3nlb85r800,1.0,"Manager sits her office all day with her back facing towards the door. There's no training, you are literally thrown in the job with no training, then the manager tells you she didn't receive something in her in box because you didn't know how to do the paperwork, then she makes you feel like an idiot in front of other employees, which could care less about their jobs. No responsibility, documents come up missing all the time, including checks. Have to walk around on egg shells afraid to say anything to the other employees because there's favoritism, so you have to watch what you say. I witnessed many times where one employee would go out of his way to get information then twists it and brings it back to the manager.  She sits in her office all day so she needs a spy.  I take on too much responsibility because that's who I am, I care, I don't know how not too, most days I don't get a break but you can bet the others will get theirs, even when its 20 minutes before they clock out to go home.  Horrible working environment if you're a hard, responsible, caring employee like me. Look elsewhere."
Ricoh,1dmj1b15e5j6j800,3.0,"During 25 years and multiple mergers and acquisitions it was inconsistent. Sometimes very enjoyable and sometimes very unrewarding, depending upon management at the time.

Ricoh,1dlfuf7dn52sm800,1.0,"The very first day I was hired by this company the actual hiring manager told me about the assistant manager and one of the employees sleeping together. She constantly had drama stirring up between employees and kept people scared to stand up for themselves. She hired nothing but her older friends who picked on the younger employees and expressed jealousy. The benefits weren't that great in fact I ended up having an extra bill after one hospital trip and I've been working there for a 1 1/2. The higher ups were uncaring and although they knew who the issue was they refused to fix it. Instead they gave her a raise and a promotion. anybody from the age of 18-25 this place isn't for you this woman went through 5 young employees within the last couple of years and shes only been rewarded with a promotion. She has these deep "" caring"" convos in the supply closet where she pretends she cares tries to manipulate you into gossiping or becoming her squealer then once neither happens she works on your exit day by day. rumor by rumor. the convos are supposed to be professional and private SHE TELLS THE WHOLE OFFICE OF BUDDY HIRES. Not to mention the law firm (which were our clients) was in full out war with us. One employee continued to talk about my skinny weight and coarse hair. Instead of my manager having my back she sided with the woman just because she hated me. However she always fought for her buddy hires. This place is a joke. Lastly, my checks decreased monthly and we had one raise which was divided among the employees I never saw a penny. Don't believe me apply."

The culture is absolutely unethical, they ask you to do anything in order to make a number, because all the management is under pressure, since the company is in terrible financial standing. I am waiting to a right opportunity to leave this terrible work place, and will not recommend it to anyone. I foresee a terrible future in store for the company, and they continue to lay off personnel."
Ricoh,1dji1499b5j4n801,4.0,This industry is not for the faint of heart.  Hard work and determination are the keys to success.  If you can cut it here you can cut it anywhere! Good luck!
Ricoh,1djhfotjq5j4n800,4.0,"Good colleagues, good culture, good benefits,gratifying work, sometimes long hours, Good Management support. Opportunities for some training. .Not to much travel"
Ricoh,1djftju5jbrdd801,3.0,"The work was stressful but not overly so.  Mainly my issue was with management.  Our outfit was never supported the way it needed to be so we were constantly under the gun and seemed to be the whipping boy.  Any customer complaints, even they were unfounded or unavoidable, were brought down on me supervisor's head.  He left quickly after I was hired and his replacement was too passive to fight for himself.  It led to a miserable boss which trickled down to our team.  It got to the point where we went from 7 employees to 2 and never had a replacement hired, just a shifted workload and higher expectations."
Ricoh,1djf1sfuc5j4n800,2.0,"The office products industry is in transition, which affects the current strategic direction that the company is taking. This constant change of direction has created a very stressful workplace environment which resulted in making it very difficult to get things done on a regular basis."
Ricoh,1djcu3t1e5nea800,5.0,"The work culture is pretty fair, more independence if you get into the right job/career. Everyone worked well with each other to support the various needs."
Ricoh,1djcgas07h3h7800,3.0,"No job stability. A huge part of my department was laid off. Otherwise, while there it was good for work-life balance. Worked from home most of the time."
Ricoh,1djas1k8pbrdd800,3.0,"I would walk in in the mornings greet everyone,open up my computer look at everything that needed to be done for the day. I would then start ordering supplies, along with doing inventory on supplies we currently had on hand. after all that was done i would help my team with whatever they needed help with so we could finish everything in a timely matter."
Ricoh,1f5tc3ciqu3af800,3.0,"Ridiculous schedules, poor management and they all answer to the clueless execs in Japan. Leaders are only looking out for themselves and constantly leave the grunge work for the worker bees with zero appreciation."
Ricoh,1djam26cl24f0005,1.0,"VERY poor management skills, you are just a number, management does not stand behind their employees.  They were always trying to play ""got ya"".  Started at $17/per hour and 5 years later was at $17.56.  Was never put on a path for success.  This place will set you up for failure and had a ""good ole boys club"".  You will have to meet 76 different numbers on a metrics in order to get what little raise they will give."
Ricoh,1dj8ogi9kh3v0800,5.0,"My current position is very satisfying, I have had 3 great bosses at Ricoh."
Ricoh,1dj8hr4k2h3gh800,5.0,Great company to work for it was a pleasure working there.
Ricoh,1dj8a3bdjb8bm800,4.0,benefits and 401k are pretty good. paid vacation and sick time is good too. starting wages could be much better. their 6% contribution to your retirement fund is great.
Ricoh,1dj6ad2mu1d0n000,3.0,"My job was eliminated after just over a year working here. They closed the office in my town. When the CEO from Japan came in he got rid of over 1,000 people in my position."
Ricoh,1dj5i4v2mh46t802,5.0,Ricoh is a great company to work for.  They are professional and are fair and very supportive of their staff.  You work directly with the staff of the contract and everyone is very helpful.
Ricoh,1dj4t699n0mcg002,1.0,Ricoh doesn’t care about their employees and they make it known. They don’t care about anything but themselves. Fine for a started job but other than that it’s awful.
Ricoh,1dj4f7l9nh3v0800,3.0,"Interviewing at Ricoh almost made me not want to except the job offer when it came.  It was a panel interview and one of the managers was almost hostile in his way of questioning.  Fast forward a couple of years, and two of the managers on the panel are no longer with the company one (the abrasive Manager) was eventually terminated and another was forced into early retirement.  The layout of the office looks like the new world of work, but the mindset is clearly not. Many of the Managers management styles and way of thinking is still very antiquated and punitive. There are opportunities for advancement depending on your connections and getting a promotion does not secure your place in the company, as the company is currently forcing early retirement on employees, laying off those that don’t “opt in” and outsourcing, then closing departments; subsequently laying off those employees as well. I say keep searching if you’re looking for a ‘career.’ If you’re looking to learning and then move on, a ‘stop’ at Ricoh may benefit you. But enter at your own risk they’re clearly in financial trouble."
Ricoh,1dj2q0l7ah3v0800,1.0,"Not a customer or employee focused company at all. The toxic culture of IKON has infected the company. Not a good choice for a long term career. Excellent equipment, but a toxic, anti customer corporate culture."
Ricoh,1divlc9ehh43c800,4.0,"Ricoh is a very nice company to work for, management doesn’t breathe down your neck every second and you are largely left alone. There is a lot of accountability as my boss lives in a different town and I maybe see my boss once a month if that. As an FSR you will probably be on the road a lot traveling to different sites. You are responsible for being at the right site at the right time. Most sites I visit are pretty slow. So there is a lot of downtime."
Ricoh,1ditv67p8h46t801,1.0,Ricoh is a company downsizing and eliminating entire departments by outsourcing the jobs to a foreign country. Senior Management does it's best to side with the company you are being outsourced to.
Ricoh,1dite6841h43c800,5.0,My day would consist of floating around from department to department and reliving my co-workers from their duty so they could get help. The two department I worked in were reception and logistics. Which gave a ton of office experience.
Ricoh,1ditbcv57h46t802,2.0,Okay place to work . No work life balance. Work is stressful. Management seems out of touch with workers. Poor compensation. A lot of work for little pay
Ricoh,1dita73jjbrcm802,4.0,The job is fine. Not much of an opportunity to grow within the company so it's perfect if you're cool with that. You don't make a lot but you don't really do much so it balances itself out.
Ricoh,1disvq0l31d0n002,2.0,"When i first started to work there it was great but after being there for a year i learned with this company. They do not give good raises per year,doing more than just your job, not get paid enough for the amount of work they give you, no bonuses, they are very weird when it comes to paying you for mileage if you had to drive to another site, don't show appreciation to their staff as much as they should unless your higher up and overall they do not pay you as much as your worth working there."
Ricoh,1disug1m15ndc800,5.0,"Ricoh is a special company that really emphasizes on helping their employees grow professionally. They have a learning platform that helps you become more professional. Need help giving better customer support, Ricoh can help. Need help becoming a leader or even in management, Ricoh's got you covered. Even in technical aspects, Ricoh helps their employees not only learn new things, but excel in them."
Ricoh,1dispouith3n0802,1.0,not a place for someone looking to be in IT. this is more customer service. no growth for IT positions. been with the company for years and haven't done anything useful.
Ricoh,1diqcj82ubrcm802,4.0,"Worked with some great people, pay was good, as well as benefits.  Work hours were long especially during month end close process.  The company offered flex work schedules and casual dress code."
Ricoh,1dip4jf6ph46t800,1.0,The title says it all. 3 years without a raise. Shuffled from one position to another with a complete lack of training. Held accountable for the mistakes of others. Physically threatened and verbally abused. A culture of blame and fear. Don't do it. For the love of God just don't.
Ricoh,1diojhh92h43c800,5.0,I have a good relationship with upper management.  I enjoy working with the many different people I encounter each day at the job sites.  The hardest part is traveling all day to different job sites.  The culture is very comfortable.  I can contact my manager at any time and feel that he will respond to my questions and needs.
Ricoh,1f5tc3ciqu3af800,3.0,"Ridiculous schedules, poor management and they all answer to the clueless execs in Japan. Leaders are only looking out for themselves and constantly leave the grunge work for the worker bees with zero appreciation."

Ricoh,1dinra2i81d0n002,4.0,raises are SO hard to get. If you choose to work here make sure you are being compensated correctly. Thats the only advice i can really give. Also free lunch
Ricoh,1dik47kgd5ncu800,3.0,Strong work environment. Many daily opportunities to gain further experience. Career advancement opportunities. Co-workers that genuinely care about you.
Ricoh,1dihf2046h3mq800,1.0,Management & anyone training in the Arkansas chapter are lunatics to put it nicely. I couldn't believe the chaotic disaster that I hired into! Management via B.H. was more closely related to constant terrorizing of the employees. Extreme gaslighting & narcissistic behavior & patterns of constant attempts at manipulating employees under him. Awful company to work for & the equipment we were assigned was terribly faulty. I wouldn't recommend this company to ANYONE!
Ricoh,1diehj5gvh3ur802,2.0,"I worked here for ten years. I processed mail for TD Ameritrade. I endured the process of the TD Waterhouse/Ameritrade merger. They brought in a TD Waterhouse employee to train us to take his job. Needless to say, we were not trained well. We did survive and thrived once we got it all figured out. In the ten years I worked there, I went three years without a raise. Twice because of the economy and once because a tsunami struck in Japan and hit Ricoh's headquarters. At least, that's what they TOLD us. If you're in a pinch and don't mind getting to work in the wee hours of the morning, it's an okay job. The work keeps you busy. You'll have to work some Saturdays as well, but you do get a day off in the middle of the week."
Ricoh,1die7bltrh435802,2.0,"Raises are on par with fast food joints and Big box stores. You'll get your raise about 6 months after your review. Upper management are basically leaches on the hard working blue collar employees. If there's an incentive for lower employees, upper management cashes in too even though they had nothing to do with the actual work put in to gain the incentive. Upper management can be very pompous, cold and uptight. It's a job. You are paid at poverty level and when review time comes around they tell you how poorly the company did last quarter, so you'll accept the bottom of the barrel .15 cent raise. It takes an act of Congress for them to follow through with anything. They don't like to fire people. So, you will be expected take up the slack for lazy unethical employees, even if they make more than you. Just look for another company to work for."
Ricoh,1di8ss3tnh3ui801,2.0,Not a great place for advancement... unless you’re already at an advanced level.been in the same position for years — no upward mobility in pay or degree of difficulty. Underemployed.
Ricoh,1di71c4gdh3qc800,3.0,"Most of the successful people that I met there were rather a**l retentive, afraid to express themselves. Although upper management touts being innovative, being innovative is discouraged by the majority of managers (mostly ""yes"" people).  That sense of someone watching over your shoulder, or feeling of paranoia may not be imagined.  It's all about the numbers, despite the denials.  Good luck."
Ricoh,1di66541r52so800,4.0,Ricoh is a place with constant changes. Ricoh gives you a lot of training and tuition reimbursement which will help if you want to pursue your education. Good place to work
Ricoh,1di4bomji5j6o800,3.0,Theu didnt care about their employees. worked 7 days a week and never wanted to pay the hardworking ones. They took advantage of the good employees. mangers were so disrespectful  and rude when you talked to them

Ricoh,1dhuvc4uah42n803,1.0,Management is terrible and people are not held accountable for corporate policies and procedures. Human resources in this company is a joke. You will never have opportunites for advancement and they will replace you in a week. They also do not tolerate people of different backgrounds or disabilities.
Ricoh,1dhu1m61t5j6o800,1.0,"There is no way I would work at this location until there is a change in the Market Place VP / Managing Director. You will spend all day going through CYA Drills per his direction, instead of focusing on the required tasks. The only good thing I can say is if it wasn't for the Area's Operations Leadership, this Unit would have been desimated."
Ricoh,1dhrh7uvkh3js800,4.0,Good company but looking for better pay. Part of a great team. Interacted daily with managers and teammates. Travel was a little far though.  I'm looking for a better paying job and better location.
Ricoh,1dhqhi0k6h3mb801,1.0,"I will never work for Ricoh again, unless I want to be put in my grave from abuse and harassment.   The more you  talk to higher management about the problem the more they treat you like dirt."
Ricoh,1dhq4tvsk5j6o801,1.0,I would not recommend anyone there . The manager don't care about his employees just himself and always criticizing us knowing that none us been there for a year. We do all the work with not enough training for him to come and blame everything on us is so wrong.

Ricoh,1dhknb90ch3tp800,2.0,Be careful and research this business from top-to-bottom before going all in. It felt like we were always struggling to make an impact - due in part to how hard it was get leadership to listen to ideas.

Ricoh,1dhfca23hb82g800,1.0,All i can write is those two guys need to go to management classes. They need undercover to know what these two guys are doing. 3 of us worked very hard but need to have 4 workers.
Ricoh,1dh7b1m15b82g804,4.0,Ricoh is a good company to work for. However my manager at the time was to busy with other accounts and people that I felt like I was not able to develop and grow.
Ricoh,1dh76katoh420800,2.0,"This a contracting side of Ricoh. They call it"" managed services"". They contract you out to a list of companies to do Reception and mail room duties. I work for a big manufacturing company doing reception. The company i work for ignores you unless they need something. The executive staff is horribly rude. I was lied to about the amount of work and how busy it is supposed to be. They just hire to fill in warm bodies. I would NOT recommend them to anyone to work for."
Ricoh,1dh70bbeoh3j2800,4.0,This company was the first that I worked for when I arrived in GA.  It is a good company to work for. And the staff in amazing.  I am glad I got this experience.

Ricoh,1dh5vcfh2breq800,3.0,Job was easy loved working there but got let go because apparently we aren't allowed to have two jobs which I have never heard of in my entire life management doesn't speak but if they did it wasn't a polite time always sound so rude and workers were really awesome there that's for sure some were playing favoritism which isn't common it's like that everywhere and also you wouldn't be permanent til after a year
Ricoh,1dh5f3gmeh3j2800,2.0,I can say that management is totally out of touch and has no idea how to move forward.  Don’t know how this company will grow profits when technology advances so quickly and ricoh is stuck using dead technology and has 0 innovation.

Ricoh,1dh1leqolb826800,4.0,Career advancement is dependent upon who your manager is.  They want to keep you down so that you won't leave. Co-Workers were great though. You must find fulfillment through working with the client on projects but then remember that you're not actually apart of the team.
Ricoh,1dgpeq0k4h3t1800,3.0,Diagnosing and repairing copiers and printers. Upgrading firmware and java. Teamwork. If I can't figure something out the other Techs offer there experience.

Ricoh,1dga8onca5j4j800,4.0,I would still be working there if the company didn't downsize. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a great group of people. Management was great and training was always available.
Ricoh,1dg9gvrt95ncl800,1.0,To much bullying by coworkers and lead floor mental abuse in every department 30 min lunch breaks and 1 10 min. Break more like 7-8 because they time you from the time they take over ur machine then if you are a min. Late you get fussed out
Ricoh,1dg90afuv52sp803,2.0,Company is closing and laying off Departments one by one. Moved corporate to Atlanta and many people lost there jobs.  They should have given people the truth before they new they would be losing job.
Ricoh,1dg6h2na9brcm800,4.0,My site manager was pretty great. The company itself is okay but just depends on how your site is. Heard the other sites are pretty relaxed as well unless you're in sales.

Ricoh,1dg403u6cb84k800,2.0,"Extremely corporate atmosphere. Company likes to make you think you're part of a family, but unless you choose to advance up the ladder, you're just another cog in the machine. Hard work and diligence to your job position is not shown on your paycheck. Raises were never significant, and sometimes were never given. No cost of living increases. Mandatory training that had zero relation to your current job position was often required, and was a distraction from your daily responsibilities. Managers were often just pencil pushers that stayed in the back office all day and chose to ignore issues and concerns on the floor. Upper management was usually clueless to how the site was really running, and the workers who invested their time and energy exhaustively were hardly recognized for their efforts."
Ricoh,1dg32c34mb80v800,1.0,"Terrible upper management, always speak of progression in the company but don't produce results to match what they say.

Ricoh,1dg2r4qt324ef000,4.0,Ricoh is more about the Company. They have training online. You do have flexibility of moving to different location throughout the country. The only way to make a suitable income is to be in an upper management position. You can grow into those areas by doing the training and working toward your goals. They have great benefits as well as vacation and floating holidays as well as regular holiday pay.

Ricoh,1dfhj03j71d0h001,1.0,"Do not trust this company. They do not care about long time employees. They will use you and then toss you aside! There is FAR TOO MUCH executive management, outsourcing to foreign countries for cheap labor, and politics. Run...don't walk!"
Ricoh,1dffh6obn24fh000,1.0,Treat you like a servant down and dirty work add to your job description constantly and given no choice to reject the added job ie cleaning the office gym that was the straw that broke the camel's back for me.  Unfairness with coworkers you had lazy ones riding on the coattails of the hardworking ones there was no reward for being exceptional.  Started off full of positivity left a shell of a person beaten down by negativity
Ricoh,1dff2n9pf1d01000,3.0,Lot of things to accomplish daily to maintain company guidelines and make sales goals. Laptops used for job were old and dated. You had to clear history  continually and laptop batteries would not hold charge .

Ricoh doesn't have a good HR process, people there are good, but upper HR is by phone.  RICOH Japan believes the copier biz is good in the states as the VP's that are there would buy smaller dot Coms and leverage their gains against Ricoh's losses.   RICOH Dosent trust its employees.   Don't expect any level of management to tell the truth."
Ricoh,1dfebeuin24e1000,2.0,Management sucks.  Too much “good cop/bad cop.” Way too much favoritism! People were cool. They under bid contracts so the don’t pay the employees for the true value of their work they perform.
Ricoh,1dfdkrqmg0mt1000,1.0,"This place is the most horrible place to work, if you like being micromanaged then this is the place for you.

Ricoh,1dfbbf20p5nbk800,1.0,Seems to be constant changes.  No clear direction for the company at this time.  Morale is very low right now due to all of the changes and a lack of direction.

Ricoh,1df15al2gh3m0800,4.0,Challenging at times but excellant work schedule. Good benefits.  Break times not always possible due to user interface.  Daily functions can vary based on the needs of the customer.
Ricoh,1depr2h9dh45l800,5.0,"Ricoh provided a great blank canvas for personal development and the support received from mentors and co-workers translates into an ability to pay it forward when others need a leg up.  The company, like many others, is in transition from old style manufacturing and logistics to a services-led model that seeks to break out of the pack and lead in new directions in new emerging markets. Chaotic at times sure, but disruption is the new normal and suits the nimble."
Ricoh,1deo163a65n9t800,3.0,"You don't really learn any applicable life skills outside of a copy center/mailroom functions. It's something that I took to try something new. Coworker can be dull, and the places you work at don't seem to care about your existence either."
Ricoh,1denbprh9h3h3800,4.0,I enjoyed the work and the training they offered. My only complaint is they pay less than a livable wage and you tend to work for highly trained professionals which can lead to strained relationships with the client. Not for everyone or the clinically depressed lol
Ricoh,1dea9aig8h414803,5.0,Am very happy to worked Multi National Company and this  my second MNC company. Well organised company. First year weeks paid leave and sick leaves also.
Ricoh,1de8f964tb8bt800,5.0,Fun new experience with a very diverse company. So many opportunities to grow and really develop your skills. One of the most amazing things about this company is there willingness to help pay your tuition.
Ricoh,1de82a6grh44u800,2.0,Ricoh has fallen on hard times and it shows in the culture and the moral of employees.  What was once a great place to work is no longer.  No one feels secure at least in my area
Ricoh,1de7s8181h414801,1.0,"If you want to be promoted, better start kissing the back-side of your management team, otherwise you will go nowhere. This company only cares about the bottom line, not its employees. Their raises are beyond pathetic. They says 3% if you do well on your reviews. Not true. I received all high marks, and still got 1% raise. Management did all they could to undermine you. They gave you some independence, so they say, but immediately turned on you if they do not approve, and made you look bad in front of the client."
Ricoh,1de5a29k352u8800,3.0,Ricoh  for the most part has been a good company to work for.  They are a competitive company and provide opportunities for growth within the company. There are some issues with management as it is with many companies.
Ricoh,1de50cihuh3p9800,3.0,Has potential but not a lot of room for advancement. Management has a lot of room to grow and communication could be better. Vacation and benefits are a good thing!
Ricoh,1de4uq0alh3p9800,4.0,Great company to work for.
Ricoh,1de4tsuk5h3l5800,4.0,"The company seems legit. However, there are people who are very unprofessional at work, and they seem like they would allow it. I was let go of a personal matter. I am a Vet, and I have disabilities. However, they did what they wanted anyway. I can not believe they treated me like this. I will never work for companies like this."
Ricoh,1de3kq1msh3oq800,4.0,"This is a fast paced working environment where you interact with attorneys, secretaries, & paralegals of both firms-Balch & Bingham and Burr & Foreman, LLP."
Ricoh,1f5tc3ciqu3af800,3.0,"Ridiculous schedules, poor management and they all answer to the clueless execs in Japan. Leaders are only looking out for themselves and constantly leave the grunge work for the worker bees with zero appreciation."
Ricoh,1ddu2h11qh3oq800,4.0,"Ricoh is a great company start with if you are looking for full-time employment, with benefits, and healthcare. When I first started at Ricoh, I was an office assistant. If you are hired as an office assistant, you are placed at a client site. The client, you are under their contract and follow the client’s holiday schedule and rules for being in the client’s office. You are paid for site holidays, holidays, vacations, power outages, inclement weather. Also, you do everything that is required of you in that contract. With Ricoh you are able to stay full time even if that contract is up. Ricoh has other client locations if you want to relocate or even become an FSR. If you’ve been their for sometime they may extend that offer to you. Then you can become a field service representative and work at multiple locations. You can work at IT companies, marketing companies, law firms, consumer product companies, and more. Depending on the location you may be printing documents for lawyers, sorting mail, designing logos, headquarters receptionist, printing, creating gbc books, spiral, posters. As an FSR, you will be paid mileage in addition to your hourly salary. The salary of an FSR is better than an office assistant because of mileage. You cover at locations and have many coworkers you see. If you’re far from a location you can tell your manager not to send you there. Instead cover at client sites 10min - 1 hour away from you. With my hourly pay and mileage I am happy. However, I feel I can do much better. As I studied art and design and it being a printing company unfortunately, it"
Ricoh,1ddtk6uecb83o800,4.0,"I loved the autonomy of working at different locations everyday, meeting new people and rarely being stuck behind a desk. Management gave me the trust I needed to do a good job without looking over my shoulder constantly."
Ricoh,1ddrufffs5n91800,5.0,"Is a very good place to work every one is ready to help, every one is responsible, Safety Conscious, Dependable, reliable and caring people, good atmosphere"
Ricoh,1ddr1mhl6h3kl800,3.0,"A work day consists of getting orders audited, entered and booked. Answering emails, sending emails for revisions and handling customer disputes and needs. Management for the most part was always hands on and available when needed. The workplace environment was always busy and stressful at times but the moral within the business was always great to keep going. There was not really a hard part other than keeping up with all that was needed to stay ahead of things. I enjoyed mostly the moral and company surrounding which made my job enjoyable."
Ricoh,1ddqi8tfhh44g800,4.0,it's ok to work here .im just tying too move on.
Ricoh,1ddostrvpb85e801,5.0,Ricoh was not just my second home but also the place where I learn so many things.
Ricoh,1ddlr4v6b24e0000,3.0,"Clean and quiet atmosphere. Very customer-oriented.  Great training programs and decent benefits. Game room, quiet room and frequent employee morale events."
Ricoh,1ddlj56ss24gh000,3.0,"I worked here for just over 1 year and it wasnt too bad. The main issue I had was with management. The contracted manager would tell us to do one thing, and the Ricoh manager would tell us to do the complete opposite. In fact, within Ricoh itself I felt there were too many levels of management and the communication wasnt very good. There were decent benefits tho, free gym and on occasion free lunches as a reward for our good work.  I did feel valued as an employee (was told my work was good) I just felt like because I was contracted I had no job security which was true. Also the pay was quite low for a position which required a bachelor's degree. I was making the same with a high school diploma. However, the staff were all nice and professional."
Ricoh,1ddjlutfpb835800,2.0,"As an FSR, I have been to different location from the most boring location to the busiest location. Very little motivation or incentives. The company seems to be more toward saving most at the cost of quality employees."
Ricoh,1ddj8kv3p24gh000,4.0,I lived the segmented teams. I worked health related accounts. Management cares about developing employees. The leadership team has 4 awesome folks! Lots of contests that they get involved in. Such as wearing silly costumes themed to the contest.
Ricoh,1ddeublg3h3j5800,5.0,"Overall, it really depends on the site you are applying to work for. It can be amazing, or a train wreck. Many of my friends are FSRs (work at numerous sites as needed for coverage) and nothing is consistent from site-to-site. The site I worked at was well run, with great corporate clients who appreciated the work we did. My direct supervisor as well as my IAM (essentially a district manager) were amazing people to work with."
Ricoh,1dd67cva35j6t800,5.0,So many opportunities to move up or even from city to city. Times are always changing and Ricoh is embracing the change by changing along with the times.
Ricoh,1dd60lc8m5j6t800,2.0,Competition like feel in a hostile workplace where management forces sales rather than encourages. No sense of help or responsibility from management.
Ricoh,1dd3cog7rh3ih800,2.0,"The company itself is very great but it is truly the management oh, the management team is usually made up of guys who have never worked the entry level positions. At times things can get really slow and managers who have no work for you become upset with employees. Pay is low in comparison to what you do ,you can go from hardware based assignments , networking Amazon technologies,etc. You basically utilize all skills here that those fancy cert test say you need. The workforce at Ricoh is talented but compensated low. Overall the managers make it unbearable at times."
Ricoh,1dd1t3g00h3ql802,1.0,Misleading leadership. Unfair wages. Ask too much for too little.
Ricoh,1dd1ll7su5j6l800,1.0,"I am still employed with Ricoh and I’ll be so happy when I’m not.  The managers micro-manage you to death.  The pay is measly, but it’s nice to earn PTO after less than 30 days of employment.  Managers spy on you but can’t even give a “good morning” most days"
Ricoh,1dd0rpacth3mg800,2.0,The starting pay is low and below poverty for a print and mail clerk but advancement can pay well from what I hear.  Great benefits somewhat affordable.  They put me into an acting manager role without asking me or telling me and then had me figure out monthly reports on my own with lack of training or resources.
Ricoh,1dcv48vl55j60800,3.0,"Can be a great place to work under the right manager. I learned a great deal at this company and increased in knowledge a great deal. Under some of the better personnel, I was able to flourish in my roles. But as things change then often times so does the comfort ability of the place. All in all, I enjoyed my time and found some great life long friends in the process."
Ricoh,1dcu5vr1o5nea800,4.0,Ricoh is good company.
Ricoh,1dcrhm8rfh41t800,3.0,Executive management changes direction much to often.  Many layoffs over the past two years.  Focus changed a lot.  I am not sure what else to say about this company.

Ricoh,1dcor061d5nea800,4.0,Good place to work. Took care of it's people and family balance. Good manager and mentors. Supervisors worked with each other. Had great benefits and great workers.
Ricoh,1dcnmv4m6h3lt800,4.0,"Place was ok to work in, initially bland but in recent years there have been efforts to liven up the place a bit. Lots of inovation in the building in recent years."
Ricoh,1dcmnevish3hu800,5.0,"Ricoh is a great company to work for, but tend to be unfair when it comes to wages. I love my job but dislike the pay enough to go out job hunting. :/"
Ricoh,1dcho700ph3q1800,5.0,"Ricoh was a great experience for me. I was promoted to manager in after a year of employment. If i wanted to change the department that I work for, trainning was provided."
Ricoh,1dchlm46ah41q800,4.0,"I like building relationships with my customers, and really getting to know every aspect of their business---from their mission statement, work culture, and strategizing what I can do to help their business grow with the goods and services that I have to offer."
Ricoh,1dchdek24brem800,1.0,Low pay a awful management played favorites  with certain  employees.
Ricoh,1dcgaa6mtbref800,4.0,"I worked for several divisions of Ricoh over the course of 35 years.  Ricoh, as most large global companies, had ups and downs, and always change driven.  Overall the company was a good company, but much depended on what specific division or assignment you might be in at any given time.  Flux in management kept targets moving, and policies, focus, and pay structure were continuously changing....sapping energy from the workforce that could have been directed towards securing business."
Ricoh,1dcf3r4dth3pr800,4.0,I loved working at Ricoh benefits where good pay was okay but got laid off after 15 years. I missed 3 lay offs working for Ricoh. They appreciated hard work.
Ricoh,1dc9knmuvbrd9800,4.0,The work is not mysterious and it is steady - but also not glamorous .
Ricoh,1dc7sv5cqh44m800,3.0,It was an ever changing position. Was laid off after almost   years with company. They closed call center & moved all jobs to GA & I was not willing to relocate
Ricoh,1dc7b6j5jb858800,3.0,"It's ok for a call center but the business is changing too slowly for a dying industry. Advancement is possible depending on who you know, not what you know."
Ricoh,1dc5h6c8t5n8h800,4.0,I have worked at Ricoh for over a decade. Great sense of stability but  sometimes upper management focuses on things that seem to divide the team as a whole.
Ricoh,1dc582utqb81c800,3.0,I have enjoyed working at this company but upper management has done a poor job running the business.  The last few years they've had a significant amount of layoffs.  There was a time this was a fun competitive place to work.  If things don't change soon most of their business will be managed through dealer channels.
Ricoh,1dc51ud8r5n8h800,2.0,"For those who like this industry, it may be a good fit for you.  I found that the culture was not modern and the leadership was not able to manage high performance employees who were innovative in their thinking."
Ricoh,1dc4tpelqb81c800,5.0,"I loved working here, I would have never left if they didn't hire this new girl that had everything negative and bad to say about everything. Other than that really no advancements, but you are automatically permanent here so this place has great job security. You are only working with 4 or 5 other people and that's it. Great and easy job."
Ricoh,1dc4pq3tjb895800,3.0,I would never work for ricoh usa again they will fire you at a drop of a dime. You'll never know what to expect for management one day your here and the next day your gone.
Ricoh,1dc284d0e24fe000,3.0,Company doesn't offer adequate support/ or accommodations for expecting mothers. I practically begged for help at my site and was not offer any (even though I submitted all the paperwork they asked for) until AFTER I got injured at work WHILE PREGNANT. They should also improve their maternity leave benefits. Don't get pregnant while working for this company. There is also very little room for growth here.
Ricoh,1dc25lsh524fe001,4.0,"Felt valued as a sales professional.  Given opportunities for career advancement and training.  Work culture, support and co-workers were fantastic.  Definitely a changing industry that is trying to get more into the tech space.  Not sure what the future holds."
Ricoh,1dbtmrq3jb88l800,3.0,"Ricoh is a place where you work on site as a vendor offering contracted services to your customer. Like any job there is opportunity there is room for advancement, but if you find a boss who will not stand up for there employees you will have problems. I had three raises in my time and was thrown into a situation with no training only to uncover poor ethical choices made by my superior."
Ricoh,1f5tc3ciqu3af800,3.0,"Ridiculous schedules, poor management and they all answer to the clueless execs in Japan. Leaders are only looking out for themselves and constantly leave the grunge work for the worker bees with zero appreciation."
Ricoh,1dbti295lb88l800,5.0,Ricoh Americas Corporation is a great place to work.  I would recommend working at Ricoh to anyone who asks. Work life balance is not a problem and Ricoh gives you every chance to succeed.
Ricoh,1dbtev2bgb88l800,3.0,"FSR's are required to do a lot of travel working within the city. This position is great if you want to gain some exposure and experience within some of the largest companies around. We have contracts with Nike, Adidas, and Amazon to name a few. It's nice to see a glimpse of how these companies operate. Your work will not always go appreciated, but the experience itself feels rewarding."
Ricoh,1dbs5if7rb84n800,1.0,"Local management was okay but Regional (Phoenix office) was terrible.  The lowest pay in the industry and it really shows.  I do recommend Canon Solution Americas,"
Ricoh,1dbm725qjb88l802,5.0,"Great atmosphere, at least on the team I was on. I had two managers both were outstanding. Wasn't very stressful outside of the commute. Spend all day on the road in the field."
Ricoh,1dbm2553624f9000,3.0,"I loved working at Ricoh. What I didn't love is that every year for the four years I worked there, there were MAJOR restructures that affected A LOT of people. Upper management changed every year and it would take them about six months to restructure the marketing communications teams. My entire department (1,000 people +) was let go this year. I actually made it through every other restructure but this last one. So if you want to work somewhere where you can basically count on being let go, this is the place for you. It's just a matter of when. The company has been unable to rebrand itself to being a services and solutions company and so it is constantly loosing money, which makes it a dicey working situation."
Ricoh,1dbjaucn324eo000,4.0,"It is an interesting company, great place to learn but upper management have poor judgment and play as politician. Great workplace culture and friendly environment."
Ricoh,1dbe24qkd1d13000,5.0,"It's never the same.  Everyday there is something different.  Making posters, flyers, business cards or just exams.  I have a lot of fun and really enjoy most of the people I work with."
Ricoh,1dbbq2p8a5j5f802,1.0,Strategic direction from leadership rarely lasted more than a year. Constant worry about layoffs due to multiple reorgs. Some of the most talented hard working people I have ever had the pleasure to work with.
Ricoh,1dbbq02cs24gi000,1.0,"Ricoh is losing contracts so they are constantly letting people go. They have you leave early every day sometimes you only work 4 hours- your at risk of losing benefits. Management is inconsistent and retaliatory. Promise raises to keep people on, but then don't deliver."
Ricoh,1db9mj0od24g2000,5.0,Was with the company for 20+ years they offered much in the way of training.  If you wanted opportunity and challenge they offered it.  While much of the Houston call center was released due to changes within the company I owe this company so much for all they did for me.  I wish them well and continue to wish them all the success.
Ricoh,1db5lm2hd24e3000,4.0,Ricoh can be a good company to work for. There are many opportunities for growth but depending on which division of the company you're in will decide where you may have the most opportunities. I have had the opportunity to grow from within.
Ricoh,1db1utqb824fj000,4.0,"I really enjoy the travelling part of the job. I enjoy working overtime in the copy center, travelling to different cities in South Carolina, overtime pay as well"
Ricoh,1db1b8lih52tk800,1.0,"Great technology, horrible support system.  Sales position  had little to no commission,  unattainable goals, poor salary rate."
Ricoh,1daufbv6j52te800,5.0,Good company to work for. Great Benefits. If you enjoy working in the legal department Ricoh is contracted by the best Law Firms. Your hands on with Secretaries and lawyers
Ricoh,1dauaf5o652te800,1.0,Not a good place to work.  Was given a terrible salary right out of school and took this as my first position.  Switched managers on me immediately after starting.  Not a good environment.
Ricoh,1dau1nua252te800,3.0,"Ricoh is an excellent place to work, there is a lot of changes going on, but it is a good company, with a great family balance.  I travel about every six weeks, mostly international.  When I was home, I was either finishing reviewing an audit and preparing for other audits."
Ricoh,1darth9u4b868800,1.0,Management was horrible. The only good thing about the job was you were working by yourself most of the day. I would not recommend anybody work for Ricoh!!!
Ricoh,1daovl2v9h41o800,5.0,"I was very young working at RICOH and was only a mail room clerk, but the job was cool. Didn't really do much throughout the course of a day except for deliver mail through the building."
Ricoh,1daot7bgsbre0800,4.0,Work with bindery machinery. Print jobs. Ship out product. Mail runs on campus. Daily operations go pretty smooth usually. Work load is heavy sometimes but does help the day pass.
Ricoh,1daoqd92ub862800,3.0,Good place to start a office entry type of environment. Learn legal  software used on a daily basis. Learn to solve client demands and acclimate to client based culture. Learn to multi-task and solve complicated tasks at the clients request. Learn regularly used programs in a wide used legal environment.

Ricoh,1dacoicbj5nd5800,1.0,I work for Ricoh for 3 months I was promised the position and a new manager came on site and decided that he didn't want to hire me but I was promised before he even came never missed a day of work always was on time I was back from lunch on time just a great employee so I don't like to be lied to or promised a job. And now that I look back you still got the same position open so that tells me that the company is not right and my job for Richo ended December 2018 and today's date is 05/08/2019. As a event specialist you still have this job posteda and how many months has been see this company is not right and it should be a law against people like this that have people to get them caught up with work and then say the contract has ended that's not good....
Ricoh,1dac93g3hbrdf800,1.0,"Job stability has been an issue for many, many years now.  The continuous lay-offs over the years has employee morale extremely low.  There really isn't any morale left."
Ricoh,1da3ujduo5j4j800,1.0,"Most boring job I ever been to, it’s very fast paced you keep scanning for straight 8 hours it was just bad the environment is ok but the job itself was just boring s nonstop job until you leave work, the best thing I liked about was the pay but I was working for agency. That pays me good not Ricoh to be Ricoh employee they will pay you $12 and to be honest the pay doesn’t match the work load you do all day just insane it was not for me and I felt weird among everyone there I guess because i was the only educated person there win people that don’t even have high school diploma so it was not the right place for me to be at not for me might be for other people but so far I was counting every minute to go home which bad"
Ricoh,1d9m5pqsk5j4j800,2.0,Managers will always find something to question or complain about your work
Ricoh,1d9kli1iph3p4800,2.0,"Japanese owned company whose pricing models often makes sales difficult. I managed a sales team and my bosses told me to tell my sales people and new hires this was a $100K per year job when in reality its a $35-40K per year job at best. I was given tasks with time limits to accomplish them and then the time would be shortened drastically. When the tasks were not completed inder the new time constraints, I was written up and counseled. After 1 year of trying to be honest with my sales people and figuring out what this company wanted with its ever-shifting priorities, I moved on. The benefits were okay, the salary was fine, the managers and company culture is awful."
Ricoh,1d98inrq4h40q800,4.0,Ricoh provides a good opportunity to learn multiple skills in the normal performance of your job.  The company encourages employees to consider alternative to complete tasks more efficiently.
Ricoh,1d96hhc1mh40q800,3.0,"The work is relatively easy, the locations you work at vary from casual to business casual. All-in-all, it's not a bad job for beginners, but not the greatest for those looking to advance."

Ricoh,1d8jd4eqo0mte000,2.0,"Every time new execs are brought in, the entire direction of the company, the marketing strategies, etc. changes. Lays off large numbers of employees at least twice yearly. Many layers of management before anything can get done."

Lots of client interaction, making sure jobs were satisfactory, addressing issues, carefully executing the project and checking for flaws.  Travel and manual labor in delivery involved.  Team effort often a part of projects which was really fun.  Traveling by foot and car throughout the city and surrounding counties was enjoyable."
Ricoh,1d7v1e76hb80i800,4.0,On a daily basis I would deliver and install ink toners. I worked at a on-site location office and would travel to all surrounding clinics and hospitals that used our equipment. I would perform basic troubleshooting and light technician work to equipment.
Ricoh,1d7o6g3l05j55800,2.0,Its difficult to assume someone's job and have the other remaining employees fully accept you. But after an initial time period they all begin to realize Ricoh management is a dishonest and incompetent group and you establish a bond with the client against them.

Ricoh,1d7l7pfsj1d1c000,2.0,Management needs an upgrade. It is very hard to move up the latter and get promoted. There can be a lot of unnecessary drama. They ask for you to do a lot of things that aren't part of your job description and it's really hard to get a raise.

Ricoh,1d5qc3a49as0j800,2.0,"The Director of Accounting is a boss, not a leader.  He gives orders, but little guidance.  He knows accounting but cannot build relationship with those that work for him.  There is very low employee morale.  People come to work for him for the pay but there is little enthusiasm for the most part.  He is not approachable even though he thinks he sits in his office and answers questions means approachable.  He has unfriendly demeanor and gives short answers.  He get irritated when people don't understand his response."

Ricoh,1d52uu66a1ah2000,4.0,Each year there has been turnover that effects the go-to-market strategy on fulfilling market needs because there is either a loss of intellectual property and skills or a lack of commitment to the company mission.  It changes yearly rather than giving a glide path of 3 to 5 years to see the efforts come to fruition.

Ricoh,1d4lof0iv5nd0800,2.0,I was in the managed serviced dept meaning I managed a service for a client.  I had a lot of freedom in that regard.  You often felt like you worked for 2 companies (both RICOH and the client)  and had twice the amount of work to be done.  If you requested help or said anything they would send a helper to your site but they would often be poor quality.  60% of my helpers were not allowed back due to behavioral problems.
Ricoh,1d4j3ll1ibrct800,4.0,"Looked forward to different challenges each day working as a facilities manager.

Ricoh,1d464uuu1b84q800,2.0,"One phrase comes to mind: Bait & Switch. They'll make you think you are going to be and pay you as a 1st tier responder.

Ricoh,1d34vlk73akcg800,5.0,"Ricoh is a company that will invest in your career.  They provide you all the tools you need to succeed, you just need to let your manager know where you want to go in the organization.

Ricoh,1d2kuq6rq1bg7000,3.0,"Poor management took all the fun out of working for them. I like working on the machines, but they want everyone to be a salesman. Managers work off a spreadsheet of numbers, instead of talking to the customers."
Ricoh,1d2j96oor1fdl000,2.0,"The Area Director lies and is a complete bully.  She only watches out for herself, does not follow policies unless it benefits her, and fails her immediate staff often.  Unfortunately, Ricoh is about money.  They lie to keep accounts, pay nothing to employees but, expect the same employees to stay with them and be loyal.  Raises were 1%-2% for 2018.  If you expect a career or good money working for Ricoh, look elsewhere.  This company is a joke!"

Ricoh,1d2ia9cro1d0m001,5.0,Working at Ricoh for almost 15 years was a very pleasurable experience. Rico provided a quiet room a game room and a lounge where you could get to know your coworkers. As with any cost center Rico was very fast pace with things changing from minute to minute so you had to be a quick thinker and be able to work without supervision to reach to go that was sent by management.
Ricoh,1d2g2tv3t1ah6000,5.0,Ricoh is very big of work/life balance.  This helped a great deal and made it more enjoyable to be employed with them.

From a ""Managerial and Co-worker perspective"", there is usually someone at any designated ""Work Site"" who is willing and able to teach and train from viewing an online video exam and / or hands-on-training.

If you have a family do not work for this company. Like the other person said over 1000 people were lay-off of nationwide."
Ricoh,1d23kk6gib85t800,1.0,I worked through a third party contractor (capital staffing) there for about 3 months and my main manager had to have open heart surgery so I got stuck with a nasty mean old lady. My supervisor was okay but rude too. They’re way too strict about their breaks. It’s a strike if you’re even a minute late back from break or a MINUTE LATE to work.
